 Large Scale Analysis of Multitasking Behavior During Remote Meetings	Hancheng Cao, ChiaJung Lee, Shamsi Iqbal, Mary Czerwinski, Priscilla Wong, Sean Rintel, Brent Hecht, Jaime Teevan, Longqi Yang	hanchcao@stanford.edu	None	Virtual meetings are critical for remote work because of the need for synchronous collaboration in the absence of in-person interactions. In-meeting multitasking is closely linked to people‚Äôs productivity and wellbeing. However, we currently have limited understanding of multitasking in remote meetings and its potential impact. In this paper, we present what we believe is the most comprehensive study of remote meeting multitasking behavior through an analysis of a large-scale telemetry dataset collected from February to May 2020 of U.S. Microsoft employees and a 715-person diary study. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic meeting characteristics such as size, length, time, and type, significantly correlate with the extent to which people multitask, and multitasking can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Our findings suggest important best-practice guidelines for remote meetings (e.g., avoid important meetings in the morning) and design implications for productivity tools (e.g., support positive remote multitasking).	
 1 Introduction			None	Previously we have studied the Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) in asymptotically A d S 3 ùê¥ ùëë subscript ùëÜ 3 AdS_{3} italic_A italic_d italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT background, and have shown that the theory is free of negative-energy bulk modes. Also we have shown GMMG avoids the aforementioned ‚Äúbulk-boundary unitarity clash‚Äù. Here instead of A d S 3 ùê¥ ùëë subscript ùëÜ 3 AdS_{3} italic_A italic_d italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT space we consider asymptotically flat space, and study this model in the flat limit. The dual field theory of GMMG in the flat limit is a B M S 3 ùêµ ùëÄ subscript ùëÜ 3 BMS_{3} italic_B italic_M italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT invariant field theory, dubbed (BMSFT) and we have BMS algebra asymptotically instead of Virasoro algebra. In fact here we present an evidence for this claim. Entanglement entropy of GMMG is calculated in the background in the flat null infinity. Our evidence for mentioned claim is the result for entanglement entropy in filed theory side and in the bulk (in the gravity side). At first using Cardy formula and Rindler transformation, we calculate entanglement entropy of BMSFT in three different cases. Zero temperature on the plane and on the cylinder, and non-zero temperature case. Then we obtain the entanglement entropy in the bulk. Our results in gravity side are exactly in agreement with field theory calculations.	
 Extensions of the AZ-algorithm and the Package MultiIntegrate	Jakob Ablinger	None	None	We extend the (continuous) multivariate Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm in order to apply it for instance to special Feynman integrals emerging in renormalizable Quantum field Theories. We will consider multidimensional integrals over hyperexponential integrals and try to find closed form representations in terms of nested sums and products or iterated integrals. In addition, if we fail to compute a closed form solution in full generality, we may succeed in computing the first coefficients of the Laurent series expansions of such integrals in terms of indefinite nested sums and products or iterated integrals. In this article we present the corresponding methods and algorithms. Our Mathematica package MultiIntegrate , can be considered as an enhanced implementation of the (continuous) multivariate Almkvist Zeilberger algorithm to compute recurrences or differential equations for hyperexponential integrands and integrals. Together with the summation package Sigma and the package HarmonicSums our package provides methods to compute closed form representations (or coefficients of the Laurent series expansions) of multidimensional integrals over hyperexponential integrands in terms of nested sums or iterated integrals.	
 1 Introduction			None	We present an alternative implementation of the Kalman filter employed for track fitting within the LHCb experiment. It uses simple parametrizations for the extrapolation of particle trajectories in the field of the LHCb dipole magnet and for the effects of multiple scattering in the detector material. A speedup of more than a factor of four is achieved while maintaining the quality of the estimated track quantities. This Kalman filter implementation could be used in the purely software-based trigger of the LHCb upgrade.	
 CML-COVID: a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter dataset with latent topics, sentiment and location information	blackHassan DashtianComputational Media Lab,School of Journalism and Media,Moody College of Communication,The University of Texas at AustinblackDhiraj MurthyComputational Media Lab,School of Journalism and Media,Moody College of Communication,The University of Texas at Austin	None	None	As a platform, Twitter has been a significant public space for discussion related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public social media platforms such as Twitter represent important sites of engagement regarding the pandemic and these data can be used by research teams for social, health, and other research. Understanding public opinion about COVID-19 and how information diffuses in social media is important for governments and research institutions. Twitter is a ubiquitous public platform and, as such, has tremendous utility for understanding public perceptions, behavior, and attitudes related to COVID-19. In this research, we present CML-COVID, a COVID-19 Twitter data set of 19,298,967 million tweets from 5,977,653 unique individuals and summarize some of the attributes of these data. These tweets were collected between March 2020 and July 2020 using the query terms ‚Äòcoronavirus‚Äô, ‚Äòcovid‚Äô and ‚Äòmask‚Äô related to COVID-19. We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and descriptive statistics to describe the tweets related to COVID-19 we collected and the geographical location of tweets, where available. We provide information on how to access our tweet dataset (archived using twarc) at \color bluehttps://doi.org/10.18738/T8/W1CHVU .

Additionally, four new measurements of the orbital astrometry were collected with the CHARA Array.

We also include a discussion of the evolutionary history of this system from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) model grid to show that this WR star likely formed primarily through mass loss in the stellar winds, with only a moderate amount of mass lost or transferred through binary interactions.	
 Kashiwara‚Äôs theorem for twisted arithmetic differential operators	Christine Huyghe, Tobias Schmidt	huyghe@math.unistra.fr	IRMA, Universit√© de Strasbourg, 7 rue Ren√© Descartes, 67084 Strasbourg cedex, France	We establish a version of Kashiwara‚Äôs theorem for twisted sheaves of Berthelot‚Äôs arithmetic differential operators for a closed immersion between smooth p ùëù p italic_p -adic formal schemes.

 PIG-Net: Inception based Deep Learning Architecture for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation	Sindhu, Shankar	sindhu.hegde@research.iiit.ac.in	IIIT Hyderabad, India	Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of surface geometry of 3D objects, have gained increasing popularity with the evolution of deep learning networks for classification and segmentation tasks. Unlike human, teaching the machine to analyze the segments of an object is a challenging task and quite essential in various machine vision applications. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation and labelling of the 3D point clouds by proposing a inception based deep network architecture called PIG-Net, that effectively characterizes the local and global geometric details of the point clouds. In PIG-Net, the local features are extracted from the transformed input points using the proposed inception layers and then aligned by feature transform. These local features are aggregated using the global average pooling layer to obtain the global features. Finally, feed the concatenated local and global features to the convolution layers for segmenting the 3D point clouds. We perform an exhaustive experimental analysis of the PIG-Net architecture on two state-of-the-art datasets, namely, ShapeNet Yi et al. ( 2016 ) and PartNet Mo et al. ( 2019 ) . We evaluate the effectiveness of our network by performing ablation study.	
 Modelling the Impact of Scandals: the case of the 2017 French Presidential Election	Yassine Bouachrine and Carole Adam	None	None	This paper proposes an agent-based simulation of a presidential election, inspired by the French 2017 presidential election. The simulation is based on data extracted from polls, media coverage, and Twitter. The main contribution is to consider the impact of scandals and media bashing on the result of the election. In particular, it is shown that scandals can lead to higher abstention at the election, as voters have no relevant candidate left to vote for. The simulation is implemented in Unity 3D and is available to play online. Keywords: agent-based simulation, computational social choice, voting models

 1 Introduction			None	We illustrate the observability of the end stages of the earliest (Population III) stars at high redshifts z ‚â≥ 10 greater-than-or-equivalent-to ùëß 10 z\gtrsim 10 italic_z ‚â≥ 10 , using the recently observed transient, GN-z11-flash as an example. We find that the observed spectrum of this transient is consistent with its originating from a shock-breakout in a Population III supernova occurring in the GN-z11 galaxy at z ‚àº 11 similar-to ùëß 11 z\sim 11 italic_z ‚àº 11 .

We forecast the expected number of such transients from z > 10 ùëß 10 z>10 italic_z > 10 galaxies as a function of their host stellar mass and star formation rate. Our findings are important in the context of future searches to detect and identify the signatures of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.	
 Krylov-Simplex method that minimizes the residual in ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm or ‚Ñì_‚àû-norm. Draft version of 27 jan 2021	Wim Vanroose, Jeffrey Cornelis	wim.vanroose@uantwerpen.be	None	The paper presents two variants of a Krylov-Simplex iterative method that combines Krylov and simplex iterations to minimize the residual r = b ‚àí A x ùëü ùëè ùê¥ ùë• r=b-Ax italic_r = italic_b - italic_A italic_x . The first method minimizes ‚Äñ r ‚Äñ ‚àû subscript norm ùëü \|r\|_{\infty} ‚à• italic_r ‚à• start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àû end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , i.e. maximum of the absolute residuals. The second minimizes ‚Äñ r ‚Äñ 1 subscript norm ùëü 1 \|r\|_{1} ‚à• italic_r ‚à• start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and finds the solution with the least absolute residuals. Both methods search for an optimal solution x k subscript ùë• ùëò x_{k} italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in a Krylov subspace which results in a small linear programming problem. A specialized simplex algorithm solves this projected problem and finds the optimal linear combination of Krylov basis vectors to approximate the solution. The resulting simplex algorithm requires the solution of a series of small dense linear systems that only differ by rank-one updates. The Q R ùëÑ ùëÖ QR italic_Q italic_R factorization of these matrices is updated each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods with numerical experiments.	
 Influence of Furnace Baking on Q-E Behavior of Superconducting Accelerating Cavities	Ito, Araki, Takahashi, Umemori	hayato.ito@kek.jp	None	The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities depends on the niobium surface condition. Recently, various heat-treatment methods have been investigated to achieve unprecedented high quality factor (Q) and high accelerating field (E). We report the influence of a new baking process called furnace baking on the Q-E behavior of 1.3 GHz SRF cavities. Furnace baking is performed as the final step of the cavity surface treatment; the cavities are heated in a vacuum furnace for 3 h, followed by high-pressure rinsing and radio-frequency measurement. This method is simpler and potentially more reliable than previously reported heat-treatment methods, and it is therefore, easier to apply to the SRF cavities. We find that the quality factor is increased after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 300 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C to 400 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C, while strong decreasing the quality factor at high accelerating field is observed after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 600 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C to 800 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C. We find significant differences in the surface resistance for various processing temperatures.	
 Towards Domain Invariant Single Image Dehazing	Pranjay ShyamKukJin YoonKyungsoo Kim	None	None	Presence of haze in images obscures underlying information, which is undesirable in applications requiring accurate environment information. To recover such an image, a dehazing algorithm should localize and recover affected regions while ensuring consistency between recovered and its neighboring regions. However owing to fixed receptive field of convolutional kernels and non uniform haze distribution, assuring consistency between regions is difficult. In this paper, we utilize an encoder-decoder based network architecture to perform the task of dehazing and integrate an spatially aware channel attention mechanism to enhance features of interest beyond the receptive field of traditional conventional kernels. To ensure performance consistency across diverse range of haze densities, we utilize greedy localized data augmentation mechanism. Synthetic datasets are typically used to ensure a large amount of paired training samples, however the methodology to generate such samples introduces a gap between them and real images while accounting for only uniform haze distribution and overlooking more realistic scenario of non-uniform haze distribution resulting in inferior dehazing performance when evaluated on real datasets. Despite this, the abundance of paired samples within synthetic datasets cannot be ignored. Thus to ensure performance consistency across diverse datasets, we train the proposed network within an adversarial prior-guided framework that relies on a generated image along with its low and high frequency components to determine if properties of dehazed images matches those of ground truth. We preform extensive experiments to validate the dehazing and domain invariance performance of proposed framework across diverse domains and report state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The source code with pretrained models will be available at https://github.com/PS06/DIDH.

 Privacy-preserving Channel Estimation in Cell-free Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems	JunXu,XiaodongWang,,PengchengZhu, ,andXiaohuYou,	None	None	We consider a cell-free hybrid massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with K ùêæ K italic_K users and M ùëÄ M italic_M access points (APs), each with N a subscript ùëÅ ùëé N_{a} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT antennas and N r < N a subscript ùëÅ ùëü subscript ùëÅ ùëé N_{r}<N_{a} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT radio frequency (RF) chains. When K ‚â™ M N a much-less-than ùêæ ùëÄ subscript ùëÅ ùëé K\ll M{N_{a}} italic_K ‚â™ italic_M italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , efficient uplink channel estimation and data detection with reduced number of pilots can be performed based on low-rank matrix completion. However, such a scheme requires the central processing unit (CPU) to collect received signals from all APs, which may enable the CPU to infer the private information of user locations. We therefore develop and analyze privacy-preserving channel estimation schemes under the framework of differential privacy (DP). As the key ingredient of the channel estimator, two joint differentially private noisy matrix completion algorithms based respectively on Frank-Wolfe iteration and singular value decomposition are presented. We provide an analysis on the tradeoff between the privacy and the channel estimation error. In particular, we show that the estimation error can be mitigated while maintaining the same privacy level by increasing the payload size with fixed pilot size; and the scaling laws of both the privacy-induced and privacy-independent error components in terms of payload size are characterized. Simulation results are provided to further demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and channel estimation performance.

 Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Grammatical Error Correction via Meta-Learning	Shengsheng Zhang,,Yaping Huang,Yun Chen,Liner Yang,Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, ChinaBeijing Language and Culture University, Beijing, ChinaShanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, ChinaBeijing University of Technology, Beijing, China	None	None	Most existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) methods based on sequence-to-sequence mainly focus on how to generate more pseudo data to obtain better performance. Few work addresses few-shot GEC domain adaptation. In this paper, we treat different GEC domains as different GEC tasks and propose to extend meta-learning to few-shot GEC domain adaptation without using any pseudo data. We exploit a set of data-rich source domains to learn the initialization of model parameters that facilitates fast adaptation on new resource-poor target domains. We adapt GEC model to the first language (L1) of the second language learner. To evaluate the proposed method, we use nine L1s as source domains and five L1s as target domains. Experiment results on the L1 GEC domain adaptation dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the multi-task transfer learning baseline by 0.50 F 0.5 subscript ùêπ 0.5 F_{0.5} italic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0.5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT score on average and enables us to effectively adapt to a new L1 domain with only 200 parallel sentences.	
 High bandwidth laser-frequency-locking for wideband noise suppression	Mingyong Jing, ,, Peng Zhang, , Shaoxin Yuan, , Linjie Zhang, ,, Liantuan Xiao, , and Suotang Jia,	None	\authormark1State Key Laboratory of Quantum Optics and Quantum Optics Devices, Institute of Laser Spectroscopy, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030006, China\authormark2Collaborative Innovation Cen	Ultra-low frequency noise lasers have been widely used in laser-based experiments. Most narrow-linewidth lasers are implemented by actively suppressing their frequency noise through a frequency noise servo loop (FNSL). The loop bandwidths (LBW) of FNSLs are currently below megahertz, which is gradually tricky to meet application requirements, especially for wideband quantum sensing experiments. This article has experimentally implemented an FNSL with loop-delay-limited 3.5 MHz LBW, which is an order higher than the usual FNSLs. Using this FNSL, we achieved 70 dB laser frequency noise suppression over 100 kHz Fourier frequency range. This technology has broad applications in vast fields where wideband laser frequency noise suppression is inevitable.	
 The Galactic Chemical Evolution of Chlorine	Maas, Pilachowski	None	None	We measured 35 35 {}^{35} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 35 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Cl abundances in 52 M giants with metallicities between ‚Äì0.5 < < < [Fe/H] < < < 0.12. Abundances and atmospheric parameters were derived using infrared spectra from CSHELL on the IRTF and from optical echelle spectra. We measured Cl abundances by fitting a H 35 35 {}^{35} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 35 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Cl molecular feature at 3.6985 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m with synthetic spectra. We also measured the abundances of O, Ca, Ti, and Fe using atomic absorption lines. We find that the [Cl/Fe] ratio for our stars agrees with chemical evolution models of Cl and the [Cl/Ca] ratio is broadly consistent with the solar ratio over our metallicity range. Both indicate that Cl is primarily made in core-collapse supernovae with some contributions from Type Ia SN. We suggest other potential nucleosynthesis processes, such as the ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ -process, are not significant producers of Cl. Finally, we also find our Cl abundances are consistent with H II and planetary nebular abundances at a given oxygen abundance, although there is scatter in the data.	
 An Optimal Control Strategy for Mathematically Modeling Cancer Combination Therapy	Dulles Math and Science AcademyPresented at the rdSystems Approaches to Cancer Biology ConferenceNovember th th,	None	None	While the use of combination therapy is increasing in prevalence for cancer treatment, it is often difficult to predict the exact interactions between different treatment forms, and their synergistic/antagonistic effects on patient health and therapy outcome. In this research, a system of ordinary differential equations is constructed to model nonlinear dynamics between tumor cells, immune cells, and three forms of therapy: chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy. This model is then used to generate optimized combination therapy plans using optimal control theory. In-silico experiments are conducted to simulate the response of the patient model to various treatment plans. This is the first mathematical model in current literature to introduce radiotherapy as an option alongside immuno- and chemotherapy, permitting more flexible and effective treatment plans that reflect modern therapeutic approaches.

 Stabilizing current-driven steady flows of 180^‚àò domain walls in spin valves by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction	Jiaxin Du, Mei Li, Jie Lu	None	None	Modulations of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) on current-driven dynamics of 180 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT domain walls (180DWs) in long and narrow spin valves (LNSVs) with heavy-metal caplayers are systematically investigated. We focus on LNSVs with in-plane magnetic anisotropy in their free layers. For planar-transverse polarizers (pinned layers of LNSVs), the Walker breakdown can be postponed considerably (practical infinity) by iDMI. More interestingly, the originally unstable traveling mode is also stabilized by iDMI with high saturation velocity thus serves as fast carrier of information. For parallel polarizers, the Walker limit is increased and the corresponding modifications of iDMI to wall velocity in both steady and precessional flows of 180DWs are provided. For perpendicular polarizers, precessional flow of 180DWs is absent due to the stability of stationary mode beyond the modified Walker limit. For LNSVs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in their free layers, similar results are obtained. Our findings open new possibilities for developing magnetic nanodevices based on 180DW propagation with low energy consumption and high robustness.	
 Singular extremals in ùêø¬π-optimal control problems: sufficient optimality conditions	Francesca Chittaro, Laura Poggiolini	None	Universit√© de Toulon, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LIS, Marseille, France	In this paper we are concerned with generalised L 1 superscript ùêø 1 L^{1} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -minimisation problems, i.e. Bolza problems involving the absolute value of the control with a control-affine dynamics. We establish sufficient conditions for the strong local optimality of extremals given by the concatenation of bang, singular and inactive (zero) arcs. The sufficiency of such conditions is proved by means of Hamiltonian methods. As a by-product of the result, we provide an explicit invariant formula for the second variation along the singular arc.	
 Novel Recording Studio Features for Music Information Retrieval	Ziemer, TimBremen Spatial Cognition Center, University of Bremen, Kiattipadungkul, PattararatFaculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University, Karuchit, TanyarinFaculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University	None	None	Producers of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) typically spend more time creating, shaping, mixing and mastering sounds, than with aspects of composition and arrangement. They analyze the sound by close listening and by leveraging audio metering and audio analysis tools, until they successfully created the desired sound aesthetics. DJs of EDM tend to play sets of songs that meet their sound ideal. We therefore suggest using audio metering and monitoring tools from the recording studio to analyze EDM, instead of relying on conventional low-level audio features. We test our novel set of features by a simple classification task. We attribute songs to DJs who would play the specific song. This new set of features and the focus on DJ sets is targeted at EDM as it takes the producer and DJ culture into account. With simple dimensionality reduction and machine learning these features enable us to attribute a song to a DJ with an accuracy of 63%. The features from the audio metering and monitoring tools in the recording studio could serve for many applications in Music Information Retrieval, such as genre, style and era classification and music recommendation for both DJs and consumers of electronic dance music.

 Arbitrary-Oriented Ship Detection through Center-Head Point Extraction	Feng Zhang, Xueying Wang, Shilin Zhou, Yingqian Wang, Yi Hou	None	None	Ship detection in remote sensing images plays a crucial role in various applications and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, existing arbitrary-oriented ship detection methods are generally developed on a set of predefined rotated anchor boxes. These predefined boxes not only lead to inaccurate angle predictions but also introduce extra hyper-parameters and high computational cost. Moreover, the prior knowledge of ship size has not been fully exploited by existing methods, which hinders the improvement of their detection accuracy. Aiming at solving the above issues, in this paper, we propose a center-head point extraction based detector (named CHPDet) to achieve arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images. Our CHPDet formulates arbitrary-oriented ships as rotated boxes with head points which are used to determine the direction. And rotated Gaussian kernel is used to map the annotations into target heatmaps. Keypoint estimation is performed to find the center of ships. Then, the size and head point of the ships are regressed. The orientation-invariant model (OIM) is also used to produce orientation-invariant feature maps. Finally, we use the target size as prior to finetune the results. Moreover, we introduce a new dataset for multi-class arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images at a fixed ground sample distance (GSD) which is named FGSD2021. Experimental results on FGSD2021 and two other widely used data sets, i.e., HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our CHPDet achieves state-of-the-art performance and can well distinguish between bow and stern. Code and FGSD2021 dataset are available at https://github.com/zf020114/CHPDet .	
 Evolutionary Multi-objective Architecture Search Framework: Application to COVID-19 3D CT Classification	Xin He, Guohao Ying, Jiyong Zhangdagger, Xiaowen Chudagger	None	None	The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened global health. Many studies have applied deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to recognize COVID-19 based on chest 3D computed tomography (CT). Recent works show that no model generalizes well across CT datasets from different countries, and manually designing models for specific datasets requires expertise; thus, neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to search models automatically has become an attractive solution. To reduce the search cost on large 3D CT datasets, most NAS-based works use the weight-sharing (WS) strategy to make all models share weights within a supernet; however, WS inevitably incurs search instability, leading to inaccurate model estimation. In this work, we propose an efficient E volutionary M ulti-objective AR chitecture S earch ( EMARS ) framework. We propose a new objective, namely potential , which can help exploit promising models to indirectly reduce the number of models involved in weights training, thus alleviating search instability. We demonstrate that under objectives of accuracy and potential, EMARS can balance exploitation and exploration, i.e., reducing search time and finding better models. Our searched models are small and perform better than prior works on three public COVID-19 3D CT datasets.

 Interpreting and Unifying Graph Neural Networks with An Optimization Framework	Meiqi Zhu, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi, Houye Ji, Peng Cui	zhumeiqi@bupt.edu.cn	None	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received considerable attention on graph-structured data learning for a wide variety of tasks. The well-designed propagation mechanism which has been demonstrated effective is the most fundamental part of GNNs. Although most of GNNs basically follow a message passing manner, litter effort has been made to discover and analyze their essential relations. In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between different propagation mechanisms with a unified optimization problem, showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed propagation mechanisms are the optimal solution optimizing a feature fitting function over a wide class of graph kernels with a graph regularization term. Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize na√Øve graph convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass or high-pass filtering capabilities respectively. Moreover, we provide the convergence proofs and expressive power comparisons for the proposed models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that the proposed GNNs not only outperform the state-of-the-art methods but also have good ability to alleviate over-smoothing, and further verify the feasibility for designing GNNs with our unified optimization framework.	
 Dynamical signatures of symmetry protected topology following symmetry breaking	Jacob Marks, Michael Schler, Thomas Devereaux	jamarks@stanford.edu	None	We investigate topological signatures in the short-time non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry protected topological (SPT) systems starting from initial states which break a protecting symmetry. Na√Øvely, one might expect that topology loses meaning when a protecting symmetry is broken. Defying this intuition, we illustrate, in an interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, how this combination of symmetry breaking and quench dynamics can give rise to both single-particle and many-body signatures of topology. From the dynamics of the symmetry broken state, we find that we are able to dynamically probe the equilibrium topological phase diagram of a symmetry respecting projection of the post-quench Hamiltonian. In the ensemble dynamics, we demonstrate how spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a protecting symmetry can result in a quantized many-body topological ‚Äòinvariant‚Äô which is not pinned under unitary time evolution. We dub this ‚Äòdynamical many-body topology‚Äô (DMBT). We show numerically that both the pure state and ensemble signatures are remarkably robust, and argue that these non-equilibrium signatures should be quite generic in SPT systems, regardless of protecting symmetries or spatial dimension.	
 Localization in the Kicked Ising Chain	Daniel Waltner, Petr Braun	None	None	Determining the border between ergodic and localized behavior is of central interest for interacting many-body systems. We consider here the recently very popular spin-chain model that is periodically excited. A convenient description of such a many-body system is achieved by the dual operator that evolves the system in contrast to the time-evolution operator not in time but in particle direction. We identify in this paper the largest eigenvalue of a function based on the dual operator as a convenient tool to determine if the system shows ergodic or many-body localized features. By perturbation theory in the vicinity of the noninteracting system we explain analytically the eigenvalue structure and compare it with numerics in [P. Braun, D. Waltner, M. Akila, B. Gutkin, T. Guhr, Phys. Rev. E 101 , 052201 (2020)] for small times. Furthermore we identify a quantity that allows based on extensive large-time numerical computations of the spectral form factor to distinguish between localized and ergodic system features and to determine the Thouless time, i.e. the transition time between these regimes in the thermodynamic limit.	
 Covariance Prediction via Convex Optimization	Shane Barratt, Stephen Boyd	None	None	We consider the problem of predicting the covariance of a zero mean Gaussian vector, based on another feature vector. We describe a covariance predictor that has the form of a generalized linear model, i.e. , an affine function of the features followed by an inverse link function that maps vectors to symmetric positive definite matrices. The log-likelihood is a concave function of the predictor parameters, so fitting the predictor involves convex optimization. Such predictors can be combined with others, or recursively applied to improve performance.	
 Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Monocular Depth Estimation Using Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization	Renya DaimostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Satoshi OnostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Takahiro SuzukistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	"11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Information Science and Biomedical Engineering,
Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University1-21-40, Korimoto, Ka"	This paper proposes an adversarial attack method to deep neural networks (DNNs) for monocular depth estimation, i.e., estimating the depth from a single image. Single image depth estimation has improved drastically in recent years due to the development of DNNs. However, vulnerabilities of DNNs for image classification have been revealed by adversarial attacks, and DNNs for monocular depth estimation could contain similar vulnerabilities. Therefore, research on vulnerabilities of DNNs for monocular depth estimation has spread rapidly, but many of them assume white-box conditions where inside information of DNNs is available, or are transferability-based black-box attacks that require a substitute DNN model and a training dataset. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, the proposed method in this paper analyzes DNNs under the black-box condition where only output depth maps are available. In addition, the proposed method does not require a substitute DNN that has a similar architecture to the target DNN nor any knowledge about training data used to train the target model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method succeeded in attacking two DNN-based methods that were trained with indoor and outdoor scenes respectively.	
 Automatic Segmentation of Gross Target Volume of Nasopharynx Cancer using Ensemble of Multiscale Deep Neural Networks with Spatial Attention	Haochen Mei, Wenhui Lei, Ran Gu, Shan Ye, Zhengwentai Sun, Shichuan Zhang, Guotai Wang	None	School¬†of¬† Mechanical¬† and¬† Electrical ¬†Engineering, ¬†University¬† of¬† Electronic ¬†Science¬† and ¬†Technology ¬†of ¬†China,¬† Chengdu,¬† China	Radiotherapy is the main treatment method for nasopharynx cancer. Delineation of Gross Target Volume (GTV) from medical images is a prerequisite for radiotherapy. As manual delineation is time-consuming and laborious, automatic segmentation of GTV has a potential to improve the efficiency of this process. This work aims to automatically segment GTV of nasopharynx cancer from Computed Tomography (CT) images. However, it is challenged by the small target region, anisotropic resolution of clinical CT images, and the low contrast between the target region and surrounding soft tissues. To deal with these problems, we propose a 2.5D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to handle the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions. We also propose a spatial attention module to enable the network to focus on the small target, and use channel attention to further improve the segmentation performance. Moreover, we use a multi-scale sampling method for training so that the networks can learn features at different scales, which are combined with a multi-model ensemble method to improve the robustness of segmentation results. We also estimate the uncertainty of segmentation results based on our model ensemble, which is of great importance for indicating the reliability of automatic segmentation results for radiotherapy planning. Experiments with 2019 MICCAI StructSeg dataset showed that (1) Our proposed 2.5D network has a better performance on images with anisotropic resolution than the commonly used 3D networks. (2) Our attention mechanism can make the network pay more attention to the small GTV region and improve the segmentation accuracy. (3) The proposed multi-scale model ensemble achieves more robust results, and it can simultaneously obtain uncertainty information that can indicate potential mis-segmentations for better clinical decisions.

 Multi-Dimensional Parameter Study of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae Originating from Thin-Helium-Shell White Dwarfs	Samuel Boos, Dean Townsley, Ken Shen, Spencer Caldwell, Broxton Miles	"Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USADepartment of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USADepartment of Astronomy and Theoretical Astrophysics Center,
University of California, Berkeley, CA, USADepartment of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USAApplied Research Associates, Inc. Raleigh, NC, USA"	None	Despite the importance of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) throughout astronomy, the precise progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that drive SNe Ia are still unknown. An explosion scenario that has gained traction recently is the double detonation in which an accreted shell of He detonates and triggers a secondary detonation in the underlying white dwarf. Our research presents a number of high resolution, multi-dimensional, full star simulations of thin-He-shell, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitors that undergo a double detonation. This suite of thin-shell progenitors incorporates He shells that are thinner than those in previous multi-dimensional studies. We confirm the viability of the double detonation across a range of He shell parameter space as well as present bulk yields and ejecta profiles for each progenitor. The yields obtained are generally consistent with previous works and indicate the likelihood of producing observables that resemble SNe Ia. The dimensionality of our simulations allow us to examine features of the double detonation more closely, including the details of the off-center secondary ignition and asymmetric ejecta. We find considerable differences in the high-velocity extent of post-detonation products across different lines of sight. The data from this work will be used to generate predicted observables and may further support the viability of the double detonation scenario as a SNe Ia channel as well as show how properties of the progenitor or viewing angle may influence trends in observable characteristics.	
 Environment-Adaptive Multiple Access for Distributed V2X Network: A Reinforcement Learning Framework	Seungmo Kim,,, ByungJun Kim, and Brian Park,,	None	None	Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications amass research interest in recent days because of its ability to schedule multiple access more efficiently as compared to its predecessor technology, i.e., dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). However, the foremost issue still remains: a vehicle needs to keep the V2X performance in a highly dynamic environment. This paper proposes a way to exploit the dynamicity. That is, we propose a resource allocation mechanism adaptive to the environment, which can be an efficient solution for air interface congestion that a V2X network often suffers from. Specifically, the proposed mechanism aims at granting a higher chance of transmission to a vehicle with a higher crash risk. As such, the channel access is prioritized to those with urgent needs. The adaptation is implemented based on reinforcement learning (RL). We model the RL framework as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB), which provides efficiency as well as accuracy. We highlight the most superb aspect of the proposed mechanism: it is designed to be operated at a vehicle autonomously without need for any assistance from a central entity. Henceforth, the proposed framework is expected to make a particular fit to distributed V2X network such as C-V2X mode 4.

At the end of this paper, we discuss these challenges and suggest potential solutions to address them.	
 LEVERAGING 3D INFORMATION IN UNSUPERVISED BRAIN MRI SEGMENTATION			None	Automatic segmentation of brain abnormalities is challenging, as they vary considerably from one pathology to another. Current methods are supervised and require numerous annotated images for each pathology, a strenuous task. To tackle anatomical variability, Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods are proposed, detecting anomalies as outliers of a healthy model learned using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Previous work on UAD adopted a 2D approach, meaning that MRIs are processed as a collection of independent slices. Yet, it does not fully exploit the spatial information contained in MRI. Here, we propose to perform UAD in a 3D fashion and compare 2D and 3D VAEs. As a side contribution, we present a new loss function guarantying a robust training. Learning is performed using a multicentric dataset of healthy brain MRIs, and segmentation performances are estimated on White-Matter Hyperintensities and tumors lesions. Experiments demonstrate the interest of 3D methods which outperform their 2D counterparts.	
 Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series	Satya Narayan Shukla Benjamin MarlinCollege of Information and Computer SciencesUniversity of Massachusetts AmherstAmherst, MA , USA	None	None	Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for this setting that we call Multi-Time Attention Networks . Multi-Time Attention Networks learn an embedding of continuous time values and use an attention mechanism to produce a fixed-length representation of a time series containing a variable number of observations. We investigate the performance of this framework on interpolation and classification tasks using multiple datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach performs as well or better than a range of baseline and recently proposed models while offering significantly faster training times than current state-of-the-art methods. 1 1 1 Implementation available at : https://github.com/reml-lab/mTAN	
 LOME: Large Ontology Multilingual Extraction	Patrick Xia, Guanghui Qin, Siddharth VashishthaJohns Hopkins University,University of Rochester	None	None	We present LOME, a system for performing multilingual information extraction. Given a text document as input, our core system identifies spans of textual entity and event mentions with a FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998 ) parser. It subsequently performs coreference resolution, fine-grained entity typing, and temporal relation prediction between events. By doing so, the system constructs an event and entity focused knowledge graph. We can further apply third-party modules for other types of annotation, like relation extraction. Our (multilingual) first-party modules either outperform or are competitive with the (monolingual) state-of-the-art. We achieve this through the use of multilingual encoders like XLM-R Conneau et al. ( 2020 ) and leveraging multilingual training data. LOME is available as a Docker container on Docker Hub. In addition, a lightweight version of the system is accessible as a web demo.	
 Is a Miracle-less WIMP Ruled out?	Jason Arakawa, Tim MP Tait	None	None	We examine a real electroweak triplet scalar field as dark matter, abandoning the requirement that its relic abundance is determined through freeze out in a standard cosmological history (a situation which we refer to as ‚Äòmiracle-less WIMP‚Äô). We extract the bounds on such a particle from collider searches, searches for direct scattering with terrestrial targets, and searches for the indirect products of annihilation. Each type of search provides complementary information, and each is most effective in a different region of parameter space. LHC searches tend to be highly dependent on the mass of the SU(2) charged partner state, and are effective for very large or very tiny mass splitting between it and the neutral dark matter component. Direct searches are very effective at bounding the Higgs portal coupling, but ineffective once it falls below Œª eff ‚â≤ 10 ‚àí 3 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùúÜ eff superscript 10 3 \lambda_{\text{eff}}\lesssim 10^{-3} italic_Œª start_POSTSUBSCRIPT eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT .

Synthesizing the allowed parameter space, this example of WIMP dark matter remains viable, but only in miracle-less regimes.	
 A tuned mass amplifier for enhanced haptic feedback	Sai Sharan Injeti, Ali Israr, Tianshu Liu, Yiit Meng, Daniele Piazza, Dongsuk Shin	None	None	Vibro-tactile feedback is, by far the most common haptic interface in wearable or touchable devices. This feedback can be amplified by controlling the wave propagation characteristics in devices, by utilizing phenomena such as structural resonance. However, much of the work in vibro-tactile haptics has focused on amplifying local displacements in a structure by increasing local compliance. In this paper, we show that engineering the resonance mode shape of a structure with embedded localized mass amplifies the displacements without compromising on the stiffness or resonance frequency. The resulting structure, i.e., a tuned mass amplifier , produces higher tactile forces (7.7 times) compared to its counterpart without a mass, while maintaining a low frequency. We optimize the proposed design using a combination of a neural network and sensitivity analysis, and validate the results with experiments on 3-D printed structures. We also study the performance of the device on contact with a soft material, to evaluate the interaction with skin. Potential avenues for future work are also presented, including small form factor wearable haptic devices and remote haptics.

 The Evolutionary Pathways of Disk-, Bulge-, and Halo-dominated Galaxies	Min Du, Luis Ho, Victor Debattista, Annalisa Pillepich, Dylan Nelson, Lars Hernquist, Rainer Weinberger	None	None	To break the degeneracy among galactic stellar components, we extract kinematic structures using the framework described in Du et al. ( 2019 , 2020 ) . For example, the concept of stellar halos is generalized to weakly-rotating structures that are composed of loosely bound stars, which can hence be associated to both disk and elliptical type morphologies. By applying this method to central galaxies with stellar mass 10 10 ‚àí 11.5 M ‚äô superscript 10 10 11.5 subscript ùëÄ direct-product 10^{10-11.5}\ M_{\odot} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 - 11.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from the TNG50 simulation, we identify three broadly-defined types of galaxies: ones dominated by disk, by bulge, or by stellar halo structures. We then use the simulation to infer the underlying connection between the growth of structures and physical processes over cosmic time. Tracing galaxies back in time, we recognize three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution ( z ‚â≥ 2 greater-than-or-equivalent-to ùëß 2 z\gtrsim 2 italic_z ‚â≥ 2 ), and internal and external (mainly mergers) processes that act at later times. We find that disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies are not significantly affected by mergers since z ‚àº 2 similar-to ùëß 2 z\sim 2 italic_z ‚àº 2 ; the difference in their present-day structures originates from two distinct evolutionary pathways, extended vs. compact, that are likely determined by their parent dark matter halos; i.e., nature. On the other hand, slow rotator elliptical galaxies are typically halo-dominated, forming by external processes (e.g. mergers) in the later phase, i.e., nurture. This picture challenges the general idea that elliptical galaxies are the same objects as classical bulges. In observations, both bulge- and halo-dominated galaxies are likely to be classified as early-type galaxies with compact morphology and quiescent star formation. However, here we find them to have very different evolutionary histories.

We prove linear convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm with optimal algebraic rates. Unlike prior work, we do not only consider rates with respect to the number of degrees of freedom but even prove optimal complexity, i.e., optimal convergence rates with respect to the total computational cost.

 Connecting the formation of stars and planets. II: coupling the angular momentum of stars with the angular momentum of planets	FlorTorres, Coziol, KP Schrder, Jack, and Schmitt, 	None	"L. M. Flor-Torres, R. Coziol, K.-P. Schr√∂der, D. Jack : Departamento de Astronom√≠a, Universidad de Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Gto, M√©xico.
J. H. M. M. Schmitt: Hamburger Sternwarte, Universit√§t Hamburg, "	A sample of 46 stars, host of exoplanets, is used to search for a connection between their formation process and the formation of the planets rotating around them. Separating our sample in two, stars hosting high-mass exoplanets (HMEs) and low-mass exoplanets (LMEs), we found the former to be more massive and to rotate faster than the latter. We also found the HMEs to have higher orbital angular momentum than the LMEs and to have lost more angular momentum through migration. These results are consistent with the view that the more massive the star and higher its rotation, the more massive was its protoplanetarys disk and rotation, and the more efficient the extraction of angular momentum from the planets.

 Spillway Preheating	JiJi Fan, Kaloian Lozanov, Qianshu Lu	None	None	In traditional models only an order one fraction of energy is transferred from the inflaton to radiation through nonperturbative resonance production in preheating immediately after inflation, due to backreaction effects. We propose a particle production mechanism that could improve the depletion of the inflaton energy density by up to four orders of magnitude. The improvement comes from the fast perturbative decays of resonantly produced daughter particles. They act as a ‚Äúspillway‚Äù to drain these daughter particles, reducing their backreaction on the inflaton and keeping the resonant production effective for a longer period. Thus we dub the scenario ‚Äúspillway preheating‚Äù. We also show that the fraction of energy density remaining in the inflaton has a simple inverse power-law scaling in the scenario. In general, spillway preheating is a much more efficient energy dissipation mechanism, which may have other applications in model building for particle physics.	
 Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Based Power Allocation in a Massive MIMO Network	ManojdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Meysam Sadeghi, and Erik LarssondaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Deep learning (DL) is becoming popular as a new tool for many applications in wireless communication systems. However, for many classification tasks (e.g., modulation classification) it has been shown that DL-based wireless systems are susceptible to adversarial examples; adversarial examples are well-crafted malicious inputs to the neural network (NN) with the objective to cause erroneous outputs. In this paper, we extend this to regression problems and show that adversarial attacks can break DL-based power allocation in the downlink of a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (maMIMO) network. Specifically, we extend the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), momentum iterative FGSM, and projected gradient descent adversarial attacks in the context of power allocation in a maMIMO system. We benchmark the performance of these attacks and show that with a small perturbation in the input of the NN, the white-box attacks can result in infeasible solutions up to 86%. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of black-box attacks. All the evaluations conducted in this work are based on an open dataset and NN models, which are publicly available.

We show that an ‚Ñù ‚Ñù {\mathbb{R}} blackboard_R -covered transversely orientable foliation with Gromov hyperbolic leaves in a closed 3 3 3 3 -manifold admits a regulating, transverse pseudo-Anosov flow (in the appropriate sense) in each atoroidal piece of the manifold. The flow is a blow up of a one prong pseudo-Anosov flow. In addition we show that there is a regulating flow for the whole foliation. We also determine how deck transformations act on the universal circle of the foliation.	
 Multi-Dimensional Parameter Study of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae Originating from Thin-Helium-Shell White Dwarfs	Samuel Boos, Dean Townsley, Ken Shen, Spencer Caldwell, Broxton Miles	"Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USADepartment of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USADepartment of Astronomy and Theoretical Astrophysics Center,

Raleigh, NC, USA"	None	Despite the importance of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) throughout astronomy, the precise progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that drive SNe Ia are still unknown. An explosion scenario that has gained traction recently is the double detonation in which an accreted shell of He detonates and triggers a secondary detonation in the underlying white dwarf. Our research presents a number of high resolution, multi-dimensional, full star simulations of thin-He-shell, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitors that undergo a double detonation. This suite of thin-shell progenitors incorporates He shells that are thinner than those in previous multi-dimensional studies. We confirm the viability of the double detonation across a range of He shell parameter space as well as present bulk yields and ejecta profiles for each progenitor. The yields obtained are generally consistent with previous works and indicate the likelihood of producing observables that resemble SNe Ia. The dimensionality of our simulations allow us to examine features of the double detonation more closely, including the details of the off-center secondary ignition and asymmetric ejecta. We find considerable differences in the high-velocity extent of post-detonation products across different lines of sight. The data from this work will be used to generate predicted observables and may further support the viability of the double detonation scenario as a SNe Ia channel as well as show how properties of the progenitor or viewing angle may influence trends in observable characteristics.	
 Current and Emergent Economic Impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK Fresh Produce and Horticultural Businesses	Lilian Korir, Archie Drake, Martin Collison, Tania Carolina CamachoVilla, Elizabeth Sklar,, Simon Pearson	None	None	This paper describes a study designed to investigate the current and emergent impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK horticultural businesses. Various characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into 2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather information from a relatively small ( n = 19 ùëõ 19 n=19 italic_n = 19 ) but indicative group of producers. The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry (89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option (32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently, automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK‚Äôs horticultural workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points for the research community.	
 Vortex propagation and phase transitions in a chiral antiferromagnetic nanostripe	Riccardo Tomasello, Stavros Komineas	None	None	We study a vortex in a nanostripe of an antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy and interfacial Dzyloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The vortex has hybrid chirality being N√©el close to its center and Bloch away from it. Propagating vortices can acquire velocities up to a maximum value that is lower than the spin wave velocity. When the vortex is forced to exceed the maximum velocity, phase transitions occur to a nonflat spiral, vortex chain, and flat spiral, successively. The vortex chain is a topological configuration stabilised in the stripe geometry. Theoretical arguments lead to the general result that the velocity of localized excitations in chiral magnets cannot reach the spin wave velocity.	
 When Would You Trust a Robot? A Study on Trust and Theory of Mind in Human-Robot Interactions	Wenxuan MoustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Martina RuoccostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Debora ZanattostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Angelo CangelosistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Computer Science, University of Manchester, UKstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Computer Science, University of Bristol, UK	None	None	Trust is a critical issue in human‚Äìrobot interactions (HRI) as it is the core of human desire to accept and use a non-human agent. Theory of Mind (ToM) has been defined as the ability to understand the beliefs and intentions of others that may differ from one‚Äôs own. Evidences in psychology and HRI suggest that trust and ToM are interconnected and interdependent concepts, as the decision to trust another agent must depend on our own representation of this entity‚Äôs actions, beliefs and intentions. However, very few works take ToM of the robot into consideration while studying trust in HRI. In this paper, we investigated whether the exposure to the ToM abilities of a robot could affect humans‚Äô trust towards the robot. To this end, participants played a Price Game with a humanoid robot (Pepper) that was presented having either low-level ToM or high-level ToM . Specifically, the participants were asked to accept the price evaluations on common objects presented by the robot. The willingness of the participants to change their own price judgement of the objects (i.e., accept the price the robot suggested) was used as the main measurement of the trust towards the robot. Our experimental results showed that robots possessing a high-level of ToM abilities were trusted more than the robots presented with low-level ToM skills.	
 Power Beacon Placement for Maximizing Guaranteed Coverage in Bistatic Backscatter Networks	XiaolunJia,andXiangyunZhou	None	None	The bistatic backscatter architecture, with its extended range, enables flexible deployment opportunities for backscatter devices. In this paper, we study the placement of power beacons (PBs) in bistatic backscatter networks to maximize the guaranteed coverage distance (GCD), defined as the distance from the reader within which backscatter devices are able to satisfy a given quality-of-service constraint. This work departs from conventional energy source placement problems by considering the performance of the additional backscatter link on top of the energy transfer link. We adopt and optimize a symmetric PB placement scheme to maximize the GCD. The optimal PB placement under this scheme is obtained using either analytically tractable expressions or an efficient algorithm. Numerical results provide useful insights into the impacts of various system parameters on the PB placement and the resulting GCD, plus the advantages of the adopted symmetric placement scheme over other benchmark schemes.	
 The Gel‚Äôfand‚Äôs inverse problem for the graph Laplacian	Emilia Blsten, Hiroshi Isozaki, Matti Lassas and Jinpeng Lu	None	None	We study the discrete Gel‚Äôfand‚Äôs inverse boundary spectral problem of determining a finite weighted graph. Suppose that the set of vertices of the graph is a union of two disjoint sets: X = B ‚à™ G ùëã ùêµ ùê∫ X=B\cup G italic_X = italic_B ‚à™ italic_G , where B ùêµ B italic_B is called the set of the boundary vertices and G ùê∫ G italic_G is called the set of the interior vertices. We consider the case where the vertices in the set G ùê∫ G italic_G and the edges connecting them are unknown. Assume that we are given the set B ùêµ B italic_B and the pairs ( Œª j , œï j | B ) subscript ùúÜ ùëó evaluated-at subscript italic-œï ùëó ùêµ (\lambda_{j},\phi_{j}|_{B}) ( italic_Œª start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , where Œª j subscript ùúÜ ùëó \lambda_{j} italic_Œª start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian and œï j | B evaluated-at subscript italic-œï ùëó ùêµ \phi_{j}|_{B} italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the values of the corresponding eigenfunctions at the vertices in B ùêµ B italic_B . We show that the graph structure, namely the unknown vertices in G ùê∫ G italic_G and the edges connecting them, along with the weights, can be uniquely determined from the given data, if every boundary vertex is connected to only one interior vertex and the graph satisfies the following property: any subset S ‚äÜ G ùëÜ ùê∫ S\subseteq G italic_S ‚äÜ italic_G of cardinality | S | ‚©æ 2 ùëÜ 2 |S|\geqslant 2 | italic_S | ‚©æ 2 contains two extreme points. A point x ‚àà S ùë• ùëÜ x\in S italic_x ‚àà italic_S is called an extreme point of S ùëÜ S italic_S if there exists a point z ‚àà B ùëß ùêµ z\in B italic_z ‚àà italic_B such that x ùë• x italic_x is the unique nearest point in S ùëÜ S italic_S from z ùëß z italic_z with respect to the graph distance. This property is valid for several standard types of lattices and their perturbations.

Abhimanyu Gupta, Xi Qu	None	None	We propose a series-based nonparametric specification test for a regression function when data are spatially dependent, the ‚Äòspace‚Äô being of a general economic or social nature. Dependence can be parametric, parametric with increasing dimension, semiparametric or any combination thereof, thus covering a vast variety of settings. These include spatial error models of varying types and levels of complexity. Under a new smooth spatial dependence condition, our test statistic is asymptotically standard normal. To prove the latter property, we establish a central limit theorem for quadratic forms in linear processes in an increasing dimension setting. Finite sample performance is investigated in a simulation study, with a bootstrap method also justified and illustrated. Empirical examples illustrate the test with real-world data.

 Two-level Nystr√∂m‚ÄìSchur Preconditioner for Sparse Symmetric Positive Definite MatricesSubmitted to the editors January 28, 2021.	Hussam Al Daas, Tyrone Rees, Jennifer Scott	hussam.al-daas@stfc.ac.uk	None	Randomized methods are becoming increasingly popular in numerical linear algebra. However, few attempts have been made to use them in developing preconditioners. Our interest lies in solving large-scale sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems of equations where the system matrix is preordered to doubly bordered block diagonal form (for example, using a nested dissection ordering). We investigate the use of randomized methods to construct high quality preconditioners. In particular, we propose a new and efficient approach that employs Nystr√∂m‚Äôs method for computing low rank approximations to develop robust algebraic two-level preconditioners. Construction of the new preconditioners involves iteratively solving a smaller but denser symmetric positive definite Schur complement system with multiple right-hand sides. Numerical experiments on problems coming from a range of application areas demonstrate that this inner system can be solved cheaply using block conjugate gradients and that using a large convergence tolerance to limit the cost does not adversely affect the quality of the resulting Nystr√∂m‚ÄìSchur two-level preconditioner.	
 The fundamental gap of horoconvex domains in ‚Ñç^ùëõ	Xuan Hien Nguyen, Alina Stancu, Guofang Wei	xhnguyen@iastate.edu	Iowa State University	We show that, for horoconvex domains in the hyperbolic space, the product of their fundamental gap with the square of their diameter has no positive lower bound. The result follows from the study of the fundamental gap of geodesic balls as the radius goes to infinity. In the process, we improve the lower bound for the first eigenvalue of balls in hyperbolic space.

 Patient Diversion Across Primary Health Centers Using Real Time Delay Predictors	Najiya FatmastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Varun RamamohanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In the current work, we consider diversion of childbirth patients who arrive seeking emergency admission to public primary health centers (PHCs). PHCs are the first point of contact for an Indian patient with formal medical care, and offer medical care on an outpatient basis, and limited inpatient and childbirth care. In this context, real-time prediction of the wait time of the arriving patient becomes important in order to determine whether the patient must be diverted to another PHC or not. We study this problem using a discrete event simulation that we develop of medical care operations in two PHCs in India. We approximate the labour room service at each PHC as an M/G/1 queueing system and show how the accuracy of real-time delay predictors impacts the extent of the change in operational outcomes at each PHC. We simulate patient diversion using actual delays as well as the delay estimates generated by various delay predictors based on the state of the system such as queue-length, elapsed service time, and observed delay histories. The simulation of the diversion process also incorporates travel time between the PHCs. We also propose a new delay predictor that incorporates information regarding the system state as well as the service time distribution. We compare the operational outcomes at both PHCs without diversion and with diversion using the above delay predictors. We show numerically that more accurate delay predictors lead to more equitable distribution of resources involved in provision of childbirth care across both PHCs.	
 HEMVIP: Human Evaluation of Multiple Videos in Parallel	Patrik Jonell, Youngwoo Yoon, Pieter Wolfert, Taras Kucherenko, Gustav Eje Henter	pjjonell@kth.se	None	In many research areas, for example motion and gesture generation, objective measures alone do not provide an accurate impression of key stimulus traits such as perceived quality or appropriateness. The gold standard is instead to evaluate these aspects through user studies, especially subjective evaluations of video stimuli. Common evaluation paradigms either present individual stimuli to be scored on Likert-type scales, or ask users to compare and rate videos in a pairwise fashion. However, the time and resources required for such evaluations scale poorly as the number of conditions to be compared increases. Building on standards used for evaluating the quality of multimedia codecs, this paper instead introduces a framework for granular rating of multiple comparable videos in parallel. This methodology essentially analyses all condition pairs at once. Our contributions are 1) a proposed framework, called HEMVIP, for parallel and granular evaluation of multiple video stimuli and 2) a validation study confirming that results obtained using the tool are in close agreement with results of prior studies using conventional multiple pairwise comparisons.

A fully exclusive measurement of the 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne ( p , 2 p ) 16 superscript ùëù 2 ùëù 16 (p,2p)^{16} ( italic_p , 2 italic_p ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT F ‚Üí 15 * {}^{*}\rightarrow^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT * end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Üí start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT O + p ùëù +p + italic_p quasi-free one-proton knockout reaction has been performed at GSI at around 500 MeV/nucleon beam energy. All particles resulting from the scattering process have been detected. The relevant reconstructed quantities are the angles of the two protons scattered in qusi-elastic kinematics, the decay of 16 16 {}^{16} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT F into 15 15 {}^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT O (including Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ decays from excited states) and a proton, as well as the 15 15 {}^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT O + p ùëù +p + italic_p relative-energy spectrum and the 16 16 {}^{16} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT F momentum distributions. The latter two quantities allow an independent and consistent determination of the ratio of l = 0 ùëô 0 l=0 italic_l = 0 and l = 2 ùëô 2 l=2 italic_l = 2 motion of the valence protons in 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne. With a resulting relatively small l = 0 ùëô 0 l=0 italic_l = 0 component of only around 35(3)%, it is concluded that 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne exhibits a rather modest halo character only. The quantitative agreement of the two values deduced from the energy spectrum and the momentum distributions supports the theoretical treatment of the calculation of momentum distributions after quasi-free knockout reactions at high energies by taking into account distortions based on the Glauber theory. Moreover, the experimental data allow the separation of valence-proton knockout and knockout from the 15 15 {}^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT O core. The latter process contributes with 11.8(3.1) mb around 40% to the total proton-knockout cross section of 30.3(2.3) mb, which explains previously reported contradicting conclusions derived from inclusive cross sections.

 Terminus: A Versatile Simulator for Space-based Telescopes	Billy Edwards, Ian Stotesbury	None	None	Space-based telescopes offer unparalleled opportunities for characterising exoplanets, Solar System bodies and stellar objects. However, observatories in low Earth orbits (e.g. Hubble, CHEOPS, Twinkle and an ever increasing number of cubesats) cannot always be continuously pointed at a target due to Earth obscuration. For exoplanet observations consisting of transit, or eclipse, spectroscopy this causes gaps in the light curve, which reduces the information content and can diminish the science return of the observation. Terminus, a time-domain simulator, has been developed to model the occurrence of these gaps to predict the potential impact on future observations. The simulator is capable of radiometrically modelling exoplanet observations as well as producing light curves and spectra. Here, Terminus is baselined on the Twinkle mission but the model can be adapted for any space-based telescope and is especially applicable to those in a low-Earth orbit. Terminus also has the capability to model observations of other targets such as asteroids or brown dwarfs.

 Diverse Adversaries for Mitigating Bias in Training	Xudong HanTimothy BaldwinSchool of Computing and Information SystemsThe University of MelbourneVictoria , AustraliaTrevor Cohn	None	None	Adversarial learning can learn fairer and less biased models of language than standard methods. However, current adversarial techniques only partially mitigate model bias, added to which their training procedures are often unstable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adversarial learning based on the use of multiple diverse discriminators, whereby discriminators are encouraged to learn orthogonal hidden representations from one another. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves over standard adversarial removal methods, in terms of reducing bias and the stability of training.	
 Securing Full-Duplex Amplify-and-Forward Relay-Aided Transmissions Through Processing-Time Optimization	Mohamed MarzbandaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ahmed El ShafieddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ahmed SultanstarstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Naofal AlDhahirdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We investigate physical-layer security of the full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay channel. We provide a new perspective on the problem and show that the processing time (delay) at the relay can be exploited to improve the system‚Äôs security. We show that the FD AF relay channel can be seen as an intersymbol-interference (ISI) channel, hence, the discrete-Fourier transform (DFT) can be used for data modulation and demodulation to convert the frequency-selective channel into flat-fading channel per sub-channel/sub-carrier. By exploiting the fact that the channel memory needs to be cleared by inserting the cyclic-prefix, Alice injects an artificial-noise (AN) signal that hurts the eavesdropping nodes only. The strength of this AN signal and its interference rank are controlled by the relay‚Äôs processing time.	
 Sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array to dark subhalos	Javier CoronadoBlzquez, Michele Doro, Miguel SnchezConde, Alejandra AguirreSantaella	javier.coronado@uam.es	Instituto de F√≠sica Te√≥rica UAM-CSIC,Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, C/ Nicol√°s Cabrera, 13-15, 28049 Madrid, Spain	In this work, we study the potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) for the detection of Galactic dark matter (DM) subhalos. We focus on low-mass subhalos that do not host any baryonic content and therefore lack any multiwavelength counterpart. If the DM is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), these dark subhalos may thus appear in the gamma-ray sky as unidentified sources. A detailed characterization of the instrumental response of CTA to dark subhalos is performed, for which we use the ctools analysis software and simulate CTA observations under different array configurations and pointing strategies, such as the scheduled extragalactic survey. This, together with information on the subhalo population as inferred from N-body cosmological simulations, allows us to predict the CTA detectability of dark subhalos, i.e., the expected number of subhalos in each of the considered observational scenarios. In the absence of detection, for each observation strategy we set competitive limits to the annihilation cross section as a function of the DM particle mass, that are at the level of ‚ü® œÉ v ‚ü© ‚àº 4 √ó 10 ‚àí 24 similar-to delimited-‚ü®‚ü© ùúé ùë£ 4 superscript 10 24 \langle\sigma v\rangle\sim 4\times 10^{-24} ‚ü® italic_œÉ italic_v ‚ü© ‚àº 4 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 24 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 7 √ó 10 ‚àí 25 7 superscript 10 25 7\times 10^{-25} 7 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 25 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) cm 3 s ‚àí 1 superscript cm 3 superscript s 1 \mathrm{cm^{3}s^{-1}} roman_cm start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for the b b ¬Ø ùëè ¬Ø ùëè b\bar{b} italic_b over¬Ø start_ARG italic_b end_ARG ( œÑ + œÑ ‚àí superscript ùúè superscript ùúè \tau^{+}\tau^{-} italic_œÑ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œÑ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) annihilation channel in the best case scenario. Interestingly, we find the latter to be reached with no dedicated observations, as we obtain the best limits by just accumulating exposure time from all scheduled CTA programs and pointings over the first 10 years of operation. This way CTA will offer the most constraining limits from subhalo searches in the intermediate range between ‚àº 1 ‚àí 3 similar-to absent 1 3 \sim 1-3 ‚àº 1 - 3 TeV, complementing previous results with Fermi -LAT and HAWC at lower and higher energies, respectively.

One of the primary barriers is the complexity of biological materials: the geometrical, structural, and material properties vary in a wide range, and they depend on many factors. Despite these difficulties, there is a tremendous effort to develop a reliable and implementable thermal model. In the present paper, we focus on the continuum modeling of heterogeneous materials with biological origin. There are numerous examples in the literature for non-Fourier thermal models. However, as we realized, they are associated with a few common misconceptions. Therefore, we first aim to clarify the basic concepts of non-Fourier thermal models. These concepts are demonstrated by revisiting two experiments from the literature in which the Cattaneo-Vernotte and the dual phase lag models are utilized. Our investigation revealed that using these non-Fourier models is based on misinterpretations of the measured data, and the seeming deviation from Fourier‚Äôs law originates in the source terms and boundary conditions.	
 Adaptive Scheduling for Machine Learning Tasks over Networks	KonstantinosGatsis	None	None	A key functionality of emerging connected autonomous systems such as smart transportation systems, smart cities, and the industrial Internet-of-Things, is the ability to process and learn from data collected at different physical locations. This is increasingly attracting attention under the terms of distributed learning and federated learning. However, in this setup data transfer takes place over communication resources that are shared among many users and tasks or subject to capacity constraints. This paper examines algorithms for efficiently allocating resources to linear regression tasks by exploiting the informativeness of the data. The algorithms developed enable adaptive scheduling of learning tasks with reliable performance guarantees.	
 SEA-BREW: A Scalable Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme for Low-Bitrate IoT Wireless Networks	Michele La MannastarstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Pericle PerazzodaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Gianluca DinidaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is an emerging cryptographic technique that allows one to embed a fine-grained access control mechanism into encrypted data. In this paper we propose a novel ABE scheme called SEA-BREW (Scalable and Efficient Abe with Broadcast REvocation for Wireless networks), which is suited for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) applications. In contrast to state-of-the-art ABE schemes, ours is capable of securely performing key revocations with a single short broadcast message, instead of a number of unicast messages that is linear with the number of nodes. This is desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) which often are the heart of (I)IoT systems. In SEA-BREW, sensors, actuators, and users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless if they belong to the same WSAN. We formally prove that our scheme is secure also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users, under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to the complexity of the access control policies. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, which require instead a linear computational overhead.	
 Optimized effective potentials from the random-phase approximation: Accuracy of the quasiparticle approximation	Stefan Riemelmoser, Merzuk Kaltak, Georg Kresse	stefan.riemelmoser@univie.ac.at	None	The optimized effective potential (OEP) method presents an unambiguous way to construct the Kohn-Sham potential corresponding to a given diagrammatic approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. The OEP from the random-phase approximation (RPA) has played an important role ever since the conception of the OEP formalism. However, the solution of the OEP equation is computationally fairly expensive and has to be done in a self-consistent way. So far, large scale solid state applications have therefore been performed only using the quasiparticle approximation (QPA), neglecting certain dynamical screening effects. We obtain the exact RPA-OEP for 15 semiconductors and insulators by direct solution of the linearized Sham-Schl√ºter equation. We investigate the accuracy of the QPA on Kohn-Sham band gaps and dielectric constants, and comment on the issue of self-consistency.

 They See Me Rollin‚Äô: Inherent Vulnerability of the Rolling Shutter in CMOS Image Sensors	Sebastian Khler, Giulio Lovisotto, Simon Birnbach, Richard Baker, Ivan Martinovic	sebastian.kohler@cs.ox.ac.uk	None	In this paper, we describe how the electronic rolling shutter in CMOS image sensors can be exploited using a bright, modulated light source (e.g., an inexpensive, off-the-shelf laser), to inject fine-grained image disruptions. We demonstrate the attack on seven different CMOS cameras, ranging from cheap IoT to semi-professional surveillance cameras, to highlight the wide applicability of the rolling shutter attack. We model the fundamental factors affecting a rolling shutter attack in an uncontrolled setting. We then perform an exhaustive evaluation of the attack‚Äôs effect on the task of object detection, investigating the effect of attack parameters. We validate our model against empirical data collected on two separate cameras, showing that by simply using information from the camera‚Äôs datasheet the adversary can accurately predict the injected distortion size and optimize their attack accordingly. We find that an adversary can hide up to 75% of objects perceived by state-of-the-art detectors by selecting appropriate attack parameters. We also investigate the stealthiness of the attack in comparison to a na√Øve camera blinding attack, showing that common image distortion metrics can not detect the attack presence. Therefore, we present a new, accurate and lightweight enhancement to the backbone network of an object detector to recognize rolling shutter attacks. Overall, our results indicate that rolling shutter attacks can substantially reduce the performance and reliability of vision-based intelligent systems.

 A Simple Disaster-Related Knowledge Base for Intelligent Agents	Clark Emmanuel Paulo, Arvin Ken Ramirez, David Clarence ReducindoNational UniversityManila, Philippines	None	None	In this paper, we describe our efforts in establishing a simple knowledge base by building a semantic network composed of concepts and word relationships in the context of disasters in the Philippines. Our primary source of data is a collection of news articles scraped from various Philippine news websites. Using word embeddings, we extract semantically similar and co-occurring words from an initial seed words list. We arrive at an expanded ontology with a total of 450 word assertions. We let experts from the fields of linguistics, disasters, and weather science evaluate our knowledge base and arrived at an agreeability rate of 64%. We then perform a time-based analysis of the assertions to identify important semantic changes captured by the knowledge base such as the (a) trend of roles played by human entities, (b) memberships of human entities, and (c) common association of disaster-related words. The context-specific knowledge base developed from this study can be adapted by intelligent agents such as chat bots integrated in platforms such as Facebook Messenger for answering disaster-related queries.

However, the CNN models are usually computationally intensive and energy consuming, since they are often designed with numerous multiply-operations and considerable parameters for the accuracy reason. Thus, it is difficult to directly apply them in the resource-constrained environments such as ‚ÄôInternet of Things‚Äô (IoT) devices and smart phones. To reduce the computational complexity and energy burden, here we present a novel minimalist hardware architecture using adder convolutional neural network (AdderNet), in which the original convolution is replaced by adder kernel using only additions. To maximally excavate the potential energy consumption, we explore the low-bit quantization algorithm for AdderNet with shared-scaling-factor method, and we design both specific and general-purpose hardware accelerators for AdderNet. Experimental results show that the adder kernel with int8/int16 quantization also exhibits high performance, meanwhile consuming much less resources (theoretically ‚àº similar-to \mathrm{\sim} ‚àº 81% off). In addition, we deploy the quantized AdderNet on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform. The whole AdderNet can practically achieve 16% enhancement in speed, 67.6%-71.4% decrease in logic resource utilization and 47.85%-77.9% decrease in power consumption compared to CNN under the same circuit architecture. With a comprehensive comparison on the performance, power consumption, hardware resource consumption and network generalization capability, we conclude the AdderNet is able to surpass all the other competitors including the classical CNN, novel memristor-network, XNOR-Net and the shift-kernel based network, indicating its great potential in future high performance and energy-efficient artificial intelligence applications.

SpinQ Gemini aims to provide real-device experience for quantum computing education for K-12 and at the college level. It also features quantum control design capabilities that benefit the researchers studying quantum control and quantum noise. Since its first launch, SpinQ Gemini has been shipped to institutions in Canada, Taiwan and Mainland China. This paper introduces the system of design of SpinQ Gemini, from hardware to software. We also demonstrate examples for performing quantum computing tasks on SpinQ Gemini, including one task for a variational quantum eigensolver of a two-qubit Heisenberg model. The next generations of SpinQ quantum computing devices will adopt models of more qubits, advanced control functions for researchers with comparable cost, as well as simplified models for much lower cost (under 5 5 5 5 k USD) for K-12 education. We believe that low-cost portable quantum computer products will facilitate hands-on experience for teaching quantum computing at all levels, well-prepare younger generations of students and researchers for the future of quantum technologies.

 Star formation quenching stages of active and non-active galaxies	Kalinova,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Colombo, Snchez, Kodaira, GarcaBenito, Gonzlez Delgado, Rosolowsky, Lacerda	None	None	The mechanisms that bring galaxies to strongly reduce their star formation activity (star-formation quenching) is still poorly understood. To better study galaxy evolution, we propose a classification based on the maps of the ionised hydrogen distribution, traced by kpc-resolved, equivalent width of H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± maps, and the nuclear activity of the galaxies using information from the Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic diagrams. Using these tools, we group a sample of 238 galaxies from the CALIFA (Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field spectroscopy Area) survey in six quenching stages (QS): (i) objects dominated by recent star formation; (ii) systems that present a quiescent-nuclear-ring structure in their centre; (iii) galaxies that are centrally-quiescent; (iv) galaxies with no clear pattern in their ionisation gas distribution ‚àí - - mixed; (v) systems that posses only a few star-forming regions ‚àí - - nearly-retired, or (vi) galaxies that are completely quiescent ‚àí - - fully-retired. Regarding their nuclear activity, we further divide the galaxies into two groups ‚àí - - active systems that host a weak or strong Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in their centre, and non-active objects. Galaxies grouped into quenching stage classes occupy specific locations on the star-formation-rate versus stellar mass diagram. The ‚ÄúBlue cloud‚Äù is populated by the star-forming and the quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, the ‚ÄúGreen valley‚Äù is populated by centrally-quiescent and mixed systems, ‚ÄúRed sequence‚Äù by the nearly- and fully-retired objects. Generally, galaxies that host a weak or strong AGN show properties, comparable to the non-active counterparts at the same quenching stages, except for the AGN-hosting star-forming systems. The degree of the star-formation quenching increases along the present emission-line pattern sequence from star-forming to fully-retired. The proposed emission-line classes reinforce the ‚Äùinside-out‚Äù quenching scenario, which foresees that the suppression of the star-formation begins from the central regions of the galaxies.	
 Personalization Paradox in Behavior Change Apps: Lessons from a Social Comparison-Based Personalized App for Physical Activity	Jichen Zhu, Diane Dallal, Robert Gray, Jennifer Villareale, Santiago Ontan, Evan Forman, Danielle Arigo	jichen.zhu@gmail.com	None	Social comparison-based features are widely used in social computing apps. However, most existing apps are not grounded in social comparison theories and do not consider individual differences in social comparison preferences and reactions. This paper is among the first to automatically personalize social comparison targets. In the context of an m-health app for physical activity, we use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of multi-armed bandits. Results from our user study (n=53) indicate that there is some evidence that motivation can be increased using the AI-based personalization of social comparison. The detected effects achieved small-to-moderate effect sizes, illustrating the real-world implications of the intervention for enhancing motivation and physical activity. In addition to design implications for social comparison features in social apps, this paper identified the personalization paradox , the conflict between user modeling and adaptation, as a key design challenge of personalized applications for behavior change. Additionally, we propose research directions to mitigate this Personalization Paradox.	
 Galaxy Image Restoration with Shape Constraint	Fadi Nammour, Morgan Schmitz, Fred Maurice Ngol Mboula, JeanLuc Starck, Julien Girard	None	None	Images acquired with a telescope are blurred and corrupted by noise. The blurring is usually modeled by a convolution with the Point Spread Function and the noise by Additive Gaussian Noise. Recovering the observed image is an ill-posed inverse problem. Sparse deconvolution is well known to be an efficient deconvolution technique, leading to optimized pixel Mean Square Errors, but without any guarantee that the shapes of objects (e.g. galaxy images) contained in the data will be preserved. In this paper, we introduce a new shape constraint and exhibit its properties. By combining it with a standard sparse regularization in the wavelet domain, we introduce the Shape COnstraint REstoration algorithm (SCORE), which performs a standard sparse deconvolution, while preserving galaxy shapes. We show through numerical experiments that this new approach leads to a reduction of galaxy ellipticity measurement errors by at least 44%. \faGithub

 The Gel‚Äôfand‚Äôs inverse problem for the graph Laplacian	Emilia Blsten, Hiroshi Isozaki, Matti Lassas and Jinpeng Lu	None	None	We study the discrete Gel‚Äôfand‚Äôs inverse boundary spectral problem of determining a finite weighted graph. Suppose that the set of vertices of the graph is a union of two disjoint sets: X = B ‚à™ G ùëã ùêµ ùê∫ X=B\cup G italic_X = italic_B ‚à™ italic_G , where B ùêµ B italic_B is called the set of the boundary vertices and G ùê∫ G italic_G is called the set of the interior vertices. We consider the case where the vertices in the set G ùê∫ G italic_G and the edges connecting them are unknown. Assume that we are given the set B ùêµ B italic_B and the pairs ( Œª j , œï j | B ) subscript ùúÜ ùëó evaluated-at subscript italic-œï ùëó ùêµ (\lambda_{j},\phi_{j}|_{B}) ( italic_Œª start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , where Œª j subscript ùúÜ ùëó \lambda_{j} italic_Œª start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian and œï j | B evaluated-at subscript italic-œï ùëó ùêµ \phi_{j}|_{B} italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the values of the corresponding eigenfunctions at the vertices in B ùêµ B italic_B . We show that the graph structure, namely the unknown vertices in G ùê∫ G italic_G and the edges connecting them, along with the weights, can be uniquely determined from the given data, if every boundary vertex is connected to only one interior vertex and the graph satisfies the following property: any subset S ‚äÜ G ùëÜ ùê∫ S\subseteq G italic_S ‚äÜ italic_G of cardinality | S | ‚©æ 2 ùëÜ 2 |S|\geqslant 2 | italic_S | ‚©æ 2 contains two extreme points.

 1 Introduction			None	Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an effective approach to learning representation in a range of downstream tasks. Central to this approach is the selection of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) sets to provide the model the opportunity to ‚Äòcontrast‚Äô between data and class representation in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate CL for improving model robustness using adversarial samples. We first designed and performed a comprehensive study to understand how adversarial vulnerability behaves in the latent space. Based on this empirical evidence, we propose an effective and efficient supervised contrastive learning to achieve model robustness against adversarial attacks. Moreover, we propose a new sample selection strategy that optimizes the positive/negative sets by removing redundancy and improving correlation with the anchor. Extensive experiments show that our Adversarial Supervised Contrastive Learning (ASCL) approach achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art defenses while significantly outperforms other CL-based defense methods by using only 42.8 % percent 42.8 42.8\% 42.8 % positives and 6.3 % percent 6.3 6.3\% 6.3 % negatives.	
 Correctable Erasure Patterns in Product Topologies	Lukas Holzbaur,Sven Puchinger,Eitan Yaakobi,and Antonia WachterZeh	None	None	Locality enables storage systems to recover failed nodes from small subsets of surviving nodes. The setting where nodes are partitioned into subsets, each allowing for local recovery, is well understood. In this work we consider a generalization introduced by Gopalan et al., where, viewing the codewords as arrays, constraints are imposed on the columns and rows in addition to some global constraints. Specifically, we present a generic method of adding such global parity-checks and derive new results on the set of correctable erasure patterns. Finally, we relate the set of correctable erasure patterns in the considered topology to those correctable in tensor-product codes.

The resonant energy, width and residues are determined by expanding the observable as a sum of resonant-pole pairs under an appropriate parameterization which expresses the observable to be single-valued , and fitting it to experimental data of the invariant-mass distribution of œÄ + Œ£ ‚àí superscript ùúã superscript Œ£ \pi^{+}\Sigma^{-} italic_œÄ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , œÄ ‚àí Œ£ + superscript ùúã superscript Œ£ \pi^{-}\Sigma^{+} italic_œÄ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , œÄ 0 Œ£ 0 superscript ùúã 0 superscript Œ£ 0 \pi^{0}\Sigma^{0} italic_œÄ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT final states in the reaction, Œ≥ p ‚Üí K + œÄ Œ£ ‚Üí ùõæ ùëù superscript ùêæ ùúã Œ£ \gamma p\rightarrow K^{+}\pi\Sigma italic_Œ≥ italic_p ‚Üí italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œÄ roman_Œ£ , and the elastic and inelastic cross section, K ‚àí p ‚Üí K ‚àí p ‚Üí superscript ùêæ ùëù superscript ùêæ ùëù K^{-}p\to K^{-}p italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p ‚Üí italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p , K ¬Ø 0 n superscript ¬Ø ùêæ 0 ùëõ \bar{K}^{0}n over¬Ø start_ARG italic_K end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n , œÄ + Œ£ ‚àí superscript ùúã superscript Œ£ \pi^{+}\Sigma^{-} italic_œÄ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , œÄ ‚àí Œ£ + superscript ùúã superscript Œ£ \pi^{-}\Sigma^{+} italic_œÄ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . As we gradually increase the number of pairs from one to three, the first pair converges while the second and third pairs emerge further and further away from the first pair, implying that the Uniformized Mittag-Leffler expansion with three pairs is almost convergent in the vicinity of the Œõ ( 1405 ) Œõ 1405 \Lambda(1405) roman_Œõ ( 1405 ) .

We conclude that the Uniformized Mittag-Leffler expansion turns out to be a very powerful method to obtain resonance energy, width and residues from the near-threshold spectrum .	
 Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning		None	None	Anomaly detection with weakly supervised video-level labels is typically formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, in which we aim to identify snippets containing abnormal events, with each video represented as a bag of video snippets. Although current methods show effective detection performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method, named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances, substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.	
 Contents			None	We propose a novel codimension-n holography, called cone holography, between a gravitational theory in ( d + 1 ) ùëë 1 (d+1) ( italic_d + 1 ) -dimensional conical spacetime and a CFT on the ( d + 1 ‚àí n ) ùëë 1 ùëõ (d+1-n) ( italic_d + 1 - italic_n ) -dimensional defects. Similar to wedge holography, the cone holography can be obtained by taking the zero-volume limit of holographic defect CFT. Remarkably, it can be regarded as a holographic dual of the edge modes on the defects. For one class of solutions, we prove that the cone holography is equivalent to AdS/CFT, by showing that the classical gravitational action and thus the CFT partition function in large N limit are the same for the two theories. In general, cone holography and AdS/CFT are different due to the infinite towers of massive Kaluza-Klein modes on the branes. We test cone holography by studying Weyl anomaly, Entanglement/R√©nyi entropy and correlation functions, and find good agreements between the holographic and the CFT results. In particular, the c-theorem is obeyed by cone holography. These are strong supports for our proposal. We discuss two kinds of boundary conditions, the mixed boundary condition and Neumann boundary condition, and find that they both define a consistent theory of cone holography. We also analyze the mass spectrum on the brane and find that the larger the tension is, the more continuous the mass spectrum is. The cone holography can be regarded as a generalization of the wedge holography, and it is closely related to the defect CFT, entanglement/R√©nyi entropy and AdS/BCFT(dCFT). Thus it is expected to have a wide range of applications.	
 Computational Workflows for Designing Input Devices	YiChi Liao	yi-chi.liao@aalto.fi	None	Input devices, such as buttons and sliders, are the foundation of any interface. The typical user-centered design workflow requires the developers and users to go through many iterations of design, implementation, and analysis. The procedure is inefficient, and human decisions highly bias the results. While computational methods are used to assist various design tasks, there has not been any holistic approach to automate the design of input components. My thesis proposed a series of Computational Input Design workflows: I envision a sample-efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm that cleverly selects design instances, which are instantly deployed on physical simulators. A meta-reinforcement learning user model then simulates the user behaviors when using the design instance upon the simulators. The new workflows derive Pareto-optimal designs with high efficiency and automation. I demonstrate designing a push-button via the proposed methods. The resulting designs outperform the known baselines. The Computational Input Design process can be generalized to other devices, such as joystick, touchscreen, mouse, controller, etc.	
 Embedding-based Instance Segmentation in Microscopy	Manan Lalit, Pavel Tomancak, Florian Jug	None	None	Automatic detection and segmentation of objects in 2D and 3D microscopy data is important for countless biomedical applications. In the natural image domain, spatial embedding-based instance segmentation methods are known to yield high-quality results, but their utility for segmenting microscopy data is currently little researched. Here we introduce EmbedSeg , an embedding-based instance segmentation method which outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on 2D as well as 3D microscopy datasets. Additionally, we show that EmbedSeg has a GPU memory footprint small enough to train even on laptop GPUs, making it accessible to virtually everyone. Finally, we introduce four new 3D microscopy datasets, which we make publicly available alongside ground truth training labels. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/juglab/EmbedSeg .

 Facilitating Terminology Translation with Target Lemma Annotations	Toms BergmanisabsentdaggerddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Mrcis PinnisabsentdaggerddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTTilde Vienbas gatve A, Riga, LatviaddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTFaculty of Computing, University of Latvia Raia bulv , Riga, Latvia	None	None	Most of the recent work on terminology integration in machine translation has assumed that terminology translations are given already inflected in forms that are suitable for the target language sentence. In day-to-day work of professional translators, however, it is seldom the case as translators work with bilingual glossaries where terms are given in their dictionary forms; finding the right target language form is part of the translation process. We argue that the requirement for apriori specified target language forms is unrealistic and impedes the practical applicability of previous work. In this work, we propose to train machine translation systems using a source-side data augmentation method 1 1 1 Relevant materials and code: https://github.com/tilde-nlp/terminology_translation that annotates randomly selected source language words with their target language lemmas. We show that systems trained on such augmented data are readily usable for terminology integration in real-life translation scenarios. Our experiments on terminology translation into the morphologically complex Baltic and Uralic languages show an improvement of up to 7 BLEU points over baseline systems with no means for terminology integration and an average improvement of 4 BLEU points over the previous work. Results of the human evaluation indicate a 47.7% absolute improvement over the previous work in term translation accuracy when translating into Latvian.	
 Dilatancy stabilises shear failure in rock	Franciscus Aben,Nicolas BrantutDepartment of Earth SciencesUniversity College London, UK	None	None	Failure and fault slip in crystalline rocks is associated with dilation. When pore fluids are present and drainage is insufficient, dilation leads to pore pressure drops, which in turn lead to strengthening of the material. We conducted laboratory rock fracture experiments with direct in-situ fluid pressure measurements which demonstrate that dynamic rupture propagation and fault slip can be stabilised (i.e., become quasi-static) by such a dilatancy strengthening effect. We also observe that, for the same effective pressures but lower pore fluid pressures, the stabilisation process may be arrested when the pore fluid pressure approaches zero and vaporises, resulting in dynamic shear failure. In case of a stable rupture, we witness continued prolonged slip after the main failure event that is the result of pore pressure recharge of the fault zone. All our observations are quantitatively explained by a spring-slider model combining slip-weakening behaviour, slip-induced dilation, and pore fluid diffusion. Using our data in an inverse problem, we estimate the key parameters controlling rupture stabilisation, fault dilation rate and fault zone storage. These estimates are used to make predictions for the pore pressure drop associated with faulting, and where in the crust we may expect dilatancy stabilisation or vaporisation during earthquakes. For intact rock and well consolidated faults, we expect strong dilatancy strengthening between 4 and 6 km depth regardless of ambient pore pressure, and at greater depths when the ambient pore pressure approaches lithostatic pressure. In the uppermost part of the crust ( < 4 absent 4 <4 < 4 km), we predict vaporisation of pore fluids that limits dilatancy strengthening. The depth estimates where dilatant stabilisation is most likely coincide with geothermal energy reservoirs in crystalline rock (typically between 2 and 5 km depth) and in regions where slow slip events are observed (pore pressure that approaches lithostatic pressure).	
 Optimizing Convergence for Iterative Learning of ARIMA for Stationary Time Series	Kevin StypRekowski, Florian Schmidt, Odej Kao	None	None	Forecasting of time series in continuous systems becomes an increasingly relevant task due to recent developments in IoT and 5G. The popular forecasting model ARIMA is applied to a large variety of applications for decades. An online variant of ARIMA applies the Online Newton Step in order to learn the underlying process of the time series. This optimization method has pitfalls concerning the computational complexity and convergence. Thus, this work focuses on the computational less expensive Online Gradient Descent optimization method, which became popular for learning of neural networks in recent years. For the iterative training of such models, we propose a new approach combining different Online Gradient Descent learners (such as Adam, AMSGrad, Adagrad, Nesterov) to achieve fast convergence. The evaluation on synthetic data and experimental datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods resulting in an overall lower prediction error.	
 SpanEmo: Casting Multi-label Emotion Classification as Span-prediction	Hassan Alhuzali Sophia AnaniadouNational Centre for Text MiningDepartment of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom	None	None	Emotion recognition ( er ) is an important task in Natural Language Processing ( nlp ), due to its high impact in real-world applications from health and well-being to author profiling, consumer analysis and security. Current approaches to er , mainly classify emotions independently without considering that emotions can co-exist. Such approaches overlook potential ambiguities, in which multiple emotions overlap. We propose a new model ‚ÄúSpanEmo‚Äù casting multi-label emotion classification as span-prediction, which can aid er models to learn associations between labels and words in a sentence. Furthermore, we introduce a loss function focused on modelling multiple co-existing emotions in the input sentence. Experiments performed on the SemEval2018 multi-label emotion data over three language sets (i.e., English, Arabic and Spanish) demonstrate our method‚Äôs effectiveness. Finally, we present different analyses that illustrate the benefits of our method in terms of improving the model performance and learning meaningful associations between emotion classes and words in the sentence 1 1 1 Source code is available at https://github.com/hasanhuz/SpanEmo .	
 Latent Factor Modeling of Users Subjective Perception for Stereoscopic 3D Video Recommendation	BalasubramanyamAppinastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,,,MansiSharmastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,,,SantoshKumarstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Numerous stereoscopic 3D movies are released every year to theaters and created large revenues. Despite the improvement in stereo capturing and 3D video post-production technology, stereoscopic artifacts which cause viewer discomfort continue to appear even in high-budget films. Existing automatic 3D video quality measurement tools can detect distortions in stereoscopic images or videos, but they fail to consider the viewer‚Äôs subjective perception of those artifacts, and how these distortions affect their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation system for stereoscopic 3D movies based on a latent factor model that meticulously analyse the viewer‚Äôs subjective ratings and influence of 3D video distortions on their preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind model that recommends 3D movies based on stereo-film-quality ratings accounting correlation between the viewer‚Äôs visual discomfort and stereoscopic-artifact perception. The proposed model is trained and tested on benchmark Nama3ds1-cospad1 and LFOVIAS3DPh2 S3D video quality assessment datasets. The experiments revealed that resulting matrix-factorization based recommendation system is able to generalize considerably better for the viewer‚Äôs subjective ratings.

 Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Wind Speed Prediction	Tomasz StaczykaastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Siamak Mehrkanoona,a,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	t.stanczyk@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl	aùëé{}^{a}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_a end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering, Maastricht University, The Netherlands	Wind speed prediction and forecasting is important for various business and management sectors. In this paper, we introduce new models for wind speed prediction based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Given hourly data of several weather variables acquired from multiple weather stations, wind speed values are predicted for multiple time steps ahead. In particular, the weather stations are treated as nodes of a graph whose associated adjacency matrix is learnable. In this way, the network learns the graph spatial structure and determines the strength of relations between the weather stations based on the historical weather data. We add a self-loop connection to the learnt adjacency matrix and normalize the adjacency matrix. We examine two scenarios with the self-loop connection setting (two separate models). In the first scenario, the self-loop connection is imposed as a constant additive. In the second scenario a learnable parameter is included to enable the network to decide about the self-loop connection strength. Furthermore, we incorporate data from multiple time steps with temporal convolution, which together with spatial graph convolution constitutes spatio-temporal graph convolution. We perform experiments on real datasets collected from weather stations located in cities in Denmark and the Netherlands. The numerical experiments show that our proposed models outperform previously developed baseline models on the referenced datasets. We provide additional insights by visualizing learnt adjacency matrices from each layer of our models.	
 Continuity of weak solutions to a class of doubly nonlinear parabolic nonlocal ùëù-Laplace equation	Agnid Banerjee, Prashanta Garain and Juha Kinnunen, Agnid Banerjee, Prashanta Garain and Juha Kinnunen	None	None	We discuss pointwise behavior of weak supersolutions for a class of doubly nonlinear parabolic fractional p ùëù p italic_p -Laplace equations which includes the fractional parabolic p ùëù p italic_p -Laplace equation and the fractional porous medium equation. More precisely, we show that weak supersolutions have lower semicontinuous representative. We also prove that the semicontinuous representative at an instant of time is determined by the values at previous times. This gives a pointwise interpretation for a weak supersolution at every point. The corresponding results hold true also for weak subsolutions. Our results extend some recent results in the local parabolic case and in the nonlocal elliptic case to the nonlocal parabolic case. We prove the required energy estimates and measure theoretic De Giorgi type lemmas in the fractional setting.	
 Deep One-Class Classification via Interpolated Gaussian Descriptor	Yuanhong Chen,Yu Tian,Guansong Pang, andGustavo Carneiro	None	None	One-class classification (OCC) aims to learn an effective data description to enclose all normal training samples and detect anomalies based on the deviation from the data description. Current state-of-the-art OCC models learn a compact normality description by hyper-sphere minimisation, but they often suffer from overfitting the training data, especially when the training set is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. To address this issue, we introduce the interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD) method, a novel OCC model that learns a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. The Gaussian anomaly classifier differentiates the training samples based on their distance to the Gaussian centre and the standard deviation of these distances, offering the model a discriminability w.r.t. the given samples during training. The adversarial interpolation is enforced to consistently learn a smooth Gaussian descriptor, even when the training data is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. This enables our model to learn the data description based on the representative normal samples rather than fringe or anomalous samples, resulting in significantly improved normality description. In extensive experiments on diverse popular benchmarks, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, MVTec AD and two medical datasets, IGD achieves better detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art models. IGD also shows better robustness in problems with small or contaminated training sets.	
 Cross-lingual Visual Pre-training for Multimodal Machine Translation	Ozan CaglayanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Menekse KuyustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Mustafa Sercan AmacstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Pranava MadhyasthastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Imperial College LondonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Hacettepe UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Ko UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversity of SheffieldstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,ADAPT Dublin City UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Pre-trained language models have been shown to improve performance in many natural language tasks substantially. Although the early focus of such models was single language pre-training, recent advances have resulted in cross-lingual and visual pre-training methods. In this paper, we combine these two approaches to learn visually-grounded cross-lingual representations. Specifically, we extend the translation language modelling Lample and Conneau ( 2019 ) with masked region classification and perform pre-training with three-way parallel vision & language corpora. We show that when fine-tuned for multimodal machine translation, these models obtain state-of-the-art performance. We also provide qualitative insights into the usefulness of the learned grounded representations.	
 In-situ electric field control of THz non-reciprocal directional dichroism in the multiferroic Ba‚ÇÇCoGe‚ÇÇO‚Çá	Vt, Viirok, Peedu, Rm, Nagel, Kocsis, Tokunaga, Taguchi, Tokura, Kzsmrki, Balla, Penc, Romhnyi, Bordcs	None	None	Non-reciprocal directional dichroism, also called the optical-diode effect, is an appealing functional property inherent to the large class of non-centrosymmetric magnets. However, the in-situ electric control of this phenomenon is challenging as it requires a set of conditions to be fulfilled: Special symmetries of the magnetic ground state, spin-excitations with comparable magnetic- and electric-dipole activity and switchable electric polarization. We demonstrate the isothermal electric switch between domains of Ba 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT CoGe 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O 7 7 {}_{7} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 7 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT possessing opposite magnetoelectric susceptibilities.

 Bivariate asymptotics for eta-theta quotients with simple poles	Giulia Cesana, Joshua Males	None	University of Cologne, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Division of Mathematics, Weyertal 86-90, 50931 Cologne, Germany	We employ a variant of Wright‚Äôs circle method to determine the bivariate asymptotic behaviour of Fourier coefficients for a wide class of eta-theta quotients with simple poles in ‚Ñç ‚Ñç \mathbb{H} blackboard_H .	
 On a new formulation for energy transfer between convection and fast tides with application to giant planets and solar type stars	Caroline TerquemDepartment of Physics, Oxford University, Keble Road, Oxford OX RH, UKInstitut dAstrophysique de Paris, Sorbonne Universit, CNRS,UMR , bis boulevard Arago, F, Paris, France	None	None	All the studies of the interaction between tides and a convective flow assume that the large scale tides can be described as a mean shear flow which is damped by small scale fluctuating convective eddies. The convective Reynolds stress is calculated using mixing length theory, accounting for a sharp suppression of dissipation when the turnover timescale is larger than the tidal period. This yields tidal dissipation rates several orders of magnitude too small to account for the circularization periods of late‚Äìtype binaries or the tidal dissipation factor of giant planets. Here, we argue that the above description is inconsistent, because fluctuations and mean flow should be identified based on the timescale, not on the spatial scale, on which they vary. Therefore, the standard picture should be reversed, with the fluctuations being the tidal oscillations and the mean shear flow provided by the largest convective eddies. We assume that energy is locally transferred from the tides to the convective flow. Using this assumption, we obtain values for the tidal Q ùëÑ Q italic_Q factor of Jupiter and Saturn and for the circularization periods of PMS binaries in good agreement with observations. The timescales obtained with the equilibrium tide approximation are however still 40 times too large to account for the circularization periods of late‚Äìtype binaries. For these systems, shear in the tachocline or at the base of the convective zone may be the main cause of tidal dissipation.

 Optimal control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin ensemble in diamond for sensing in the pulsed domain	Andreas FL Poulsen, Joshua Clement, James Webb, Rasmus Jensen, Kirstine BergSrensen, Alexander Huck, Ulrik Lund Andersen	None	None	Defects in solid state materials provide an ideal, robust platform for quantum sensing. To deliver maximum sensitivity, a large ensemble of non-interacting defects hosting coherent quantum states are required. Control of such an ensemble is challenging due to the spatial variation in both the defect energy levels and in any control field across a macroscopic sample. In this work we experimentally demonstrate that we can overcome these challenges using Floquet theory and optimal control optimization methods to efficiently and coherently control a large defect ensemble, suitable for sensing. We apply our methods experimentally to a spin ensemble of up to 4 √ó \times √ó 10 9 9 {}^{9} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. By considering the physics of the system and explicitly including the hyperfine interaction in the optimization, we design shaped microwave control pulses that can outperform conventional ( œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ -) pulses when applied to sensing of temperature or magnetic field, with a potential sensitivity improvement between 11 and 78%. Through dynamical modelling of the behaviour of the ensemble, we shed light on the physical behaviour of the ensemble system and propose new routes for further improvement.

Network data is, implicitly or explicitly, always represented using a graph shift operator (GSO) with the most common choices being the adjacency, Laplacian matrices and their normalisations. In this paper, a novel parametrised GSO (PGSO) is proposed, where specific parameter values result in the most commonly used GSOs and message-passing operators in graph neural network (GNN) frameworks. The PGSO is suggested as a replacement of the standard GSOs that are used in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included in the model training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real eigenvectors independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the PGSO are derived. PGSO parameters are shown to adapt to the sparsity of the graph structure in a study on stochastic blockmodel networks, where they are found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the literature. On several real-world datasets the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN architectures is improved by the inclusion of the PGSO in both node- and graph-classification tasks.	
 Entropic force between two horizons of dilaton black holes with a power-Maxwell field	HuiHua ZhaostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, LiChun ZhangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ying GaostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Fang LiustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this paper, we consider ( n + 1 ) ùëõ 1 (n+1) ( italic_n + 1 ) -dimensional topological dilaton de Sitter black holes with power-Maxwell field as thermodynamic systems. The thermodynamic quantities corresponding to the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon respectively are interrelated. So the total entropy of the space-time should be the sum of the entropies of the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon plus a corrected term which is produced by the association of the two horizons. We analyze the entropic force produced by the corrected term at given temperatures, which is affected by parameters and dimensions of the space-time. It is shown that the change of entropic force with the position ratio of two horizons in some region is similar to that of Lennard-Jones force with the position of particles. If the effect of entropic force is similar to that of Lennard-Jones force, and other forces are absent, the motion of the cosmological horizon relative to the black hole horizon would have an oscillating process. The entropic force between the two horizons is probably one of the participants to drive the evolution of universe.	
 CutFEM Based on Extended Finite Element Spaces	Erik Burman,Peter Hansbo,Mats Larson	None	None	We develop a general framework for construction and analysis of discrete extension operators with application to unfitted finite element approximation of partial differential equations. In unfitted methods so called cut elements intersected by the boundary occur and these elements must in general by stabilized in some way. Discrete extension operators provides such a stabilization by modification of the finite element space close to the boundary. More, precisely the finite element space is extended from the stable interior elements over the boundary in a stable way which also guarantees optimal approximation properties. Our framework is applicable to all standard nodal based finite elements of various order and regularity. We develop an abstract theory for elliptic problems and associated parabolic time dependent partial differential equations and derive a priori error estimates. We finally apply this to some examples of partial differential equations of different order including the interface problems, the biharmonic operator and the sixth order triharmonic operator.

We prove, by constructing sub- and super-solutions, that the approximations are accurate to the specified order. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments to illustrate the effect that stochastic trading frictions have on optimal trading.

 Localization in the Kicked Ising Chain	Daniel Waltner, Petr Braun	None	None	Determining the border between ergodic and localized behavior is of central interest for interacting many-body systems. We consider here the recently very popular spin-chain model that is periodically excited. A convenient description of such a many-body system is achieved by the dual operator that evolves the system in contrast to the time-evolution operator not in time but in particle direction. We identify in this paper the largest eigenvalue of a function based on the dual operator as a convenient tool to determine if the system shows ergodic or many-body localized features. By perturbation theory in the vicinity of the noninteracting system we explain analytically the eigenvalue structure and compare it with numerics in [P. Braun, D. Waltner, M. Akila, B. Gutkin, T. Guhr, Phys. Rev. E 101 , 052201 (2020)] for small times. Furthermore we identify a quantity that allows based on extensive large-time numerical computations of the spectral form factor to distinguish between localized and ergodic system features and to determine the Thouless time, i.e. the transition time between these regimes in the thermodynamic limit.	
 The EM Perspective of Directional Mean Shift Algorithm	Yikun ZhangyikunuweduYenChi ChenyenchicuweduUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WA	None	None	The directional mean shift (DMS) algorithm is a nonparametric method for pursuing local modes of densities defined by kernel density estimators on the unit hypersphere. In this paper, we show that any DMS iteration can be viewed as a generalized Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm; in particular, when the von Mises kernel is applied, it becomes an exact EM algorithm. Under the (generalized) EM framework, we provide a new proof for the ascending property of density estimates and demonstrate the global convergence of directional mean shift sequences. Finally, we give a new insight into the linear convergence of the DMS algorithm.	
 Membranes with thin and heavy inclusions: asymptotics of spectra	Yuriy Golovaty	None	Dept. of Mechanics and Mathematics, Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, Universytetska str.1, Lviv, 79000, Ukraine	We study the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues of 2D vibrating systems with mass density perturbed in a vicinity of closed curves. The threshold case in which the resonance frequencies of the membrane and the frequencies of thin inclusion coincide is investigated. The perturbed eigenvalue problem can be realized as a family of self-adjoint operators acting on varying Hilbert spaces. However the so-called limit operator is non-self-adjoint and possesses the Jordan chains of length 2 2 2 2 . Apart from the lack of self-adjointness, the operator has non-compact resolvent. As a consequence, its spectrum has a complicated structure, for instance, the spectrum contains a countable set of eigenvalues with infinite multiplicity. The complete asymptotic analysis of eigenvalues has been carried out.	
 A Continuation Method for Large-Scale Modeling and Control: from ODEs to PDE, a Round Trip	DenisNikitin,Carlos CanudasdeWitandPaoloFrasca	None	None	In this paper we present a continuation method which transforms spatially distributed ODE systems into continuous PDE. We show that this continuation can be performed both for linear and nonlinear systems, including multidimensional, space- and time-varying systems. When applied to a large-scale network, the continuation provides a PDE describing evolution of continuous state approximation that respects the spatial structure of the original ODE. Our method is illustrated by multiple examples including transport equations, Kuramoto equations and heat diffusion equations. As a main example, we perform the continuation of a Newtonian system of interacting particles and obtain the Euler equations for compressible fluids, thereby providing an original alternative solution to Hilbert‚Äôs 6th problem. Finally, we leverage our derivation of the Euler equations to control multiagent systems, designing a nonlinear control algorithm for robot formation based on its continuous approximation.

 Few-Shot Website Fingerprinting Attack	MantunChen,YongjunWang,ZhiquanQinandXiatianZhu	None	None	This work introduces a novel data augmentation method for few-shot website fingerprinting (WF) attack where only a handful of training samples per website are available for deep learning model optimization. Moving beyond earlier WF methods relying on manually-engineered feature representations, more advanced deep learning alternatives demonstrate that learning feature representations automatically from training data is superior. Nonetheless, this advantage is subject to an unrealistic assumption that there exist many training samples per website, which otherwise will disappear. To address this, we introduce a model-agnostic, efficient, and Harmonious Data Augmentation (HDA) method that can improve deep WF attacking methods significantly. HDA involves both intra-sample and inter-sample data transformations that can be used in harmonious manner to expand a tiny training dataset to an arbitrarily large collection, therefore effectively and explicitly addressing the intrinsic data scarcity problem. We conducted expensive experiments to validate our HDA for boosting state-of-the-art deep learning WF attack models in both closed-world and open-world attacking scenarios, at absence and presence of strong defense. For instance, in the more challenging and realistic evaluation scenario with WTF-PAD based defense, our HDA method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art results by more than 4% in absolute classification accuracy in the 20-shot learning case.

 Full-Duplex Reflective Beamsteering Metasurface Featuring Magnetless Nonreciprocal Amplification	Sajjad TaravatistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand George EleftheriadesstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Nonreciprocal radiation refers to electromagnetic wave radiation in which a structure provides different responses under the change of the direction of the incident field. Modern wireless telecommunication systems demand versatile apparatuses which are capable of full-duplex nonreciprocal wave processing and amplification, especially in the reflective state. To realize such a unique, extraordinary and versatile functionality, we propose an architecture in which a chain of series cascaded radiating patches are integrated with nonreciprocal phase shifters, providing an original and efficient apparatus for full-duplex reflective beamsteering. Such an ultrathin reflective metasurface can provide directive and diverse radiation beams, large wave amplification, steerable beams by simply changing the bias of the gradient active nonmagnetic nonreciprocal phase shifters, and is immune to undesired time harmonics. Having accomplished all these functionalities in the reflective state, the metasurface represents a conspicuous apparatus for efficient, controllable and programmable wave engineering.	
 Dispersion and Filtering Properties of Rectangular Waveguides Loaded with Holey Structures	ngel PalomaresCaballero, Antonio AlexAmor, Pablo Padilla, and Juan ValenzuelaValds	None	None	This paper analyzes thoroughly the dispersion and filtering features of periodic holey waveguides in the millimeter-wave frequency range. Two structures are mainly studied depending on the glide and mirror symmetries of the holes. A parametric study of the dispersion characteristics of their unit cells is carried out. Glide-symmetric holey waveguides provide a higher propagation constant and a low dispersion over a wide frequency range regarding hollow waveguides. This property is particularly useful for the design of low-loss and low-dispersive phase shifters. We also demonstrate that glide-symmetric holey waveguides are less dispersive than waveguides loaded with glide-symmetric pins. Furthermore, we perform a Bloch analysis to compute the attenuation constants in holey waveguides with mirror and broken glide symmetries. Both configurations are demonstrated to be suitable for filter design. Finally, the simulation results are validated with two prototypes in gap-waveguide technology. The first one is a 180 o phase shifter based on a glide-symmetric holey configuration that achieves a flat phase shift response over a wide frequency range (27.5% frequency bandwidth). The second one is a filter based on a mirror-symmetric holey structure with 20-dB rejection from 63 GHz to 75 GHz.	
 Navigating the pitfalls of relic neutrino detection	Yevheniia Cheipesh, Vadim Cheianov, Alexey Boyarsky	gene.cheypesh@gmail.com	None	Beta-spectrum of radioactive atoms was long ago predicted to bear an imprint of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ B) Weinberg ( 1962 ) . Over the years, it has been recognised that the best chance of achieving the signal-to-noise ratio required for the observation of this effect lies with solid-state designs Baracchini et al.

Although progresses have been achieved, existing methods are heuristically motivated and theoretical understanding of such embeddings is comparatively underdeveloped. This paper extends the random walk model Arora et al. ( 2016a ) of word embeddings to Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to derive a scoring function that evaluates the strength of a relation R ùëÖ R italic_R between two entities h ‚Ñé h italic_h (head) and t ùë° t italic_t (tail). Moreover, we show that marginal loss minimisation, a popular objective used in much prior work in KGE, follows naturally from the log-likelihood ratio maximisation under the probabilities estimated from the KGEs according to our theoretical relationship. We propose a learning objective motivated by the theoretical analysis to learn KGEs from a given knowledge graph. Using the derived objective, accurate KGEs are learnt from FB15K237 and WN18RR benchmark datasets, providing empirical evidence in support of the theory.	
 Joint Active and Passive Beamforming for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Multiuser MIMO Communications	Xingyu Zhao, Tian Lin, and Yu Zhu	None	None	This letter investigates the joint active and passive beamforming optimization for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum-rate. We show that this problem can be solved via a matrix weighted mean square error minimization equivalence. In particular, for the optimization of the passive IRS beamforming, we first propose an iterative algorithm with excellent performance based on manifold optimization. By using fractional programming to obtain a more tractable object function, we then propose a low complexity algorithm based on majorization-minimization. Numerical results verify the convergence of our proposed algorithms and the significant performance improvement over the communication scenario without IRS assistance.	
 Agents.jl: A performant and feature-full agent based modelling software of minimal code complexity	George Datseris, Ali RVahdatiand Timothy CDuBois	None	None	Agent based modelling is a simulation method in which autonomous agents interact with their environment and one another, given a predefined set of rules. It is an integral method for modelling and simulating complex systems, such as socio-economic problems. Since agent based models are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an ABM analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular ABM software in other programming languages. We find that Agents.jl is not only the most performant, but also the least complicated software, providing the same (and sometimes more) features as the competitors with less input required from the user. Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and more. This removes any ‚Äúextensions library‚Äù requirement from Agents.jl, which is paramount in many other tools.

 Personalized Education in the AI Era: What to Expect Next?	Setareh Maghsudi, Andrew Lan, Jie Xu, and Mihaela van der Schaar	None	None	The objective of personalized learning is to design an effective knowledge acquisition track that matches the learner‚Äôs strengths and bypasses her weaknesses to ultimately meet her desired goal. This concept emerged several years ago and is being adopted by a rapidly-growing number of educational institutions around the globe. In recent years, the boost of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), together with the advances in big data analysis, has unfolded novel perspectives to enhance personalized education in numerous dimensions. By taking advantage of AI/ML methods, the educational platform precisely acquires the student‚Äôs characteristics. This is done, in part, by observing the past experiences as well as analyzing the available big data through exploring the learners‚Äô features and similarities. It can, for example, recommend the most appropriate content among numerous accessible ones, advise a well-designed long-term curriculum, connect appropriate learners by suggestion, accurate performance evaluation, and the like. Still, several aspects of AI-based personalized education remain unexplored. These include, among others, compensating for the adverse effects of the absence of peers, creating and maintaining motivations for learning, increasing the diversity, removing the biases induced by the data and algorithms, and the like. In this paper, while providing a brief review of state-of-the-art research, we investigate the challenges of AI/ML-based personalized education, and discuss potential solutions.	
 Camera Invariant Feature Learning for Generalized Face Anti-spoofing	Baoliang Chen, Wenhan Yang,,Haoliang Li,Shiqi Wang,, and Sam Kwong	None	None	There has been an increasing consensus in learning based face anti-spoofing that the divergence in terms of camera models is causing a large domain gap in real application scenarios. We describe a framework that eliminates the influence of inherent variance from acquisition cameras at the feature level, leading to the generalized face spoofing detection model that could be highly adaptive to different acquisition devices. In particular, the framework is composed of two branches. The first branch aims to learn the camera invariant spoofing features via feature level decomposition in the high frequency domain. Motivated by the fact that the spoofing features exist not only in the high frequency domain, in the second branch the discrimination capability of extracted spoofing features is further boosted from the enhanced image based on the recomposition of the high-frequency and low-frequency information. Finally, the classification results of the two branches are fused together by a weighting strategy. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve better performance in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings, demonstrating the high generalization capability in various application scenarios.	
 Optically induced nonreciprocity by a plasmonic pump in semiconductor wires	KilSong Song, SongJin Im, JiSong Pae, CholSong Ri, KumSong Ho, CholSun Kim, YongHa Han	None	None	In most studies on all-optical diodes spatial asymmetry has been by necessity applied to break Lorentz reciprocity. Here we suggest a paradigm for optically induced nonreciprocity in semiconductor wires which are spatially asymmetry-free and provide a very simple and efficient platform for plasmonic devices. An azimuthal magnetic field induced by a plasmonic pump in the semiconductor wire alters the material parameters and thus results in a cross-nonlinear modulation of the plasmonic signal. Peculiarly the nonlinear wavenumber shift has opposite signs for forward and backward signals whereas Kerr or Kerr-like nonlinearity does not break Lorentz reciprocity in spatially symmetric structures. This principle may open an avenue towards highly integrated all-optical nonreciprocal devices.

A previous, prototype implementation of MTA proved the value of the concept, but was neither suitable for use at scale nor easily extensible; MTA2 is a complete reimplementation of the system that overcomes these hurdles. MTA2 serves two, interconnected purposes: facilitating practical peer grading and serving as a testbed for experimentation with different peer grading mechanisms. The system is characterized by a modular design that makes customization easy; support for dividing students into different pools based on their peer-grading prowess; mechanisms for automated calibration and spot checking; and the ability for students to appeal grades and to give feedback about individual reviews.

 Selection, recombination, and the ancestral initiation graph	Frederic Alberti, Carolin Herrmann, and Ellen Baake	{falberti,ebaake}@math.uni-bielefeld.de	"{Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty of Technology}, Bielefeld University,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Postbox 100131, 33501 Bielefeld, Germany"	Recently, the selection-recombination equation with a single selected site and an arbitrary number of neutral sites was solved by Alberti and Baake ( 2021 ) by means of the ancestral selection-recombination graph. Here, we introduce a more accessible approach, namely the ancestral initiation graph. The construction is based on a discretisation of the selection-recombination equation. We apply our method to systematically explain a long-standing observation concerning the dynamics of linkage disequilibrium between two neutral loci hitchhiking along with a selected one. In particular, this clarifies the nontrivial dependence on the position of the selected site.	
 Pulsar Timing Array Experiments	JPWVerbiest, SOsowski and SBurkeSpolaor	None	None	Pulsar timing is a technique that uses the highly stable spin periods of neutron stars to investigate a wide range of topics in physics and astrophysics. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) use sets of extremely well-timed pulsars as a Galaxy-scale detector with arms extending between Earth and each pulsar in the array. These challenging experiments look for correlated deviations in the pulsars‚Äô timing that are caused by low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) traversing our Galaxy. PTAs are particularly sensitive to GWs at nanohertz frequencies, which makes them complementary to other space- and ground-based detectors. In this chapter, we will describe the methodology behind pulsar timing; provide an overview of the potential uses of PTAs; and summarise where current PTA-based detection efforts stand. Most predictions expect PTAs to successfully detect a cosmological background of GWs emitted by supermassive black-hole binaries and also potentially detect continuous-wave emission from binary supermassive black holes, within the next several years.

 Transient ionization potential depression in nonthermal dense plasmas at high x-ray intensity	Rui Jin, Malik Muhammad Abdullah, Zoltan Jurek, Robin Santra, SangKil Son	rui.jin@cfel.de	None	The advent of x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), which provide intense ultrashort x-ray pulses, has brought a new way of creating and analyzing hot and warm dense plasmas in the laboratory. Because of the ultrashort pulse duration, the XFEL-produced plasma will be out of equilibrium at the beginning and even the electronic subsystem may not reach thermal equilibrium while interacting with a femtosecond time-scale pulse. In the dense plasma, the ionization potential depression (IPD) induced by the plasma environment plays a crucial role for understanding and modeling microscopic dynamical processes. However, all theoretical approaches for IPD have been based on local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and it has been controversial to use LTE IPD models for the nonthermal situation. In this work, we propose a non-LTE (NLTE) approach to calculate the IPD effect by combining a quantum-mechanical electronic-structure calculation and a classical molecular dynamics simulation. This hybrid approach enables us to investigate the time evolution of ionization potentials and IPDs during and after the interaction with XFEL pulses, without the limitation of the LTE assumption. In our NLTE approach, the transient IPD values are presented as distributions evolving with time, which cannot be captured by conventional LTE-based models. The time-integrated ionization potential values are in good agreement with benchmark experimental data on solid-density aluminum plasma and other theoretical predictions based on LTE. The present work is promising to provide critical insights into nonequilibrium dynamics of dense plasma formation and thermalization induced by XFEL pulses.	
 Automating Program Structure Classification	Will Crichton, Georgia Gabriela Sampaio, Pat Hanrahan	wcrichto@cs.stanford.edu	None	When students write programs, their program structure provides insight into their learning process. However, analyzing program structure by hand is time-consuming, and teachers need better tools for computer-assisted exploration of student solutions. As a first step towards an education-oriented program analysis toolkit, we show how supervised machine learning methods can automatically classify student programs into a predetermined set of high-level structures. We evaluate two models on classifying student solutions to the Rainfall problem: a nearest-neighbors classifier using syntax tree edit distance and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that these models can achieve 91% classification accuracy when trained on 108 programs. We further explore the generality, trade-offs, and failure cases of each model.

 Hyper-hybrid entanglement, indistinguishability, and two-particle entanglement swapping	Soumya Das, Goutam Paul, Anindya Banerji	soumya06.das@gmail.com	None	Hyper-hybrid entanglement for two indistinguishable bosons has been recently proposed by Li et al. [Y. Li, M. Gessner, W. Li, and A. Smerzi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 050404 (2018) ]. In the current paper, we show that this entanglement exists for two indistinguishable fermions also. Next, we establish two no-go results: no hyper-hybrid entanglement for two distinguishable particles, and no unit fidelity quantum teleportation using indistinguishable particles. If either of these is possible, then the no-signaling principle would be violated. While several earlier works have attempted extending many results on distinguishable particles to indistinguishable ones, and vice versa, the above two no-go results establish a nontrivial separation between the two domains. Finally, we propose an efficient entanglement swapping using only two indistinguishable particles, whereas a minimum number of either three distinguishable or four indistinguishable particles is necessary for existing protocols.	
 Unveiling Spatial Patterns of Disaster Impacts and Recovery Using Credit Card Transaction Variances	Faxi YuanUrban ResilienceAI LabZachry Department of Civil andEnvironmental EngineeringTexas AM UniversityCollege Station, TX Amir EsmalianUrban ResilienceAI LabZachry Department of Civil andEnvironmental EngineeringTexas AM UniversityCollege Station, TX Bora OztekinUrban ResilienceAI LabDepartment of Computer Science and EngineeringTexas AM UniversityCollege Station, TX Ali MostafaviUrban ResilienceAI LabZachry Department of Civil andEnvironmental EngineeringTexas AM UniversityCollege Station, TX	None	None	The objective of this study is to examine spatial patterns of disaster impacts and recovery of communities based on variances in credit card transactions. Such variances could capture the collective effects of household impacts, disrupted accesses, and business closures, and thus provide an integrative measure for examining disaster impacts and community recovery in disasters. Existing studies depend mainly on survey and sociodemographic data for disaster impacts and recovery effort evaluations, although such data has limitations, including large data collection efforts and delayed timeliness results. In addition, there are very few studies have concentrated on spatial patterns and disparities of disaster impacts and short-term recovery of communities, although such investigation can enhance situational awareness during disasters and support the identification of disparate spatial patterns of disaster impacts and recovery in the impacted regions. This study examines credit card transaction data Harris County (Texas, USA) during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to explore spatial patterns of disaster impacts and recovery during from the perspective of community residents and businesses at ZIP code and county scales, respectively, and to further investigate their spatial disparities across ZIP codes. The results indicate that individuals in ZIP codes with populations of higher income experienced more severe disaster impact and recovered more quickly than those located in lower-income ZIP codes for most business sectors. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of spatial patterns and disparities in disaster impacts and recovery for better community resilience assessment, but also could benefit emergency managers, city planners, and public officials in harnessing population activity data, using credit card transactions as a proxy for activity, to improve situational awareness and resource allocation.

 Two-Way Passive Beamforming Design for RIS-Aided FDD Communication Systems	Bei Guo, Chenhao Sun and Meixia TaoDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, ChinaEmail guobei, sjtusch, mxtaosjtueducn	None	None	Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are able to provide passive beamforming gain via low-cost reflecting elements and hence improve wireless link quality. This work considers two-way passive beamforming design in RIS-aided frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems where the RIS reflection coefficients are the same for downlink and uplink and should be optimized for both directions simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization of the transmit/receive beamformers at the base station (BS) and the RIS reflection coefficients. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of the downlink and uplink rates, where the weighting parameter is adjustable to obtain different achievable downlink-uplink rate pairs. We develop an efficient manifold optimization algorithm to obtain a stationary solution. For comparison, we also introduce two heuristic designs based on one-way optimization, namely, time-sharing and phase-averaging. Simulation results show that the proposed manifold-based two-way optimization design significantly enlarges the achievable downlink-uplink rate region compared with the two heuristic designs. It is also shown that phase-averaging is superior to time-sharing when the number of RIS elements is large.

 With Measured Words: Simple Sentence Selection for Black-Box Optimization of Sentence Compression Algorithms	Yotam ShichelBenGurion UniversityMeir KalechBen Gurion UniversityOren TsurBen Gurion University	None	None	Sentence Compression is the task of generating a shorter, yet grammatical version of a given sentence, preserving the essence of the original sentence. This paper proposes a Black-Box Optimizer for Compression ( B-BOC ): given a black-box compression algorithm and assuming not all sentences need be compressed ‚Äì find the best candidates for compression in order to maximize both compression rate and quality. Given a required compression ratio, we consider two scenarios: (i) single-sentence compression, and (ii) sentences-sequence compression. In the first scenario, our optimizer is trained to predict how well each sentence could be compressed while meeting the specified ratio requirement. In the latter, the desired compression ratio is applied to a sequence of sentences (e.g., a paragraph) as a whole, rather than on each individual sentence. To achieve that, we use B-BOC to assign an optimal compression ratio to each sentence, then cast it as a Knapsack problem, which we solve using bounded dynamic programming. We evaluate B-BOC on both scenarios on three datasets, demonstrating that our optimizer improves both accuracy and Rouge-F1-score compared to direct application of other compression algorithms.

 Acousto-optic Ptychography	Moriya Rosenfeld, Daniel Doktofsky, Gil Weinberg, Yunzhe Li, Lei Tian, Ori Katz	None	None	Acousto-optic imaging (AOI) enables optical-contrast imaging deep inside scattering samples via localized ultrasound-modulation of scattered light. While AOI allows optical investigations at depths, its imaging resolution is inherently limited by the ultrasound wavelength, prohibiting microscopic investigations. Here, we propose a novel computational imaging approach that allows to achieve optical diffraction-limited imaging using a conventional AOI system. We achieve this by extracting diffraction-limited imaging information from ‚Äômemory-effect‚Äô speckle-correlations in the conventionally detected ultrasound-modulated scattered-light fields. Specifically, we identify that since speckle correlations allow to estimate the Fourier-magnitude of the field inside the ultrasound focus, scanning the ultrasound focus enables robust diffraction-limited reconstruction of extended objects using ptychography, i.e. we exploit the ultrasound focus as the scanned spatial-gate ‚Äòprobe‚Äô required for ptychographic phase-retrieval. Moreover, we exploit the short speckle decorrelation-time in dynamic media, which is usually considered a hurdle for wavefront-shaping based approaches, for improved ptychographic reconstruction. We experimentally demonstrate non-invasive imaging of targets that extend well beyond the memory-effect range, with a 40-times resolution improvement over conventional AOI, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art approaches.	
 Implementation of a radial disk ionization profile in the relxill_nk model	AskarBAbdikamalov, DimitryAyzenberg, CosimoBambi, HonghuiLiu, YuexinZhang	None	None	Very steep reflection emissivity profiles in the inner part of accretion disks are commonly found in the analysis of X-ray observations of black hole binaries and AGN, but there is some debate about their exact origin. While steep reflection emissivity profiles can be naturally produced by compact coronae close to black holes, the measured radial emissivity parameter can be further increased by the radial disk ionization profile when the theoretical model assumes a disk with constant ionization. In this paper, we implement the possibility of a radial disk ionization profile in the reflection model relxill_nk , which is a package designed to calculate reflection spectra of ‚Äúdeformed‚Äù Kerr black holes. We analyze a NuSTAR observation of the black hole binary EXO 1846‚Äì031, which was previously found to have a very high inner emissivity index. We find that the model with a radial disk ionization profile improves the fit, but the impact on the estimate of the black hole spin parameter and on the constraint of the deformation parameter is modest. However, we show that the analysis of future observations of Athena and eXTP will necessarily require models with a radial disk ionization profile to have accurate constraints of the deformation parameters.

 Towards Practical Robustness Analysis for DNNs based on PAC-Model Learning	Renjue Li, Pengfei Yang, ChengChao Huang, Youcheng Sun, Bai Xue, Lijun Zhang	lirj19@ios.ac.cn	None	To analyse local robustness properties of deep neural networks (DNNs), we present a practical framework from a model learning perspective. Based on black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in a prototypical tool named DeepPAC . As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC , with 4 baselines (using formal verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO , and it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification tool ERAN . Also, its results are consistent with existing DNN testing work like DeepGini .

The aim is to investigate the observed change in the well known asymmetric energy of spontaneous fission of 252 252 {}^{252} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 252 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Cf as the fragments pass through increasingly thick absorber foils.

 Muon identification in a compact single-layered water Cherenkov detector and gamma/hadron discrimination using Machine Learning techniques	Conceioaddr,addr, BS Gonzlezaddr,addr,addr, Guillnaddr, Pimentaaddr,addr, Tomaddr,addr	None	None	The muon tagging is an essential tool to distinguish between gamma and hadron-induced showers in wide field-of-view gamma-ray observatories. In this work, it is shown that an efficient muon tagging (and counting) can be achieved using a water Cherenkov detector with a reduced water volume and 4 PMTs, provided that the PMT signal spatial and time patterns are interpreted by an analysis based on Machine Learning (ML). The developed analysis has been tested for different shower and array configurations. The output of the ML analysis, the probability of having a muon in the WCD station, has been used to notably discriminate between gamma and hadron induced showers with S / B ‚àº 4 similar-to ùëÜ ùêµ 4 S/\sqrt{B}\sim 4 italic_S / square-root start_ARG italic_B end_ARG ‚àº 4 for shower with energies E 0 ‚àº 1 similar-to subscript ùê∏ 0 1 E_{0}\sim 1\, italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àº 1 TeV.

 Thermal corrections in Bardeen type regular black holes	Yawar HKhan, Prince AGanai	iyhkphy@gmail.com,princeganai@nitsri.com	None	We carry quantum (thermal) corrections to the thermodynamics of regular black holes in detail. Firstly, we discuss the non-extended phase space thermodynamics of regular black holes. We obtain expressions for various thermodynamic quantities like temperature, entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, pressure, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy. Then we introduce quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of Bardeen type (toy model) of regular black holes. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of these corrections is carried by plotting all the corrected thermodynamic quantities. The comparative analysis is then done where the effects of these corrections can be clearly seen.	
 How to get from static to dynamic electromagnetism	Jrgen Knig	koenig@thp.uni-due.de	Theoretische Physik and CENIDE, Universit√§t Duisburg-Essen, 47057 Duisburg, Germany	We demonstrate how to derive Maxwell‚Äôs equations, including Faraday‚Äôs law and Maxwell‚Äôs correction to Amp√®re‚Äôs law, by generalizing the description of static electromagnetism to dynamical situations. Thereby, Faraday‚Äôs law is introduced as a consequence of the relativity principle rather than an experimental fact, in contrast to the historical course and common textbook presentations. As a by-product, this procedure yields explicit expressions for the infinitesimal Lorentz and, upon integration, the finite Lorentz transformation. The proposed approach helps to elucidate the relation between Galilei and Lorentz transformations and provides an alternative derivation of the Lorentz transformation without explicitly referring to the speed of light.

Due to the nature of these systems, coordination among agents via communication is frequently necessary. Indeed, Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loops, or Perception-Action loops closed over a communication channel, are a critical component of multi-robot systems. However, we lack appropriate tools for simulating PAC loops. To that end, in this paper, we introduce ROS-NetSim , a ROS package that acts as an interface between robotic and network simulators. With ROS-NetSim, we can attain high-fidelity representations of both robotic and network interactions by accurately simulating the PAC loop. Our proposed approach is lightweight, modular and adaptive. Furthermore, it can be used with many available network and physics simulators by making use of our proposed interface. In summary, ROS-NetSim is (i) Transparent to the ROS target application, (ii) Agnostic to the specific network and physics simulator being used, and (iii) Tunable in fidelity and complexity. As part of our contribution, we have made available an open-source implementation of ROS-NetSim to the community.

We discuss further extensions of the theorem, including general Horndeski theories from disformal transformations.

 Game-Theoretic and Machine Learning-based Approaches for Defensive Deception: A Survey	Mu Zhu, Ahmed Anwar, Zelin Wan, JinHee Cho, Charles Kamhoua, and Munindar Singh	None	None	Defensive deception is a promising approach for cyber defense. Via defensive deception, the defender can anticipate attacker actions; it can mislead or lure attacker, or hide real resources. Although defensive deception is increasingly popular in the research community, there has not been a systematic investigation of its key components, the underlying principles, and its tradeoffs in various problem settings. This survey paper focuses on defensive deception research centered on game theory and machine learning, since these are prominent families of artificial intelligence approaches that are widely employed in defensive deception. This paper brings forth insights, lessons, and limitations from prior work. It closes with an outline of some research directions to tackle major gaps in current defensive deception research.

We propose a general framework to generate sparse, in-distribution counterfactual model explanations which match a desired target prediction with a conditional generative model, allowing batches of counterfactual instances to be generated with a single forward pass. The method is flexible with respect to the type of generative model used as well as the task of the underlying predictive model. This allows straightforward application of the framework to different modalities such as images, time series or tabular data as well as generative model paradigms such as GANs or autoencoders and predictive tasks like classification or regression. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on image (CelebA), time series (ECG) and mixed-type tabular (Adult Census) data.	
 An open-source tool to assess the carbon footprint of research	Jrme Mariette, Odile Blanchard, Olivier Bern, Tamara BenAri, 	None	None	Research institutions are bound to contribute to greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction efforts for several reasons. First, part of the scientific community‚Äôs research deals with climate change issues. Second, scientists contribute to students‚Äô education : they must be consistent and role models. Third the literature on the carbon footprint of researchers points to the high level of some individual footprints. In a quest for consistency and role models, scientists, teams of scientists or universities have started to quantify their carbon footprints and debate on reduction options. Indeed, measuring the carbon footprint of research activities requires tools designed to tackle its specific features. In this paper, we present an open-source web application, GES 1point5 , developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from several research labs in France. GES 1point5 is specifically designed to estimate the carbon footprint of research activities in France. It operates at the scale of research labs, i.e., laboratoires , which are the social structures around which research is organized in France and the smallest decision making entities in the French research system. The application allows French research labs to compute their own carbon footprint along a standardized, open protocol. The data collected in a rapidly growing network of labs will be used as part of the Labos 1point5 project to estimate France‚Äôs research carbon footprint. We expect that an international adoption of GES 1point5 (adapted to fit domestic specifics) could contribute to establishing a global understanding of the drivers of the research carbon footprint worldwide and the levers to decrease it.

We determined the amplitudes (the largest 13-month smoothed monthly ISSN) of Solar Cycles 12 ‚Äì 24 and the 13-month smoothed monthly mean corrected areas of the sunspot groups in the Sun‚Äôs whole-sphere (WSGA), northern hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere (SSGA) at the epochs of the maxima of Solar Cycles 12 ‚Äì 24. Using all these we obtained the relations similar to that found in our earlier analyzes‚Äì i . e . formulae-sequence ùëñ ùëí i.e. italic_i . italic_e . the existence of a high correlation between the sum of the areas of sunspot groups in the southern-hemisphere near-equatorial band during a small (7‚Äì9 months) interval just after a maximum epoch of a solar cycle and the amplitude of next solar cycle‚Äìseparately for the Sun‚Äôs whole-sphere and northern- and southern-hemispheres. By using these relations we predict ‚âà \approx ‚âà 701 msh (millionth of solar hemisphere), ‚âà \approx ‚âà 429 msh, and ‚âà \approx ‚âà 366 msh for the values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA, respectively, at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. We predict 86 ¬± 18 plus-or-minus 86 18 86\pm 18 86 ¬± 18 for the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25. The 13-month smoothed monthly mean sunspot-group area highly correlate with that of ISSN. Using this relation and the predicted values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA we obtain 68 ¬± 11 plus-or-minus 68 11 68\pm 11 68 ¬± 11 for the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25, which is slightly lower than the aforementioned predicted value, and 39 ¬± 4 plus-or-minus 39 4 39\pm 4 39 ¬± 4 and 31 ¬± 6 plus-or-minus 31 6 31\pm 6 31 ¬± 6 for the values of northern- and southern-hemispheres‚Äô sunspot numbers at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. The difference between the predicted NSGA and SSGA and also that between northern- and southern-hemispheres‚Äô sunspot numbers at the maximum epoch of Cycle 25 are considerably small. Overall, our results suggest that the amplitude of Cycle 25 would be 25 %‚Äì40 % smaller, and the corresponding north‚Äìsouth asymmetry would be much smaller, than those of Cycle 24.

 Security of the decoy state method for quantum key distribution	AS Trushechkin, EO Kiktenko, DA Kronberg, AK Fedorov	None	None	Quantum cryptography or, more precisely, quantum key distribution (QKD), is one of the advanced areas in the field of quantum technologies. The confidentiality of keys distributed with the use of QKD protocols is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. This paper is devoted to the decoy state method, a countermeasure against vulnerabilities caused by the use of coherent states of light for QKD protocols whose security is proved under the assumption of single-photon states. We give a formal security proof of the decoy state method against all possible attacks. We compare two widely known attacks on multiphoton pulses: photon-number splitting and beam splitting. Finally, we discuss the equivalence of polarization and phase coding.

 Twisted light-induced spin-spin interaction in a chiral helimagnet	Yutaro Goto, Hajime Ishihara, Nobuhiko Yokoshi	goto-2@pe.osakafu-u.ac.jp	None	We theoretically investigate how the orbital angular momentum of light can affect a chiral magnetic order. Here, we consider a metallic chiral helimagnet, which is under stationary radiation of a resonant optical vortex beam. We propose a novel interaction between local spins considering microscopic interactions between an optical vortex and electrons. This vortex-induced interaction modulates the chiral magnetic order in an entirely different way than an external magnetic field does. Our spin modulation technique may pave a route to create a unique topological or chiral structure for future opto-spintronics devices.	
 Obsolete Personal Information Update System for the Prevention of Falls among Elderly Patients	Salma Chaieb, Brahim Hnich, Ali Ben Mrad	salma.chaieb2@yahoo.com	University of Sousse, ISITCom, 4011, Sousse, Tunisia;	Falls are a common problem affecting the older adults and a major public health issue. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and World Health Organization report that one in three adults over the age of 65 and half of the adults over 80 fall each year. In recent years, an ever-increasing range of applications have been developed to help deliver more effective falls prevention interventions. All these applications rely on a huge elderly personal database collected from hospitals, mutual health, and other organizations in caring for elderly. The information describing an elderly is continually evolving and may become obsolete at a given moment and contradict what we already know on the same person. So, it needs to be continuously checked and updated in order to restore the database consistency and then provide better service. This paper provides an outline of an Obsolete personal Information Update System (OIUS) designed in the context of the elderly-fall prevention project. Our OIUS aims to control and update in real-time the information acquired about each older adult, provide on-demand consistent information and supply tailored interventions to caregivers and fall-risk patients. The approach outlined for this purpose is based on a polynomial-time algorithm build on top of a causal Bayesian network representing the elderly data. The result is given as a recommendation tree with some accuracy level. We conduct a thorough empirical study for such a model on an elderly personal information base. Experiments confirm the viability and effectiveness of our OIUS.

 M√∂bius Disjointness for product flows of rigid dynamical systems and affine linear flows	Fei Wei	weif@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn	Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China	We obtain that Sarnak‚Äôs M√∂bius Disjointness Conjecture holds for product flows between affine linear flows on compact abelian groups of zero topological entropy and a class of rigid dynamical systems.

 Detection of Dynamical Regime Transitions with Lacunarity as a Multiscale Recurrence Quantification Measure	Tobias BraunComplexity Science RDPotsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Potsdam, GermanyTel Vishnu RUnniDepartment of Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringPrinceton UniversityNJ, USAR ISujithIndian Institute of Technology MadrasChennai IndiaJuergen KurthsComplexity Science RDPotsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Potsdam, GermanyNorbert MarwanUniversity of PotsdamInstitute of Geosciences Potsdam, Germany	None	None	We propose lacunarity as a novel recurrence quantification measure and illustrate its efficacy to detect dynamical regime transitions which are exhibited by many complex real-world systems. We carry out a recurrence plot based analysis for different paradigmatic systems and nonlinear empirical data in order to demonstrate the ability of our method to detect dynamical transitions ranging across different temporal scales. It succeeds to distinguish states of varying dynamical complexity in the presence of noise and non-stationarity, even when the time series is of short length. In contrast to traditional recurrence quantifiers, no specification of minimal line lengths is required and rather geometric features beyond linear structures in the recurrence plot can be accounted for. This makes lacunarity more broadly applicable as a recurrence quantification measure. Lacunarity is usually interpreted as a measure of heterogeneity or translational invariance of an arbitrary spatial pattern. In application to recurrence plots, it quantifies the degree of heterogenity in the temporal recurrence patterns at all relevant time scales. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method when applied to empirical data, namely time series of acoustic pressure fluctuations from a turbulent combustor. Recurrence lacunarity captures both the rich variability in dynamical complexity of acoustic pressure fluctuations and shifting time scales encoded in the recurrence plots. Furthermore, it contributes to a better distinction between stable operation and near blowout states of combustors.	
 A modified Kaƒçanov iteration scheme with application to quasilinear diffusion models	Pascal Heid, Thomas PWihler	pascal.heid@maths.ox.ac.uk	Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX2 6GG, UK	The classical Kaƒçanov scheme for the solution of nonlinear variational problems can be interpreted as a fixed point iteration method that updates a given approximation by solving a linear problem in each step. Based on this observation, we introduce a modified Kaƒçanov method , which allows for (adaptive) damping, and, thereby, to derive a new convergence analysis under more general assumptions and for a wider range of applications. For instance, in the specific context of quasilinear diffusion models, our new approach does no longer require a standard monotonicity condition on the nonlinear diffusion coefficient to hold. Moreover, we propose two different adaptive strategies for the practical selection of the damping parameters involved.	
 Plasma steering to avoid disruptions in ITER and tokamak power plants	Allen Boozer	None	None	Steering tokamak plasmas is commonly viewed as a way to avoid disruptions and runaway electrons. Plasma steering sounds as safe as driving to work but will be shown to more closely resemble driving at high speed through a dense fog on an icy road. The long time required to terminate an ITER discharge compared to time over which dangers can be foreseen is analogous to driving in a dense fog. The difficulty of regaining plasma control if it is lost resembles driving on an icy road. Disruptions and runaways are associated with three issues‚Äîa solution to one tends to complicate the solution to the other two: loss of plasma position control, excessive heat deposition, and wall melting due to runaway electrons. All three risks must be addressed for ITER to achieve its mission and essentially eliminated before tokamak power plants can be deployed.	
 Estimates for solutions of homogeneous time-delay systems: Comparison of Lyapunov‚ÄìKrasovskii and Lyapunov‚ÄìRazumikhin techniques	GPortillaa, IVAlexandrovab, SMondiaand APZhabkob	None	None	In this contribution, the estimates for the response of time delay systems with nonlinear homogeneous right-hand side of degree strictly greater than one are constructed. The existing results obtained via the Lyapunov‚ÄìRazumikhin approach are reminded. Their proofs, revisited in the appendix, lead to explicit expressions of the involved constants. Based on a recently introduced Lyapunov‚ÄìKrasovskii functional and known estimates of the domain of attraction, we present new estimates of the system response. We compare both approaches and discuss the illustrative examples.

 1 The instant folded string configuration. Defining the arrow of time as ùëë‚Å¢ùë°/ùëë‚Å¢ùúè we see that it flips sign at ùúè=0. One might argue that a more natural definition of the arrow of time, that compares well with a point like trajectory, is ùëë‚Å¢ùë°/ùëë‚Å¢ùúé at the fold (ùúè=0). This definition too leads to an arrow of time flipping at ùúé=0. The red squeezed rings illustrate that this configuration describes a closed folded string that is created at an instant and grows rapidly with time.			None	Time-like linear dilaton triggers, at the classical level, the creation of closed folded strings at an instant. We show that in cosmology these instant folded strings induce negative pressure at no energy cost. Hence they seem to allow an era in which the energy density increases (decreases) while the universe is expanding (contracting). This and other aspects of instant folded strings suggest that they might shed new light on the origin of the arrow of time.	
 Spectral Leakage and Rethinking the Kernel Size in CNNs	Nergis Tomen, Jan van GemertComputer Vision Lab, Delft University of TechnologyDelft, CD, Netherlands		None	Convolutional layers in CNNs implement linear filters which decompose the input into different frequency bands. However, most modern architectures neglect standard principles of filter design when optimizing their model choices regarding the size and shape of the convolutional kernel. In this work, we consider the well-known problem of spectral leakage caused by windowing artifacts in filtering operations in the context of CNNs. We show that the small size of CNN kernels make them susceptible to spectral leakage, which may induce performance-degrading artifacts. To address this issue, we propose the use of larger kernel sizes along with the Hamming window function to alleviate leakage in CNN architectures. We demonstrate improved classification accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with the simple use of a standard window function in convolutional layers. Finally, we show that CNNs employing the Hamming window display increased robustness against various adversarial attacks. Code is available 1 1 1 Code will be made available at github. .	
 Sub-Quantum Fisher Information	Cerezo, Akira Sone, Jacob Beckey, Patrick Coles	None	None	The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) plays a crucial role in quantum information theory and in many practical applications such as quantum metrology. However, computing the QFI is generally a computationally demanding task. In this work we analyze a lower bound on the QFI which we call the sub-Quantum Fisher Information (sub-QFI). The bound can be efficiently estimated on a quantum computer for an n ùëõ n italic_n -qubit state using 2 n 2 ùëõ 2n 2 italic_n qubits. The sub-QFI is based on the super-fidelity, an upper bound on Uhlmann‚Äôs fidelity. We analyze the sub-QFI in the context of unitary families, where we derive several crucial properties including its geometrical interpretation. In particular, we prove that the QFI and the sub-QFI are maximized for the same optimal state, which implies that the sub-QFI is faithful to the QFI in the sense that both quantities share the same global extrema. Based on this faithfulness, the sub-QFI acts as an efficiently computable surrogate for the QFI for quantum sensing and quantum metrology applications. Finally, we provide additional meaning to the sub-QFI as a measure of coherence, asymmetry, and purity loss.	
 Codes approaching the Shannon limit with polynomial complexity per information bit	Ilya Dumer and Navid GharaviUniversity of California, Riverside, USAEmail dumereeucredu, navidgharaviemailucredu	None	None	We consider codes for channels with extreme noise that emerge in various low-power applications. Simple LDPC-type codes with parity checks of weight 3 are first studied for any dimension m ‚Üí ‚àû . ‚Üí ùëö m\rightarrow\infty. italic_m ‚Üí ‚àû . These codes form modulation schemes: they improve the original channel output for any S N R > ùëÜ ùëÅ ùëÖ absent SNR> italic_S italic_N italic_R > ‚àí 6 6 -6 - 6 dB (per information bit) and gain 3 3 3 3 dB over uncoded modulation as S N R ùëÜ ùëÅ ùëÖ SNR italic_S italic_N italic_R grows. However, they also have a floor on the output bit error rate (BER) irrespective of their length. Tight lower and upper bounds, which are virtually identical to simulation results, are then obtained for BER at any SNR. We also study a combined scheme that splits m ùëö m italic_m information bits into b ùëè b italic_b blocks and protects each with some polar code. Decoding moves back and forth between polar and LDPC codes, every time using a polar code of a higher rate. For a sufficiently large constant b ùëè b italic_b and m ‚Üí ‚àû ‚Üí ùëö m\rightarrow\infty italic_m ‚Üí ‚àû , this design yields a vanishing BER at any SNR that is arbitrarily close to the Shannon limit of -1.59 dB. Unlike other existing designs, this scheme has polynomial complexity of order m ln ‚Å° m ùëö ùëö m\ln m italic_m roman_ln italic_m per information bit.

The polymer completely dissociates when it is saturated with water, releasing small cations while anions remain bound to the polymer chains. When this strip is subject to an orthogonal electric field, the cations migrate towards the negative electrode, carrying water away by osmosis. This leads to the bending of the strip. We have previously published a modelling of this system based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. In this paper, we use this model to simulate numerically the bending of a strip. Since the amplitude of the deflection is large, we use a beam model in large displacements. In addition, the material permittivity may increase with ion concentration. We therefore test three permittivity models. We plot the profiles of the cations concentration, pressure, electric potential and induction, and we study the influence of the strip geometry on the tip displacement and on the blocking force. The results we obtain are in good agreement with the experimental data published in the literature. The variation of these quantities with the imposed electric potential allow us to discriminate between the three models.

The spin-polarization of the accelerated protons is robust for a variety of ramp lengths at around 80%. Significant increase of the ramp length is accompanied by collimation of low-polarization protons into the final beam and large transverse spread of the highly polarized protons with respect to the direction of laser propagation.

 Adversarial Learning of Poisson Factorisation Model for Gauging Brand Sentiment in User Reviews	Runcong Zhao, Lin Gui, Gabriele Pergola, Yulan HeDepartment of Computer Science, University of Warwick, UK	None	None	In this paper, we propose the Brand-Topic Model (BTM) which aims to detect brand-associated polarity-bearing topics from product reviews. Different from existing models for sentiment-topic extraction which assume topics are grouped under discrete sentiment categories such as ‚Äò positive ‚Äô, ‚Äò negative ‚Äô and ‚Äò neural ‚Äô, BTM is able to automatically infer real-valued brand-associated sentiment scores and generate fine-grained sentiment-topics in which we can observe continuous changes of words under a certain topic (e.g., ‚Äò shaver ‚Äô or ‚Äò cream ‚Äô) while its associated sentiment gradually varies from negative to positive. BTM is built on the Poisson factorisation model with the incorporation of adversarial learning. It has been evaluated on a dataset constructed from Amazon reviews. Experimental results show that BTM outperforms a number of competitive baselines in brand ranking, achieving a better balance of topic coherence and uniqueness, and extracting better-separated polarity-bearing topics.	
 Pricing Energy Storage in Real-time Market	Cong Chen,LangTong,and Ye Guo	None	None	The problem of pricing utility-scale energy storage resources (ESRs) in the real-time electricity market is considered. Under a rolling-window dispatch model where the operator centrally dispatches generation and consumption under forecasting uncertainty, it is shown that almost all uniform pricing schemes, including the standard locational marginal pricing (LMP), result in lost opportunity costs that require out-of-the-market settlements. It is also shown that such settlements give rise to disincentives for generating firms and storage participants to bid truthfully, even when these market participants are rational price-takers in a competitive market. Temporal locational marginal pricing (TLMP) is proposed for ESRs as a generalization of LMP to an in-market discriminative form. TLMP is a sum of the system-wide energy price, LMP, and the individual state-of-charge price. It is shown that, under arbitrary forecasting errors, the rolling-window implementation of TLMP eliminates the lost opportunity costs and provides incentives to price-taking firms to bid truthfully with their marginal costs. Numerical examples show insights into the effects of uniform and non-uniform pricing mechanisms on dispatch following and truthful bidding incentives.	
 ROOSTER: a machine-learning analysis tool for Kepler stellar rotation periods	SNBreton, ARGSantos, LBugnet, SMathur, RAGarca, PLPall	None	None	In order to understand stellar evolution, it is crucial to efficiently determine stellar surface rotation periods. Indeed, while they are of greatest importance in stellar models, angular momentum transport processes inside stars are still poorly understood today. Surface rotation, linked to the age of the star, is one of the constraints needed to improve the way those processes are modelled. Statistics of the surface rotation periods for a large sample of stars of different spectral types are thus necessary. An efficient tool to automatically determine reliable rotation periods is needed when dealing with large samples of stellar photometric datasets. The objective of this work is to develop such a tool. For this purpose, machine learning classifiers represent relevant bricks for the basis of our new methodology. Random forest learning abilities are exploited to automate the extraction of rotation periods in Kepler light curves. Rotation periods and complementary parameters are obtained from three different methods: a wavelet analysis, the autocorrelation function of the light curve, and the composite spectrum. We train three different classifiers: one to detect if rotational modulations are present in the light curve, one to flag close binary or classical pulsators candidates that can bias our rotation period determination, and finally one classifier to provide the final rotation period. We test our machine learning pipeline on 23,431 stars of the Kepler K and M dwarf reference rotation catalog of Santos et al. ( 2019 ) for which 60% of the stars have been visually inspected. For the sample of 21,707 stars where all the input parameters are provided to the algorithm, 94.2% of them are correctly classified (as rotating or not). Among the stars that have a rotation period in the reference catalog, the machine learning provides a period that agrees within 10% of the reference value for 95.3% of the stars. Moreover, the yield of correct rotation periods is raised to 99.5% after visually inspecting 25.2% of the stars. Over the two main analysis steps, rotation classification and period selection, the pipeline yields a global agreement with the reference values of 92.1% and 96.9% before and after visual inspection. Random forest classifiers are efficient tools to determine reliable rotation periods in large samples of stars. The methodology presented here could be easily adapted to extract surface rotation periods for stars with different spectral types or observed by other instruments such as K2, TESS or, in a near future, PLATO.

 Variational Neural Annealing	Mohamed HibatAllah, Estelle Inack, Roeland Wiersema, Roger Melko, Juan Carrasquilla	mohamed.hibat.allah@uwaterloo.ca	None	Many important challenges in science and technology can be cast as optimization problems. When viewed in a statistical physics framework, these can be tackled by simulated annealing, where a gradual cooling procedure helps search for groundstate solutions of a target Hamiltonian. While powerful, simulated annealing is known to have prohibitively slow sampling dynamics when the optimization landscape is rough or glassy. Here we show that by generalizing the target distribution with a parameterized model, an analogous annealing framework based on the variational principle can be used to search for groundstate solutions. Modern autoregressive models such as recurrent neural networks provide ideal parameterizations since they can be exactly sampled without slow dynamics even when the model encodes a rough landscape. We implement this procedure in the classical and quantum settings on several prototypical spin glass Hamiltonians, and find that it significantly outperforms traditional simulated annealing in the asymptotic limit, illustrating the potential power of this yet unexplored route to optimization.

In doing so, we define and develop a new canonical graph associated to a matrix, which as a consequence provides a novel perspective on the matrix determinant.	
 Mask-based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation			None	Semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a crucial component in image analysis. Training a CNN to perform semantic segmentation requires a large amount of labeled data, where the production of such labeled data is both costly and labor intensive. Semi-supervised learning algorithms address this issue by utilizing unlabeled data and so reduce the amount of labeled data needed for training. In particular, data augmentation techniques such as CutMix and ClassMix generate additional training data from existing labeled data. In this paper we propose a new approach for data augmentation, termed ComplexMix, which incorporates aspects of CutMix and ClassMix with improved performance. The proposed approach has the ability to control the complexity of the augmented data while attempting to be semantically-correct and address the tradeoff between complexity and correctness. The proposed ComplexMix approach is evaluated on a standard dataset for semantic segmentation and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results show that our method yields improvement over state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets for semantic image segmentation.	
 Performance of Cell-Free MmWave Massive MIMO Systems with Fronthaul Compression and DAC Quantization	Insoo Kim and Junil Choi	None	None	In this paper, the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder with max-min power allocation is proposed for cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) with limited-capacity fronthaul links. The proposed power allocation aims to achieve max-min fairness on the achievable rate lower bounds of the users obtained by the additive quantization noise model (AQNM), which mimics the effect of low-resolution DACs. To solve the max-min power allocation problem, an alternating optimization (AO) method is proposed, which is guaranteed to converge because the global optima of the subproblems that constitute the original problem are attained at each AO iteration. The performance of cell-free and small-cell systems is explored in the simulation results, which suggest that not-too-small fronthaul capacity suffices for cell-free systems to outperform small-cell systems.	
 Spatial Wideband Channel Estimation for MmWave Massive MIMO Systems with Hybrid Architectures and Low-Resolution ADCs	Insoo Kim and Junil Choi	None	None	In this paper, a channel estimator for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with hybrid architectures and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is proposed. To account for the propagation delay across the antenna array, which cannot be neglected in wideband mmWave massive MIMO systems, the discrete time channel that models the spatial wideband effect is developed. Also, the training signal design that addresses inter-frame, inter-user, and inter-symbol interferences is investigated when the spatial wideband effect is not negligible. To estimate the channel parameters over the continuum based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the Newtonized fully corrective forward greedy selection-cross validation-based (NFCFGS-CV-based) channel estimator is proposed. NFCFGS-CV is a gridless compressed sensing (CS) algorithm, whose termination condition is determined by the CV technique. The CV-based termination condition is proved to achieve the minimum squared error (SE). The simulation results show that NFCFGS-CV outperforms state-of-the-art on-grid CS-based channel estimators.	
 On ùë§-Optimization of the Split Covariance Intersection Filter	HaoLi	None	None	The split covariance intersection filter (split CIF) is a useful tool for general data fusion and has the potential to be applied in a variety of engineering tasks. An indispensable optimization step (referred to as w -optimization) involved in the split CIF concerns the performance and implementation efficiency of the Split CIF, but explanation on w -optimization is neglected in the paper [ 1 ] that provides a theoretical foundation for the Split CIF. This note complements [ 1 ] by providing a theoretical proof for the convexity of the w -optimization problem involved in the split CIF (convexity is always a desired property for optimization problems as it facilitates optimization considerably).	
 Measuring Dependence with Matrix-based Entropy Functional	Shujian Yu, Francesco Alesiani, Xi Yu, Robert Jenssen, Jos Prncipe	None	None	Measuring the dependence of data plays a central role in statistics and machine learning. In this work, we summarize and generalize the main idea of existing information-theoretic dependence measures into a higher-level perspective by the Shearer‚Äôs inequality. Based on our generalization, we then propose two measures, namely the matrix-based normalized total correlation ( T Œ± * superscript subscript ùëá ùõº T_{\alpha}^{*} italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) and the matrix-based normalized dual total correlation ( D Œ± * superscript subscript ùê∑ ùõº D_{\alpha}^{*} italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), to quantify the dependence of multiple variables in arbitrary dimensional space, without explicit estimation of the underlying data distributions. We show that our measures are differentiable and statistically more powerful than prevalent ones. We also show the impact of our measures in four different machine learning problems, namely the gene regulatory network inference, the robust machine learning under covariate shift and non-Gaussian noises, the subspace outlier detection, and the understanding of the learning dynamics of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to demonstrate their utilities, advantages, as well as implications to those problems. Code of our dependence measure is available at: https://bit.ly/AAAI-dependence .

We present different ways of training these autoencoders and we evaluate them to discriminate between distinct magnetic phases. In this process, we highlight the case of high temperature or even random training data. Finally, we analyze the capability of the autoencoder to detect the ground state degeneracy through the reconstruction error.	
 Solving a Multi-resource Partial-ordering Flexible Variant of the Job-shop Scheduling Problem with Hybrid ASP	Giulia Francescutto, Konstantin Schekotihin, Mohammed ElKholany	None	None	Many complex activities of production cycles, such as quality control or fault analysis, require highly experienced specialists to perform various operations on (semi)finished products using different tools. In practical scenarios, the selection of a next operation is complicated, since each expert has only a local view on the total set of operations to be performed. As a result, decisions made by the specialists are suboptimal and might cause significant costs. In this paper, we consider a Multi-resource Partial-ordering Flexible Job-shop Scheduling (MPF-JSS) problem where partially-ordered sequences of operations must be scheduled on multiple required resources, such as tools and specialists. The resources are flexible and can perform one or more operations depending on their properties. The problem is modeled using Answer Set Programming (ASP) in which the time assignments are efficiently done using Difference Logic. Moreover, we suggest two multi-shot solving strategies aiming at the identification of the time bounds allowing for a solution of the schedule optimization problem. Experiments conducted on a set of instances extracted from a medium-sized semiconductor fault analysis lab indicate that our approach can find schedules for 87 out of 91 considered real-world instances.	
 Planning to Repose Long and Heavy Objects Considering a Combination of Regrasp and Constrained Drooping	Mohamed RaessastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Weiwei Wanabsentast startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Keisuke KoyamastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Kensuke HaradastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Purpose of this paper: This paper presents a hierarchical motion planner for planning the manipulation motion to repose long and heavy objects considering external support surfaces. Design/methodology/approach: The planner includes a task level layer and a motion level layer. We formulate the manipulation planning problem at the task level by considering grasp poses as nodes and object poses for edges. We consider regrasping and constrained in-hand slip (drooping) during building graphs and find mixed regrasping and drooping sequences by searching the graph. The generated sequences autonomously divide the object weight between the arm and the support surface and avoid configuration obstacles. Cartesian planning is used at the robot motion level to generate motions between adjacent critical grasp poses of the sequence found by the task level layer. Findings: Various experiments are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed planner. The results show improved capability of robot arms to manipulate long and heavy objects using the proposed planner. What is original/value of paper: Our contribution is we initially develop a graph-based planning system that reasons both in-hand and regrasp manipulation motion considering external supports. On one hand, the planner integrates regrasping and drooping to realize in-hand manipulation with external support. On the other hand, it switches states by releasing and regrasping objects when the object is in stably placed. The search graphs‚Äô nodes could be retrieved from remote cloud servers that provide a large amount of pre-annotated data to implement cyber intelligence.	
 Open-Mindedness and Style Coordination in Argumentative Discussions	Aviv Ben HaimDepartment of Software andInformation Systems EngineeringBenGurion UniversityOren TsurDepartment of Software andInformation Systems EngineeringBenGurion University	None	None	Linguistic accommodation is the process in which speakers adjust their accent, diction, vocabulary, and other aspects of language according to the communication style of one another. Previous research has shown how linguistic accommodation correlates with gaps in the power and status of the speakers and the way it promotes approval and discussion efficiency. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on the phenomena, exploring its correlation with the open-mindedness of a speaker, rather than to her social status. We process thousands of unstructured argumentative discussions that took place in Reddit‚Äôs Change My View (CMV) subreddit, demonstrating that open-mindedness relates to the assumed role of a speaker in different contexts. On the discussion level, we surprisingly find that discussions that reach agreement present lower levels of accommodation.

 Subgap states in superconducting islands	Luka Pavei, Daniel Bauernfeind, Rok itko	None	None	We study an interacting quantum dot in contact with a superconducting island described by the Richardson model with a Coulomb repulsion term controlling the number of electrons on the island. This Hamiltonian admits a compact matrix-product-operator representation and can be efficiently and accurately solved using the density-matrix renormalization group. We systematically explore the effects of the charging energy E c subscript ùê∏ ùëê E_{c} italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . For E c subscript ùê∏ ùëê E_{c} italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT comparable to the superconducting gap Œî Œî \Delta roman_Œî , the subgap states are stabilized by the combination of Kondo exchange coupling and charge redistribution driven by the Coulomb interaction. The subgap states exist for both even and odd superconductor ground-state occupancy, but with very distinctive excitation spectra in each case. The spectral peaks are not symmetric with respect to the chemical potential and may undergo discontinuous changes as a function of gate voltages.

The measurements, which indicate that the electric field sensitivity is a factor of seven larger for site 1 relative to site 2 for a particular direction of the electric field are of direct interest both in the context of quantum information processing and laser frequency stabilization with rare-earth doped crystals, in which electric fields can be used to engineer experimental protocols by tuning transition frequencies.	
 Kerr-Nonlinearity-Induced Mode-Splitting in Optical Microresonators	GeorgeNGhalanos, JonathanMSilver, LeonardoDelBino, NiallMoroney, ShuangyouZhang, MichaelTMWoodley, AndreasSvela, PascalDelHaye	None	None	The Kerr effect in optical microresonators plays an important role for integrated photonic devices and enables third harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, and the generation of microresonator-based frequency combs. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity can split ultra-high-Q microresonator resonances for two continuous-wave lasers. The resonance splitting is induced by self- and cross-phase modulation and counter-intuitively enables two lasers at different wavelengths to be simultaneously resonant in the same microresonator mode. We develop a pump-probe spectroscopy scheme that allows us to measure power dependent resonance splittings of up to 35 cavity linewidths (corresponding to 52 MHz) at 10 mW of pump power. The required power to split the resonance by one cavity linewidth is only 286 ¬µ W times 286 microwatt 286\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro W} start_ARG 286 end_ARG start_ARG times end_ARG start_ARG roman_¬µ roman_W end_ARG . In addition, we demonstrate threefold resonance splitting when taking into account four-wave mixing and two counterpropagating probe lasers. These Kerr splittings are of interest for applications that require two resonances at optically controlled offsets, eg. for opto-mechanical coupling to phonon modes, optical memories, and precisely adjustable spectral filters.

 Comment on ‚ÄúConstraints on Low-Energy Effective Theories from Weak Cosmic Censorship‚Äù	Jie Jiang, Aofei Sang, Ming Zhang	jiejiang@mail.bnu.edu.cn	None	Recently, it was argued in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 , 031102 (2021)] that the WCCC can serve as a constraint to high-order effective field theories. However, we find there exists a key error in their approximate black hole solution. After correcting it, their calculation cannot show the ability of WCCC to constrain the gravitational theories.

 Dry and Moist Atmospheric Circulation with Uniform Sea-Surface Temperature	DL Suhas, Jai Sukhatme, Nili Harnik	None	None	The steady and transient response of ‚Äùdynamically‚Äù dry and moist atmospheres to uniform sea-surface temperature (SST) is studied. Specifically, the latent heat ( L v subscript ùêø ùë£ L_{v} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) of water vapor is varied, so that for small L v subscript ùêø ùë£ L_{v} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , water substance is essentially a passive tracer from a dynamical point of view. Despite the lack of SST gradients, a general circulation with Hadley and Ferrel cells is observed for relatively stronger moist coupling. Organized precipitation patterns via equatorial waves appear to play a significant role in tropical ascent, and along with the equatorial deformation radius, the Hadley cell width increases with coupling strength. An abrupt switch to a much shallower tropical cell is noted when the system becomes completely passive. In all cases, the Hadley cell is thermally indirect and is influenced by eddy fluxes which are strong in the upper and lower troposphere. Moist static energy is transported equatorward in the tropics and a larger amount is directed poleward in the midlatitudes. As a whole, there is an almost invariant poleward transport of moist static energy for relatively strong coupling of water substance. Transient extratropical activity is seen in the form of intense warm-core vortices for strong coupling, and these systems become weaker and smaller as L v subscript ùêø ùë£ L_{v} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT decreases. The drift of these moist vortices results in the observed poleward energy transport in the midlatitudes. In the tropics, intraseasonal variability is dominant and systematically shifts to longer time periods with stronger coupling. In fact, large-scale, low-frequency Kelvin waves and MJO-like modes disappear as water vapor becomes passive in nature. Finally, extreme rainfall events associated with cyclonic storms vanish as water vapor becomes dynamically inactive, however, moderate precipitation events increase leading to higher total precipitation for weaker coupling of water substance. Tropospheric heating due to a saturation of the outgoing longwave radiation results in an increase in the stability of the atmosphere for strong coupling, and provides a plausible physical mechanism for interpreting the behavior of precipitation.	
 Scalar Multiplet Dark Matter in a Fast Expanding Universe: resurrection of the desert region	Basabendu Barman, Purusottam Ghosh, Farinaldo Queiroz, Abhijit Kumar Saha	bb1988@iitg.ac.in	None	Abstract: We examine the impact of a faster expanding Universe on the phenomenology of scalar dark matter (DM) associated with S U ( 2 ) L ùëÜ ùëà subscript 2 ùêø SU(2)_{L} italic_S italic_U ( 2 ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT multiplets. Earlier works with radiation dominated Universe have reported the presence of desert region for both inert S U ( 2 ) L ùëÜ ùëà subscript 2 ùêø SU(2)_{L} italic_S italic_U ( 2 ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT doublet and triplet DM candidates where the DM is under abundant. We find that the existence of a faster expanding component before BBN can revive a substantial part of the desert parameter space consistent with relic density requirements and other direct and indirect search bounds. We also review the possible collider search prospects of the newly obtained parameter space and predict that such region might be probed at the future colliders with improved sensitivity via a disappearing/stable charged track.

The result follows from the study of the fundamental gap of geodesic balls as the radius goes to infinity. In the process, we improve the lower bound for the first eigenvalue of balls in hyperbolic space.	
 An MCMC method to determine properties of Complex Network ensembles	Oskar Pfeffer, Nora Molkenthin, Frank Hellmann, Oskar Pfeffer, Nora Molkenthin, Frank Hellmann, Oskar Pfeffer, Nora Molkenthin, Frank Hellmann, Oskar Pfeffer, Nora Molkenthin, Frank Hellmann, Oskar Pfeffer, Nora Molkenthin, Frank Hellmann	None	None	What do generic networks that have certain properties look like? We define Relative Canonical Network ensembles as the ensembles that realize a property R while being as indistinguishable as possible from a generic network ensemble. This allows us to study the most generic features of the networks giving rise to the property under investigation. To test the approach we apply it first to the network measure ‚Äùsmall-world-ness‚Äù, thought to characterize small-world networks. We find several phase transitions as we go to less and less generic networks in which cliques and hubs emerge. Such features are not shared by typical small-world networks, showing that high ‚Äùsmall-world-ness‚Äù does not characterize small-world networks as they are commonly understood. On the other hand we see that for embedded networks, the average shortest path length and total Euclidean link length are better at characterizing small-world networks, with hubs that emerge as a defining feature at low genericity. We expect the overall approach to have wide applicability for understanding network properties of real world interest.	
 A Note on Numbers			None	When are all positions of a game numbers? We show that two properties are necessary and sufficient. These properties are consequences of that, in a number, it is not an advantage to be the first player. One of these properties implies the other. However, checking for one or the other, rather than just one, can often be accomplished by only looking at the positions on the ‚Äòboard‚Äô. If the stronger property holds for all positions, then the values are integers.	
 Cognitive Perspectives on Context-based Decisions and ExplanationsThe work is partially supported by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.	Marcus Westberg, Kary FrmlingComputer Science Department, Ume University, Swedenmarcuswestbergumuse,karyframlingumuse	None	None	When human cognition is modeled in Philosophy and Cognitive Science, there is a pervasive idea that humans employ mental representations in order to navigate the world and make predictions about outcomes of future actions. By understanding how these representational structures work, we not only understand more about human cognition but also gain a better understanding for how humans rationalise and explain decisions. This has an influencing effect on explainable AI, where the goal is to provide explanations of computer decision-making for a human audience. We show that the Contextual Importance and Utility method for XAI share an overlap with the current new wave of action-oriented predictive representational structures, in ways that makes CIU a reliable tool for creating explanations that humans can relate to and trust.	
 Finite gyro-radius multidimensional electron hole equilibria	Hutchinson	ihutch@mit.edu	None	Finite electron gyro-radius influences on the trapping and charge density distribution of electron holes of limited transverse extent are calculated analytically and explored by numerical orbit integration in low to moderate magnetic fields. Parallel trapping is shown to depend upon the gyro-averaged potential energy and to give rise to gyro-averaged charge deficit. Both types of average are expressible as convolutions with perpendicular Gaussians of width equal to the thermal gyro-radius. Orbit-following confirms these phenomena but also confirms for the first time in self-consistent potential profiles the importance of gyro-bounce-resonance detrapping and consequent velocity diffusion on stochastic orbits. The averaging strongly reduces the trapped electron deficit that can be sustained by any potential profile whose transverse width is comparable to the gyro-radius r g subscript ùëü ùëî r_{g} italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_g end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . It effectively prevents equilibrium widths smaller than ‚àº r g similar-to absent subscript ùëü ùëî \sim r_{g} ‚àº italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_g end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for times longer than a quarter parallel-bounce-period. Avoiding gyro-bounce resonance detrapping is even more restrictive, except for very small potential amplitudes, but it takes multiple bounce-periods to act. Quantitative criteria are given for both types of orbit loss.	
 Machine Learning for the Detection and Identification of Internet of Things (IoT) Devices: A Survey	YongxinLiu,JianWang,JianqiangLi,Shuteng Niu,and HoubingSong	None	None	The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming an indispensable part of everyday life, enabling a variety of emerging services and applications. However, the presence of rogue IoT devices has exposed the IoT to untold risks with severe consequences. The first step in securing the IoT is detecting rogue IoT devices and identifying legitimate ones. Conventional approaches use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate and verify legitimate devices‚Äô identities. However, cryptographic protocols are not available in many systems. Meanwhile, these methods are less effective when legitimate devices can be exploited or encryption keys are disclosed. Therefore, non-cryptographic IoT device identification and rogue device detection become efficient solutions to secure existing systems and will provide additional protection to systems with cryptographic protocols. Non-cryptographic approaches require more effort and are not yet adequately investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on machine learning technologies for the identification of IoT devices along with the detection of compromised or falsified ones from the viewpoint of passive surveillance agents or network operators. We classify the IoT device identification and detection into four categories: device-specific pattern recognition, Deep Learning enabled device identification, unsupervised device identification, and abnormal device detection. Meanwhile, we discuss various ML-related enabling technologies for this purpose. These enabling technologies include learning algorithms, feature engineering on network traffic traces and wireless signals, continual learning, and abnormality detection.	
 Explosive nucleosynthesis of a metal-deficient star as the source of a distinct odd-even effect in the solar twin HIP 11915	Jhon Yana GalarzastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Jorge MelndezstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Amanda Karakas,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Martin AsplundstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Diego LorenzoOliveirastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversidade de So Paulo, Departamento de Astronomia do IAGUSP, Rua do Mato , Cidade Universitria, So Paulo, SP, BrazilstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMonash Centre for Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy, Monash University Victoria , AustraliastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in Dimensions ASTRO DstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMax Planck Institute for Astrophysics, KarlSchwarzschildStr , Garching, Germany	None	None	The abundance patterns observed in the Sun and in metal-poor stars show a clear odd-even effect. An important question is whether the odd-even effect in solar-metallicity stars is similar to the Sun, or if there are variations that can tell us about different chemical enrichment histories. In this work, we report for the first time observational evidence of a differential odd-even effect in the solar twin HIP 11915, relative to the solar odd-even abundance pattern. The spectra of this star were obtained with high resolving power (140 000) and signal-to-noise ratio ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 420) using the ESPRESSO spectrograph and the VLT telescope. Thanks to the high spectral quality, we obtained extremely precise stellar parameters ( œÉ ( T eff ) ùúé subscript ùëá eff \sigma(T_{\rm eff}) italic_œÉ ( italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = 2 K, œÉ ( [ Fe / H ] ) ùúé delimited-[] Fe H \sigma(\rm{[Fe/H]}) italic_œÉ ( [ roman_Fe / roman_H ] ) = 0.003 dex, and œÉ ( log ‚Å° g ) ùúé ùëî \sigma(\log g) italic_œÉ ( roman_log italic_g ) = 0.008 dex). We determine the chemical abundance of 20 elements ( Z ‚â§ 39 ùëç 39 Z\leq 39 italic_Z ‚â§ 39 ) with high precision ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 0.01 dex), which shows a strong pattern of the odd-even effect even after performing Galactic Chemical Evolution corrections. The odd-even effect is reasonably well-reproduced by a core-collapse supernova of 13 M ‚äô subscript M direct-product \rm{M_{\odot}} roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and metallicity Z = 0.001 diluted into a metal-poor gas of 1 M ‚äô subscript M direct-product \rm{M_{\odot}} roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . Our results indicate that HIP 11915 has an odd-even effect slightly different than the Sun, thus confirming a different supernova enrichment history.	
 Modeling and simulation of vascular tumors embedded in evolving capillary networks	Marvin FritzstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Prashant JhastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tobias Kppl,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tinsley OdenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Andreas WagnerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Barbara Wohlmuth,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this work, we present a coupled 3D-1D model of solid tumor growth within a dynamically changing vascular network to facilitate realistic simulations of angiogenesis. Additionally, the model includes erosion of the extracellular matrix, interstitial flow, and coupled flow in blood vessels and tissue. We employ continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn‚ÄìHilliard type phase-field models of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale version of Darcy‚Äôs law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by Poiseuille flow, and Starling‚Äôs law is applied to model the mass transfer in and out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is orchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factors (TAFs); blood vessels grow towards the increasing TAFs concentrations. This process is not deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due to the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, makes the growth of tumors stochastic. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a variety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the model and its ability to generate satellite tumors. Simulations of the effects of angiogenesis on tumor growth are presented as well as sample-independent features of cancer.

Kainat Khowaja, Mykhaylo Shcherbatyy, and Wolfgang Karl Hrdle	None	None	Driven by increased complexity of dynamical systems, the solution of system of differential equations through numerical simulation in optimization problems has become computationally expensive. This paper provides a smart data driven mechanism to construct low dimensional surrogate models. These surrogate models reduce the computational time for solution of the complex optimization problems by using training instances derived from the evaluations of the true objective functions. The surrogate models are constructed using combination of proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis functions and provides system responses by simple matrix multiplication. Using relative maximum absolute error as the measure of accuracy of approximation, it is shown surrogate models with latin hypercube sampling and spline radial basis functions dominate variable order methods in computational time of optimization, while preserving the accuracy. These surrogate models also show robustness in presence of model non-linearities. Therefore, these computational efficient predictive surrogate models are applicable in various fields, specifically to solve inverse problems and optimal control problems, some examples of which are demonstrated in this paper.	
 Traffic Reaction Model	Gy LiptkstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, PereirastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Kulcsr,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, KovcsstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, SzederknyistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this paper a novel non-negative finite volume discretization scheme is proposed for certain first order nonlinear partial differential equations describing conservation laws arising in traffic flow modelling. The spatially discretized model is shown to preserve several fundamentally important analytical properties of the conservation law (e.g., conservativeness, capacity) giving rise to a set of (second order) polynomial ODEs. Furthermore, it is shown that the discretized traffic flow model is formally kinetic and that it can be interpreted in a compartmental context. As a consequence, traffic networks can be represented as reaction graphs. It is shown that the model can be equipped with on- and off- ramps in a physically meaningful way, still preserving the advantageous properties of the discretization. Numerical case studies include empirical convergence tests, and the stability analysis presented in the paper paves the way to scalable observer and controller design.	
 Writers Gonna Wait: The Effectiveness of Notifications to Initiate Aversive Action in Writing Procrastination	Chatchai WangwiwattanaSunjoli AggarwalEric Larson	cwangwiwatta@smu.edu	Southern Methodist University, Department of Computer Science	This paper evaluates the use of notifications to reduce aversive-task-procrastination by helping initiate action. Specifically, we focus on aversion to graded writing tasks. We evaluate software designs commonly used by behavior change applications, such as goal setting and action support systems. We conduct a two-phase control trial experiment with 21 college students tasked to write two 3000-word writing assignments (14 students fully completed the experiment). Participants use a customized text editor designed to continuously collect writing behavior. The results from the study reveal that notifications have minimal effect in encouraging users to get started. They can also increase negative effects on participants. Other techniques, such as eliminating distraction and showing simple writing statistics, yield higher satisfaction among participants as they complete the writing task. Furthermore, the incorporation of text mining decreases aversion to the task and helps participants overcome writer‚Äôs block. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from our evaluation that help quantify the difficulty of behavior change for writing procrastination, with emphasis on goals for the HCI community.	
 Long-range spin-wave propagation in transversely magnetized nano-scaled conduits	Bjrn Heinz, Qi Wang, Michael Schneider, Elisabeth Wei, Akira Lentfert, Bert Lgel, Thomas Brcher, Carsten Dubs, Oleksandr Dobrovolskiy, Philipp Pirro, Andrii Chumak	bheinz@rhrk.uni-kl.de	None	Magnonics attracts increasing attention in the view of novel low-energy computation technologies based on spin waves. Recently, spin-wave propagation in longitudinally magnetized nano-scaled spin-wave conduits was demonstrated, proving the fundamental feasibility of magnonics at the sub- 100 nm times 100 nanometer 100\text{\,}\mathrm{nm} start_ARG 100 end_ARG start_ARG times end_ARG start_ARG roman_nm end_ARG scale. Transversely magnetized nano-conduits, which are of great interest in this regard as they offer a large group velocity and a potentially chirality-based protected transport of energy, have not yet been investigated due to their complex internal magnetic field distribution. Here, we present a study of propagating spin waves in a transversely magnetized nanoscopic yttrium iron garnet conduit of 50 nm times 50 nanometer 50\text{\,}\mathrm{nm} start_ARG 50 end_ARG start_ARG times end_ARG start_ARG roman_nm end_ARG width. Space and time-resolved micro-focused Brillouin-light-scattering spectroscopy is employed to measure the spin-wave group velocity and decay length. A long-range spin-wave propagation is observed with a decay length of up to 8.0 ¬± 1.5 ¬µ m times uncertain 8.0 1.5 micrometer 8.0\pm 1.5\text{\,}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m} start_ARG start_ARG 8.0 end_ARG ¬± start_ARG 1.5 end_ARG end_ARG start_ARG times end_ARG start_ARG roman_¬µ roman_m end_ARG and a large spin-wave lifetime of up to 44.7 ¬± 9.1 ns times uncertain 44.7 9.1 nanosecond 44.7\pm 9.1\text{\,}\mathrm{ns} start_ARG start_ARG 44.7 end_ARG ¬± start_ARG 9.1 end_ARG end_ARG start_ARG times end_ARG start_ARG roman_ns end_ARG . The results are supported with micro-magnetic simulations, revealing a single-mode dispersion relation in contrast to the common formation of localized edge modes for microscopic systems. Furthermore, a frequency non-reciprocity for counter-propagating spin waves is observed in the simulations and the experiment, caused by the trapezoidal cross-section of the structure. The revealed long-distance spin-wave propagation on the nanoscale is particularly interesting for an application in spin-wave devices, allowing for long-distance transport of information in magnonic circuits, as well as novel low-energy device architectures.

 Quantum Polarization of Qudit Channels	Ashutosh GoswamistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMehdi MhallastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTValentin SavinstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We provide a generalization of quantum polar codes to quantum channels with qudit-input, achieving the symmetric coherent information of the channel. Our scheme relies on a channel combining and splitting construction, where a two-qudit unitary randomly chosen from a unitary 2-design is used to combine two instances of a qudit-input channel. The inputs to the synthesized bad channels are frozen by sharing EPR pairs between the sender and the receiver, so our scheme is entanglement assisted. Using the fact that the generalized two-qudit Clifford group forms a unitary 2-design, we conclude that the channel combining operation can be chosen from this set. Moreover, we show that polarization also happens for a much smaller subset of two-qudit Cliffords, which is not a unitary 2-design. Finally, we show how to decode the proposed quantum polar codes on Pauli qudit channels.	
 Swarming bottom feeders: Flocking at solid-liquid interfaces	Niladri Sarkar, Abhik Basu, John Toner	niladri2002in@gmail.com	None	We present the hydrodynamic theory of coherent collective motion (‚Äúflocking‚Äù) at a solid-liquid interface, and many of its predictions for experiment. We find that such systems are stable, and have long-range orientational order, over a wide range of parameters. When stable, these systems exhibit ‚Äúgiant number fluctuations‚Äù, which grow as the 3/4th power of the mean number. Stable systems also exhibit anomalous rapid diffusion of tagged particles suspended in the passive fluid along any directions in a plane parallel to the solid-liquid interface, whereas the diffusivity along the direction perpendicular to the plane is not anomalous. In the remaining parameter space, the system becomes unstable.

 Cyber-Physical Energy Systems Security: Threat Modeling, Risk Assessment, Resources, Metrics, and Case Studies	Ioannis Zografopoulos,, Juan Ospina,, XiaoRui Liu,, and CharalambosKonstantinou	None	None	Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interconnected architectures that employ analog, digital, and communication resources for their interaction with the physical environment. CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system‚Äôs performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS.	
 In-silico modeling of early-stage biofilm formation	Pin Nie, Francisco Alarcon Oseguera, Ivn LpezMontero, Beln Orgaz, Chantal Valeriani, Massimo Pica Ciamarra	None	None	Several bacteria and bacteria strands form biofilms in different environmental conditions, e.g. pH, temperature, nutrients, etc. Biofilm growth, therefore, is an extremely robust process. Because of this, while biofilm growth is a complex process affected by several variables, insights into biofilm formation could be obtained studying simple schematic models. In this manuscript, we describe a hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo model for the simulation of the early stage formation of a biofilm, to explicitly demonstrate that it is possible to account for most of the processes expected to be relevant. The simulations account for the growth and reproduction of the bacteria, for their interaction and motility, for the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances and Psl trails. We describe the effect of these processes on the early stage formation of biofilms, in two dimensions, and also discuss preliminary three-dimensional results.	
 Proba-V-ref: Repurposing the Proba-V challenge for reference-aware super resolution	Ngoc Long NguyenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTJrmy Anger,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTAxel DavystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPablo AriasstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTGabriele FacciolostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The PROBA-V Super-Resolution challenge distributes real low-resolution image series and corresponding high-resolution targets to advance research on Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) for satellite images. However, in the PROBA-V dataset the low-resolution image corresponding to the high-resolution target is not identified. We argue that in doing so, the challenge ranks the proposed methods not only by their MISR performance, but mainly by the heuristics used to guess which image in the series is the most similar to the high-resolution target. We demonstrate this by improving the performance obtained by the two winners of the challenge only by using a different reference image, which we compute following a simple heuristic. Based on this, we propose PROBA-V-REF a variant of the PROBA-V dataset, in which the reference image in the low-resolution series is provided, and show that the ranking between the methods changes in this setting. This is relevant to many practical use cases of MISR where the goal is to super-resolve a specific image of the series, i.e. the reference is known. The proposed PROBA-V-REF should better reflect the performance of the different methods for this reference-aware MISR problem.	
 Novel Recording Studio Features for Music Information Retrieval	Ziemer, TimBremen Spatial Cognition Center, University of Bremen, Kiattipadungkul, PattararatFaculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University, Karuchit, TanyarinFaculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University	None	None	Producers of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) typically spend more time creating, shaping, mixing and mastering sounds, than with aspects of composition and arrangement. They analyze the sound by close listening and by leveraging audio metering and audio analysis tools, until they successfully created the desired sound aesthetics. DJs of EDM tend to play sets of songs that meet their sound ideal. We therefore suggest using audio metering and monitoring tools from the recording studio to analyze EDM, instead of relying on conventional low-level audio features. We test our novel set of features by a simple classification task. We attribute songs to DJs who would play the specific song. This new set of features and the focus on DJ sets is targeted at EDM as it takes the producer and DJ culture into account. With simple dimensionality reduction and machine learning these features enable us to attribute a song to a DJ with an accuracy of 63%. The features from the audio metering and monitoring tools in the recording studio could serve for many applications in Music Information Retrieval, such as genre, style and era classification and music recommendation for both DJs and consumers of electronic dance music.	
 Simulation of Lennard-Jones Potential on a Quantum Computer	Prabhat, Bikash Behera	prabhat.70707@gmail.com	None	Simulation of time dynamical physical problems has been a challenge for classical computers due to their time-complexity. To demonstrate the dominance of quantum computers over classical computers in this regime, here we simulate a semi-empirical model where two neutral particles interact through Lennard-Jones potential in a one dimensional system. We implement the above scenario on IBM quantum experience platform using a 5-qubit real device. We construct the Hamiltonian and then efficiently map it to quantum operators onto quantum gates using the time-evolutionary unitary matrix obtained from the Hamiltonian. We verify the results collected from the qasm-simulator and compare it with that of the 5-qubit real chip ibmqx2.	
 ISP Distillation			None	Nowadays, many of the images captured are ‚Äùobserved‚Äù by machines only and not by humans, for example, robots‚Äô or autonomous cars‚Äô cameras. High-level machine vision models, such as object recognition or semantic segmentation, assume images are transformed to some canonical image space by the camera ISP. However, the camera ISP is optimized for producing visually pleasing images to human observers and not for machines, thus, one may spare the ISP compute time and apply the vision models directly on the raw data. Yet, it has been shown that training such models directly on the RAW images results in a performance drop. To mitigate this drop in performance (without the need to annotate RAW data), we use a dataset of RAW and RGB image pairs, which can be easily acquired with no human labeling. We then train a model that is applied directly on the RAW data by using knowledge distillation such that the model predictions for RAW images will be aligned with the predictions of an off-the-shelf pre-trained model for processed RGB images. Our experiments show that our performance on RAW images for object classification and semantic segmentation are significantly better than a model trained on labeled RAW images. It also reasonably matches the predictions of a pre-trained model on processed RGB images, while saving the ISP compute overhead.

Besides exploring early structure formation, searching for protoclusters at even higher redshifts is particularly useful to probe the reionization. Here we report the discovery of the protocluster LAGER- z ùëß z italic_z 7OD1 at redshift of 6.93, when the universe was only 770 million years old and could be experiencing rapid evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium [ 7 , 8 ] . The protocluster is identified by an overdensity of 6 times the average galaxy density, and with 21 narrowband selected Ly Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± galaxies, among which 16 have been spectroscopically confirmed. At redshifts similar to or above this record, smaller protogroups with fewer members have been reported [ 9 , 10 ] .

The total volume of the ionized bubbles generated by its member galaxies is found to be comparable to the volume of the protocluster itself, indicating that we are witnessing the merging of the individual bubbles and that the intergalactic medium within the protocluster is almost fully ionized. LAGER- z ùëß z italic_z 7OD1 thus provides a unique natural laboratory to investigate the reionization process.	
 A next generation upgraded observing platform for the automated Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON)	Hale, Chaplin, Davies, Elsworth	None	None	The Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) is a collection of ground-based automated telescopes observing oscillations of the Sun.

We present development work on a prototype next generation observation platform, BiSON:NG, based almost entirely on inexpensive off-the-shelf components, and where the footprint is reduced to a size that can be inexpensively installed on the roof of an existing building. Continuous development is essential in ensuring that automated networks such as BiSON are well placed to observe the next solar cycle and beyond.

 Back‚ÄìProjection Pipeline	Pablo Navarrete Michelini,Hanwen Liu,Yunhua Lu,Xingqun Jiang,	None	None	We propose a simple extension of residual networks that works simultaneously in multiple resolutions. Our network design is inspired by the iterative back‚Äìprojection algorithm but seeks the more difficult task of learning how to enhance images. Compared to similar approaches, we propose a novel solution to make back‚Äìprojections run in multiple resolutions by using a data pipeline workflow. Features are updated at multiple scales in each layer of the network. The update dynamic through these layers includes interactions between different resolutions in a way that is causal in scale, and it is represented by a system of ODEs, as opposed to a single ODE in the case of ResNets. The system can be used as a generic multi‚Äìresolution approach to enhance images. We test it on several challenging tasks with special focus on super‚Äìresolution and raindrop removal. Our results are competitive with state‚Äìof‚Äìthe‚Äìarts and show a strong ability of our system to learn both global and local image features.

 Asymmetric Si-Slot Coupler with Nonreciprocal Response Based on Graphene Saturable Absorption	Alexandros Pitilakis,Dimitrios Chatzidimitriou,Traianos Yioultsis, ,andEmmanouil Kriezis	None	None	We present the study of a proof-of-concept integrated device that can be used as a nonlinear broadband isolator. The device is based on the asymmetric loading of a highly-confining silicon-slot photonic coupler with graphene layers, whose ultrafast and low-threshold saturable absorption can be exploited for nonreciprocal transmission between the cross-ports of the coupler. The structure is essentially a non-Hermitian system, whose exceptional points are briefly discussed. The nonlinear device is modeled with a coupled Schr√∂dinger equation system whose validity is checked by full-vector finite element-based beam-propagation method simulations in CW. The numerically computed performance reveals a nonreciprocal intensity range (NRIR) in the vicinity of 100 mW peak power with a bandwidth spanning tens of nanometers, from CW down to ps-long pulses. Finally, the combination of saturable absorption and self-phase modulation (Kerr effect) in graphene is studied, indicating the existence of two NRIR with opposite directionality.

 External light control of three-dimensional ultrashort far-infrared pulses in an inhomogeneous array of carbon nanotubes	Eduard Fedorov, Alexander Zhukov, Roland Bouffanais, Natalia Konobeeva, Evgeniya Boroznina, Boris Malomed, Herv Leblond, Dumitru Mihalache, Mikhail Belonenko, Nikolay Rosanov, Thomas George	None	None	We present a study of the propagation of three-dimensional (3D) bipolar electromagnetic ultrashort pulses in an inhomogeneous array of semiconductor carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the presence of a control high-frequency (HF) electric field. The inhomogeneity is present in the form of a layer with an increased concentration of conduction electrons, which acts as a barrier for the propagation of ultrashort electromagnetic pulses through the CNT array. The dynamics of the pulse is described by a nonlinear equation for the vector potential of the electromagnetic field (it takes the form of a 3D generalization of the sine-Gordon equation), derived from the Maxwell‚Äôs equations and averaged over the period of the HF control field. By means of systematic simulations, we demonstrate that, depending on the amplitude and frequency of the HF control, the ultrashort pulse approaching the barrier layer either passes it or bounces back. The layer‚Äôs transmissivity for the incident pulse is significantly affected by the amplitude and frequency of the HF control field, with the reflection coefficient nearly vanishing in intervals that make up a discrete set of transparency windows, which resembles the effect of the electromagnetically-induced transparency. Having passed the barrier, the ultrashort pulse continues to propagate, keeping its spatiotemporal integrity. The results may be used for the design of soliton valves, with the transmissivity of the soliton stream accurately controlled by the HF field.	
 A Trigger-Sense Memory Flow Framework for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction	Yongliang Shen, Xinyin Ma, Yechun Tang, Weiming Lu	syl@zju.edu.cn	None	Joint entity and relation extraction framework constructs a unified model to perform entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, which can exploit the dependency between the two tasks to mitigate the error propagation problem suffered by the pipeline model. Current efforts on joint entity and relation extraction focus on enhancing the interaction between entity recognition and relation extraction through parameter sharing, joint decoding, or other ad-hoc tricks (e.g., modeled as a semi-Markov decision process, cast as a multi-round reading comprehension task). However, there are still two issues on the table. First, the interaction utilized by most methods is still weak and uni-directional, which is unable to model the mutual dependency between the two tasks. Second, relation triggers are ignored by most methods, which can help explain why humans would extract a relation in the sentence. They‚Äôre essential for relation extraction but overlooked. To this end, we present a Trigger-Sense Memory Flow Framework (TriMF) for joint entity and relation extraction. We build a memory module to remember category representations learned in entity recognition and relation extraction tasks. And based on it, we design a multi-level memory flow attention mechanism to enhance the bi-directional interaction between entity recognition and relation extraction. Moreover, without any human annotations, our model can enhance relation trigger information in a sentence through a trigger sensor module, which improves the model performance and makes model predictions with better interpretation. Experiment results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results by improves the relation F1 to 52.44% (+3.2%) on SciERC, 66.49% (+4.9%) on ACE05, 72.35% (+0.6%) on CoNLL04 and 80.66% (+2.3%) on ADE.	
 1 Introduction			None	Skyrmions are chiral swirling magnetization structures with nanoscale size. These structures have attracted considerable attention due to their topological stability and promising applicability in nanodevices, since they can be displaced with spin-polarized currents. However, for the comprehensive implementation of skyrmions in devices, it is imperative to also attain control over their geometrical position. Here we show that, through thickness modulations introduced in the host material, it is possible to constrain three-dimensional skyrmions to desired regions. We investigate skyrmion structures in rectangular FeGe platelets with micromagnetic finite element element simulations. First, we establish a phase diagram of the minimum-energy magnetic state as a function of the external magnetic field strength and the film thickness. Using this understanding, we generate preferential sites for skyrmions in the material by introducing dot-like ‚Äúpockets‚Äù of reduced film thickness. We show that these pockets can serve as pinning centers for the skyrmions, thus making it possible to obtain a geometric control of the skyrmion position. This control allows stabilizing skyrmions at positions and in configurations that they would otherwise not attain. Our findings may have implications for technological applications in which skyrmions are used as units of information that are displaced along racetrack-type shift register devices.

 A two-step explainable approach for COVID-19 computer-aided diagnosis from chest x-ray images			None	Early screening of patients is a critical issue in order to assess immediate and fast responses against the spread of COVID-19. The use of nasopharyngeal swabs has been considered the most viable approach; however, the result is not immediate or, in the case of fast exams, sufficiently accurate. Using Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for early screening potentially provides faster and more accurate response; however, diagnosing COVID from CXRs is hard and we should rely on deep learning support, whose decision process is, on the other hand, ‚Äúblack-boxed‚Äù and, for such reason, untrustworthy. We propose an explainable two-step diagnostic approach, where we first detect known pathologies (anomalies) in the lungs, on top of which we diagnose the illness. Our approach achieves promising performance in COVID detection, compatible with expert human radiologists. All of our experiments have been carried out bearing in mind that, especially for clinical applications, explainability plays a major role for building trust in machine learning algorithms.

 Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network with Gaussian-based Grasping Representation for Robotic Grasping Detection	Hu CaostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Guang Chen,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Zhijun ListartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jianjie Lin,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alois KnollstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The method of deep learning has achieved excellent results in improving the performance of robotic grasping detection. However, the deep learning methods used in general object detection are not suitable for robotic grasping detection. Current modern object detectors are difficult to strike a balance between high accuracy and fast inference speed. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust fully convolutional neural network model to perform robotic grasping pose estimation from n-channel input image of the real grasping scene. The proposed network is a lightweight generative architecture for grasping detection in one stage. Specifically, a grasping representation based on Guassian kernel is introduced to encode training samples, which embodies the principle of maximum central point grasping confidence. Meanwhile, to extract multi-scale information and enhance the feature discriminability, a receptive field block (RFB) is assembled to the bottleneck of our grasping detection architecture. Besides, pixel attention and channel attention are combined to automatically learn to focus on fusing context information of varying shapes and sizes by suppressing the noise feature and highlighting the grasping object feature. Extensive experiments on two public grasping datasets, Cornell and Jacquard demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in balancing accuracy and inference speed. The network is an order of magnitude smaller than other excellent algorithms, while achieving better performance with accuracy of 98.9 % percent \% % and 95.6 % percent \% % on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets, respectively.

 Universal Approximation Properties for ODENet and ResNet	Yuto Aizawa, Masato Kimura	None	None	We prove a universal approximation property (UAP) for a class of ODENet and a class of ResNet, which are used in many deep learning algorithms.

We also show that ResNet has the same property as the depth tends to infinity. Furthermore, we derive explicitly the gradient of a loss function with respect to a certain tuning variable. We use this to construct a learning algorithm for ODENet. To demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm, we apply it to a regression problem, a binary classification, and a multinomial classification in MNIST.	
 Minimal elements for the limit weak order on affine Weyl groups	Christian Gaetz, Yibo Gao	gaetz@mit.edu	Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139	The limit weak order on an affine Weyl group was introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy [ 5 ] in their study of total positivity for loop groups [ 4 ] . They showed that in the case of the affine symmetric group the minimal elements of this poset coincide with the infinite fully commutative reduced words and with infinite powers of Coxeter elements. We answer several open problems raised there by classifying minimal elements in all affine types and relating these elements to the classes of fully commutative and Coxeter elements.

Performance testing is part of the development process at MongoDB, and integrated into our continuous integration system. We describe a set of changes to that performance testing environment designed to improve testing effectiveness. These changes help improve coverage, provide faster and more accurate signaling for performance changes, and help us better understand the state of performance. In addition to each component performing better, we believe that we have created and exploited a virtuous cycle: performance test improvements drive impact, which drives more use, which drives further impact and investment in improvements. Overall, MongoDB is getting faster and we avoid shipping major performance regressions to our customers because of this infrastructure.	
 Symmetric Matrix Ensemble and Integrable Hydrodynamic Chains	Costanza Benassi, Marta DellAtti, Antonio Moro	None	None	The partition function of the Symmetric Matrix Ensemble is identified with the œÑ ‚àí limit-from ùúè \tau- italic_œÑ - function of a particular solution of the Pfaff Lattice. We show that, in the case of even power interactions, in the thermodynamic limit, the œÑ ‚àí limit-from ùúè \tau- italic_œÑ - function corresponds to the solution of an integrable chain of hydrodynamic type. We prove that the hydrodynamic chain so obtained is diagonalisable and admits hydrodynamic reductions in Riemann invariants in an arbitrary number of components.	
 Data Flow Analysis of Asynchronous Systems using Infinite Abstract Domains	Snigdha Athaiya, Raghavan Komondoor, Narayan Kumar	None	None	Asynchronous message-passing systems are employed frequently to implement distributed mechanisms, protocols, and processes. This paper addresses the problem of precise data flow analysis for such systems. To obtain good precision, data flow analysis needs to somehow skip execution paths that read more messages than the number of messages sent so far in the path, as such paths are infeasible at run time. Existing data flow analysis techniques do elide a subset of such infeasible paths, but have the restriction that they admit only finite abstract analysis domains. In this paper we propose a generalization of these approaches to admit infinite abstract analysis domains, as such domains are commonly used in practice to obtain high precision. We have implemented our approach, and have analyzed its performance on a set of 14 benchmarks. On these benchmarks our tool obtains significantly higher precision compared to a baseline approach that does not elide any infeasible paths and to another baseline that elides infeasible paths but admits only finite abstract domains.

 Degenerated Liouvillians and Steady-State Reduced Density Matrices	Juzar Thingna, Daniel Manzano	None	None	Symmetries in an open quantum system lead to degenerated Liouvillian that physically implies the existence of multiple steady states. In such cases, obtaining the initial condition independent stead states is highly nontrivial since any linear combination of the true asymptotic states, which may not necessarily be a density matrix, is also a valid asymptote for the Liouvillian. Thus, in this work we consider different approaches to obtain the true steady states of a degenerated Liouvillian. In the ideal scenario, when the open system symmetry operators are known we show how these can be used to obtain the invariant subspaces of the Liouvillian and hence the steady states. We then discuss two other approaches that do not require any knowledge of the symmetry operators. These could be a powerful tool to deal with quantum many-body complex open systems. The first approach which is based on Gramm-Schmidt orthonormalization of density matrices allows us to obtain all the steady states, whereas the second one based on large deviations allows us to obtain the non-degenerated maximum and minimum current-carrying states. We discuss our method with the help of an open para-Benzene ring and examine interesting scenarios such as the dynamical restoration of Hamiltonian symmetries in the long-time limit and apply the method to study the eigenspacing statistics of the nonequilibrium steady state.	
 Eigenmodes and resonance vibrations of 2D nanomembranes ‚Äì Graphene and hexagonal boron-nitride	Alexander Savin	None	None	Natural and resonant oscillations of suspended circular graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) membranes (single-layer sheets lying on a flat substrate having a circular hole of radius R ùëÖ R italic_R ) have been simulated using full-atomic models. Substrates formed by flat surfaces of graphite and h-BN crystal, hexagonal ice, silicon carbide 6H-SiC and nickel surface (111) have been used. The presence of the substrate leads to the forming of a gap at the bottom of the frequency spectrum of transversal vibrations of the sheet. The frequencies of natural oscillations of the membrane (oscillations localized on the suspended section of the sheet) always lie in this gap, and the frequencies of oscillations decrease by increasing radius of the membrane as ( R + R i ) ‚àí 2 superscript ùëÖ subscript ùëÖ ùëñ 2 (R+R_{i})^{-2} ( italic_R + italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT with nonezero effective increase of radius R i > 0 subscript ùëÖ ùëñ 0 R_{i}>0 italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0 . The modeling of the sheet dynamics has shown that small periodic transversal displacements of the substrate lead to resonant vibrations of the membranes at frequencies close to eigenfrequencies of nodeless vibrations of membranes with a circular symmetry. The energy distribution of resonant vibrations of the membrane has a circular symmetry and several nodal circles, whose number i ùëñ i italic_i coincides with the number of the resonant frequency. The frequencies of the resonances decrease by increasing the radius of the membrane as ( R + R i ) Œ± i superscript ùëÖ subscript ùëÖ ùëñ subscript ùõº ùëñ (R+R_{i})^{\alpha_{i}} ( italic_R + italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT with exponent Œ± i < 2 subscript ùõº ùëñ 2 \alpha_{i}<2 italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 2 . The lower rate of resonance frequency decrease is caused by the anharmonicity of membrane vibrations.	
 Mismatched Decoding Reliability Function at Zero Rate	MarcoBondaschi,AlbertGuillniFbregas,andMarcoDalai	None	None	We derive an upper bound on the reliability function of mismatched decoding for zero-rate codes.

The bound is shown to coincide with the expurgated exponent at rate zero for a broad family of channel-decoding metric pairs.

 RGB-D Salient Object Detection via 3D Convolutional Neural Networks	Qian Chen, Ze Liu, Yi Zhang, Keren Fu,, Qijun Zhao,, Hongwei Du	None	None	RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) recently has attracted increasing research interest and many deep learning methods based on encoder-decoder architectures have emerged. However, most existing RGB-D SOD models conduct feature fusion either in the single encoder or the decoder stage, which hardly guarantees sufficient cross-modal fusion ability. In this paper, we make the first attempt in addressing RGB-D SOD through 3D convolutional neural networks. The proposed model, named RD3D , aims at pre-fusion in the encoder stage and in-depth fusion in the decoder stage to effectively promote the full integration of RGB and depth streams. Specifically, RD3D first conducts pre-fusion across RGB and depth modalities through an inflated 3D encoder, and later provides in-depth feature fusion by designing a 3D decoder equipped with rich back-projection paths (RBPP) for leveraging the extensive aggregation ability of 3D convolutions. With such a progressive fusion strategy involving both the encoder and decoder, effective and thorough interaction between the two modalities can be exploited and boost the detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that RD3D performs favorably against 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of four key evaluation metrics. Our code will be made publicly available: https://github.com/PPOLYpubki/RD3D.	
 Between Synchrony and Turbulence: Intricate Hierarchies of Coexistence Patterns	Sindre Haugland, Anton Tosolini, Katharina Krischer	None	None	Coupled oscillators, even identical ones, display a wide range of behaviours, among them synchrony and incoherence. The 2002 discovery of so-called chimera states, states of coexisting synchronized and unsynchronized oscillators, provided a possible link between the two and definitely showed that different parts of the same ensemble can sustain qualitatively different forms of motion. Here, we demonstrate that globally coupled identical oscillators can express a range of coexistence patterns more comprehensive than chimeras. A hierarchy of such states evolves from the fully synchronized solution in a series of cluster-splittings. At the far end of this hierarchy, the states further collide with their own mirror-images in phase space ‚Äì rendering the motion chaotic, destroying some of the clusters and thereby producing even more intricate coexistence patterns. A sequence of such attractor collisions can ultimately lead to full incoherence of only single asynchronous oscillators. Chimera states, with one large synchronized cluster and else only single oscillators, are found to be just one step in this transition from low- to high-dimensional dynamics.

 AirWare: Utilizing Embedded Audio and Infrared Signals for In-Air Hand-Gesture Recognition	Nibhrat Lohia, Raunak Mundada, Arya McCarthy, Eric Larson	nlohia@smu.edu	None	We introduce AirWare, an in-air hand-gesture recognition system that uses the already embedded speaker and microphone in most electronic devices, together with embedded infrared proximity sensors. Gestures identified by AirWare are performed in the air above a touchscreen or a mobile phone. AirWare utilizes convolutional neural networks to classify a large vocabulary of hand gestures using multi-modal audio Doppler signatures and infrared (IR) sensor information. As opposed to other systems which use high frequency Doppler radars or depth cameras to uniquely identify in-air gestures, AirWare does not require any external sensors. In our analysis, we use openly available APIs to interface with the Samsung Galaxy S5 audio and proximity sensors for data collection. We find that AirWare is not reliable enough for a deployable interaction system when trying to classify a gesture set of 21 gestures, with an average true positive rate of only 50.5% per gesture. To improve performance, we train AirWare to identify subsets of the 21 gestures vocabulary based on possible usage scenarios. We find that AirWare can identify three gesture sets with average true positive rate greater than 80% using 4‚Äì7 gestures per set, which comprises a vocabulary of 16 unique in-air gestures.	
 Decay amplitudes to three hadrons from finite-volume matrix elements	Maxwell Hansen, , Fernando RomeroLpez, , and Stephen Sharpe	None	None	We derive relations between finite-volume matrix elements and infinite-volume decay amplitudes, for processes with three spinless, degenerate and either identical or non-identical particles in the final state. This generalizes the Lellouch-L√ºscher relation for two-particle decays and provides a strategy for extracting three-hadron decay amplitudes using lattice QCD. Unlike for two particles, even in the simplest approximation, one must solve integral equations to obtain the physical decay amplitude, a consequence of the nontrivial finite-state interactions. We first derive the result in a simplified theory with three identical particles, and then present the generalizations needed to study phenomenologically relevant three-pion decays.

 Incorporating Expert Guidance in Epidemic Forecasting	Alexander RodrguezstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Bijaya AdhikaridaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Naren RamakrishnanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Aditya PrakashstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Forecasting influenza like illnesses (ILI) has rapidly progressed in recent years from an art to a science with a plethora of data-driven methods. While these methods have achieved qualified success, their applicability is limited due to their inability to incorporate expert feedback and guidance systematically into the forecasting framework. We propose a new approach leveraging the Seldonian optimization framework from AI safety and demonstrate how it can be adapted to epidemic forecasting. We study two types of guidance: smoothness and regional consistency of errors, where we show that by its successful incorporation, we are able to not only bound the probability of undesirable behavior to happen, but also to reduce RMSE on test data by up to 17%.	
 D-Net: Siamese based Network with Mutual Attention for Volume Alignment	JianQing Zheng, Ngee Han Lim, Bartomiej Papie	None	None	Alignment of contrast and non contrast-enhanced imaging is essential for quantification of changes in several biomedical applications. In particular, the extraction of cartilage shape from contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of tibiae requires accurate alignment of the bone, currently performed manually. Existing deep learning-based methods for alignment require a common template or are limited in rotation range. Therefore, we present a novel network, D-net, to estimate arbitrary rotation and translation between 3D CT scans that additionally does not require a prior template. D-net is an extension to the branched Siamese encoder-decoder structure connected by new mutual non-local links, which efficiently capture long-range connections of similar features between two branches. The 3D supervised network is trained and validated using preclinical CT scans of mouse tibiae with and without contrast enhancement in cartilage. The presented results show a significant improvement in the estimation of CT alignment, outperforming the current comparable methods.	
 Assessing the Impact: Does an Improvement to a Revenue Management System Lead to an Improved Revenue?	Greta Laage, Emma Frejinger, Andrea Lodi, Guillaume Rabusseau	None	None	Airlines and other industries have been making use of sophisticated Revenue Management Systems to maximize revenue for decades. While improving the different components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies, estimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked in the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the benefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions. This is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the generated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system as before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be small in relative value.	
 Learning From Revisions: Quality Assessment of Claims in Argumentation at Scale	Gabriella Skitalinskaya Jonas KlaffDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of BremenBremen, GermanyHenning WachsmuthDepartment of Computer SciencePaderborn UniversityPaderborn, Germany	None	None	Assessing the quality of arguments and of the claims the arguments are composed of has become a key task in computational argumentation. However, even if different claims share the same stance on the same topic, their assessment depends on the prior perception and weighting of the different aspects of the topic being discussed. This renders it difficult to learn topic-independent quality indicators. In this paper, we study claim quality assessment irrespective of discussed aspects by comparing different revisions of the same claim . We compile a large-scale corpus with over 377k claim revision pairs of various types from kialo.com , covering diverse topics from politics, ethics, entertainment, and others. We then propose two tasks: (a) assessing which claim of a revision pair is better, and (b) ranking all versions of a claim by quality. Our first experiments with embedding-based logistic regression and transformer-based neural networks show promising results, suggesting that learned indicators generalize well across topics. In a detailed error analysis, we give insights into what quality dimensions of claims can be assessed reliably. We provide the data and scripts needed to reproduce all results. 1 1 1 Data and code: https://github.com/GabriellaSky/claimrev	
 Self-similar solutions to the Hesse flow	Shun Maeta	shun.maeta@gmail.comormaeta@riko.shimane-u.ac.jp	"Department of Mathematics,
Shimane University, Nishikawatsu 1060 Matsue, 690-8504, Japan."	We define a Hesse soliton, that is, a self-similar solution to the Hesse flow on Hessian manifolds. On information geometry, the e ùëí e italic_e -connection and the m ùëö m italic_m -connection are important, which do not coincide with the Levi-Civita one. Therefore, it is interesting to consider a Hessian manifold with a flat connection which does not coincide with the Levi-Civita one. We call it a proper Hessian manifold. In this paper, we show that any compact proper Hesse soliton is expanding and any non-trivial compact gradient Hesse soliton is proper. Furthermore, we show that the dual space of a Hesse-Einstein manifold can be understood as a Hesse soliton.	
 Black Hole - Neutron Star Binary Mergers: The Imprint of Tidal Deformations and Debris	Bhavesh KhamesraaastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Miguel GraciaLinaresbbstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Pablo LagunabbstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	bhaveshkhamesra@gatech.edu, mgracia@austin.utexas.edu, pablo.laguna@austin.utexas.edu	aùëé{}^{a}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_a end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics and School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, U.S.A.bùëè{}^{b}start_FLOATSUP	The increase in the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers will bring additional detections of binary black hole and double neutron star mergers. It will also very likely add many merger events of black hole - neutron star binaries. Distinguishing mixed binaries from binary black holes mergers for high mass ratios could be challenging because in this situation the neutron star coalesces with the black hole without experiencing significant disruption. To investigate the transition of mixed binary mergers into those behaving more like binary black hole coalescences, we present results from merger simulations for different mass ratios. We show how the degree of deformation and disruption of the neutron star impacts the inspiral and merger dynamics, the properties of the final black hole, the accretion disk formed from the circularization of the tidal debris, the gravitational waves, and the strain spectrum and mismatches. The results also show the effectiveness of the initial data method that generalizes the Bowen-York initial data for black hole punctures to the case of binaries with neutron star companions.

 Multi-task Learning Approach for Automatic Modulation and Wireless Signal Classification	Anu Jagannath, Jithin Jagannath	None	None	Wireless signal recognition is becoming increasingly more significant for spectrum monitoring, spectrum management, and secure communications. Consequently, it will become a key enabler with the emerging fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G communications, Internet of Things networks, among others. State-of-the-art studies in wireless signal recognition have only focused on a single task which in many cases is insufficient information for a system to act on. In this work, for the first time in the wireless communication domain, we exploit the potential of deep neural networks in conjunction with multi-task learning (MTL) framework to simultaneously learn modulation and signal classification tasks. The proposed MTL architecture benefits from the mutual relation between the two tasks in improving the classification accuracy as well as the learning efficiency with a lightweight neural network model. Additionally, we consider the problem of heterogeneous wireless signals such as radar and communication signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. Accordingly, we have shown how the proposed MTL model outperforms several state-of-the-art single-task learning classifiers while maintaining a lighter architecture and performing two signal characterization tasks simultaneously. Finally, we also release the only known open heterogeneous wireless signals dataset that comprises of radar and communication signals with multiple labels.

Abhimanyu Gupta, Xi Qu	None	None	We propose a series-based nonparametric specification test for a regression function when data are spatially dependent, the ‚Äòspace‚Äô being of a general economic or social nature. Dependence can be parametric, parametric with increasing dimension, semiparametric or any combination thereof, thus covering a vast variety of settings. These include spatial error models of varying types and levels of complexity. Under a new smooth spatial dependence condition, our test statistic is asymptotically standard normal. To prove the latter property, we establish a central limit theorem for quadratic forms in linear processes in an increasing dimension setting. Finite sample performance is investigated in a simulation study, with a bootstrap method also justified and illustrated. Empirical examples illustrate the test with real-world data.	
 Ridge approximation for thin nematic polymer networks	Andrea Pedrini, Epifanio Virga	andrea.pedrini@unipv.it	None	Nematic polymer networks (NPNs) are nematic elastomers within which the nematic director is enslaved to the elastic deformation. The elastic free energy of a NPN sheet of thickness h ‚Ñé h italic_h has both stretching and bending components (the former scaling like h ‚Ñé h italic_h , the latter scaling like h 3 superscript ‚Ñé 3 h^{3} italic_h start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). NPN sheets bear a director field ùíé ùíé \bm{m} bold_italic_m imprinted in them (usually, uniformly throughout their thickness); they can be activated by changing the nematic order (e.g. by illumination or heating). This paper illustrates an attempt to compute the bending energy of a NPN sheet and to show which role it can play in determining the activated shape. Our approach is approximate: the activated surface consists of flat sectors connected by ridges , where the unit normal jumps and the bending energy is concentrated. By increasing the number of ridges, we should get closer to the real situation, where the activated surface is smooth and the bending energy is distributed on it. The method is applied to a disk with imprinted a spiraling hedgehog. It is shown that upon activation the disk, like a tiny hand, is able to grab a rigid lamina.	
 Regions of Attraction Estimation using Level Set Method for Complex Network System	Mengbang Zou, Yu Huang,Weisi GuostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,	None	None	Many complex engineering systems network together functional elements and balance demand loads (e.g. information on data networks, electric power on grids). This allows load spikes to be shifted and avoid a local overload. In mobile wireless networks, base stations (BSs) receive data demand and shift high loads to neighbouring BSs to avoid outage. The stability of cascade load balancing is important because unstable networks can cause high inefficiency. The research challenge is to prove the stability conditions for any arbitrarily large, complex, and dynamic network topology, and for any balancing dynamic function.	
 On the Performance of Image Recovery in Massive MIMO Communications	Phan Thi Kim Chinh, Trinh Van Chien, Tran Manh Hoang, Nguyen Tien Hoa , and Van Duc Nguyen	None	None	Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) has demonstrated as a potential candidate for 5G-and-beyond wireless networks. Instead of using Gaussian signals as most of the previous works, this paper makes a novel contribution by investigating the transmission quality of image data by utilizing the Massive MIMO technology. We first construct a framework to decode the image signal from the noisy received data in the uplink Massive MIMO transmission by utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Then, a low-pass filter is exploited to enhance the efficiency of the remaining noise and artifacts reduction in the recovered image. Numerical results demonstrate the necessity of a post-filtering process in enhancing the quality of image recovery.

In this work, we extend and further analyze the registration approach proposed in [Taddei, SISC, 2020]. The contributions of the present work are twofold.

Second, we discuss the extension to general two-dimensional geometries: towards this end, we introduce a spectral element approximation, which relies on a partition { Œ© q } q = 1 N dd superscript subscript subscript Œ© ùëû ùëû 1 subscript ùëÅ dd \{\Omega_{q}\}_{q=1}^{N_{\rm dd}} { roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_q = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_dd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT of the domain Œ© Œ© \Omega roman_Œ© such that Œ© 1 , ‚Ä¶ , Œ© N dd subscript Œ© 1 ‚Ä¶ subscript Œ© subscript ùëÅ dd \Omega_{1},\ldots,\Omega_{N_{\rm dd}} roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_dd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are isomorphic to the unit square. We further show that our spectral element approximation can cope with parameterized geometries. We present rigorous mathematical analysis to justify our proposal; furthermore, we present numerical results for a heat-transfer problem in an annular domain, a potential flow past a rotating symmetric airfoil, and an inviscid transonic compressible flow past a non-symmetric airfoil, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	
 VConstruct: Filling Gaps in Chl-a Data Using a Variational Autoencoder	Matthew EhrlerDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of VictoriaVictoria BC, Department of Computer ScienceUniversity of VictoriaVictoria BC	None	None	Remote sensing of Chlorophyll-a is vital in monitoring climate change. Chlorphyll-a measurements give us an idea of the algae concentrations in the ocean, which lets us monitor ocean health. However, a common problem is that the satellites used to gather the data are commonly obstructed by clouds and other artifacts. This means that time series data from satellites can suffer from spatial data loss. There are a number of algorithms that are able to reconstruct the missing parts of these images to varying degrees of accuracy, with Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) being the current standard. However, DINEOF is slow, suffers from accuracy loss in temporally homogenous waters, reliant on temporal data, and only able to generate a single potential reconstruction. We propose a machine learning approach to reconstruction of Chlorophyll-a data using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our accuracy results to date are competitive with but slightly less accurate than DINEOF. We show the benefits of our method including vastly decreased computation time and ability to generate multiple potential reconstructions. Lastly, we outline our planned improvements and future work.

77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."	This paper discusses capabilities that are essential to models applied in policy analysis settings and the limitations of direct applications of off-the-shelf machine learning methodologies to such settings. Traditional econometric methodologies for building discrete choice models for policy analysis involve combining data with modeling assumptions guided by subject-matter considerations. Such considerations are typically most useful in specifying the systematic component of random utility discrete choice models but are typically of limited aid in determining the form of the random component. We identify an area where machine learning paradigms can be leveraged, namely in specifying and systematically selecting the best specification of the random component of the utility equations. We review two recent novel applications where mixed-integer optimization and cross-validation are used to algorithmically select optimal specifications for the random utility components of nested logit and logit mixture models subject to interpretability constraints.	
 Filtered formal groups, Cartier duality, and derived algebraic geometry	Tasos Moulinos	None	None	We develop a notion of formal groups in the filtered setting and describe a duality relating these to a specified class of filtered Hopf algebras.

Traditionally, community prevalence has been assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However, despite the increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been met in most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method for communities to determine disease prevalence. This is further complicated by the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and spread varies across different spatial, temporal and demographics. In this study, we understand trends in the spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms surveys as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess community disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability. Using individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method predicts the likely percentage of population that tested positive for COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative error (MRE) of 60.40% with 95% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67). This implies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases than original in a population of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage of the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported symptoms data from previous days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15 (MRE of 23.61% with 95% confidence interval as (23.6, 13.7)) for New York. We present analysis on these results, exposing various clinical attributes of interest across different demographics. Lastly, we qualitatively analyse how various policy enactments (testing, curfew) affect the prevalence of COVID-19 in a community.

 Probing ùúáeV ALPs with future LHAASO observation of AGN ùõæ-ray spectra	Guangbo Long, Siyu Chen, Shuo Xu, HongHao Zhang	"zhh98@mail.sysu.edu.cn
         


         School of Physics, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, Chinazhh98@mail.sysu.edu.cn"	None	Axion-like particles (ALPs) are predicted in some well-motivated theories beyond the Standard Model. The TeV gamma-rays from active galactic nuclei (AGN) suffer attenuation by the pair production interactions with the cosmic background light (EBL/CMB) during its travel to the earth. The attenuation can be circumvented through photon-ALP conversions in the AGN and Galaxy magnetic-field, and a flux enhancement is expected to arise in the observed spectrum. In this work, we study the potential of the AGN gamma-ray spectrum for energy up to above 100 TeV to probe ALP-parameter space at around Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº eV, where the coupling g a Œ≥ subscript ùëî ùëé ùõæ g_{a\gamma} italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a italic_Œ≥ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is so far relatively weakly constrained. We find the nearby and bright sources, Mrk 501, IC 310 and M 87, are suitable for our objective. Assuming an intrinsic spectrum exponential cutoff energy, we extrapolate the observed spectra of these sources up to above 100 TeV by the models with/without ALPs.

 Rigidity of topological entropy of boundary maps associated to Fuchsian groups	Adam Abrams, Svetlana Katok, Ilie Ugarcovici	the.adam.abrams@gmail.com	Faculty of Pure and Applied Mathematics, Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, Wroc≈Çaw, 50370, Poland	Given a closed, orientable surface of constant negative curvature and genus g ‚â• 2 ùëî 2 g\geq 2 italic_g ‚â• 2 , we study a family of generalized Bowen‚ÄìSeries boundary maps and prove the following rigidity result: in this family the topological entropy is constant and depends only on the genus of the surface.

The proofs use conjugation to maps of constant slope.	
 Equidistribution in Families of Abelian Varieties and Uniformity	Lars Khne	lk@math.ku.dk	Institut for Matematiske FagUniversitetsparken 52100 K√∏benhavn √òDenmark	Using equidistribution techniques from Arakelov theory as well as recent results obtained by Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, we deduce uniform results on the Manin-Mumford and the Bogomolov conjecture. For each given integer g ‚â• 2 ùëî 2 g\geq 2 italic_g ‚â• 2 , we prove that the number of torsion points lying on a smooth complex algebraic curve of genus g ùëî g italic_g embedded into its Jacobian is uniformly bounded. Complementing other recent work of Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, we obtain a rather uniform version of the Mordell conjecture as well. In particular, the number of rational points on a smooth algebraic curve defined over a number field can be bounded solely in terms of its genus and the Mordell-Weil rank of its Jacobian.	
 TDMSci: A Specialized Corpus for Scientific Literature Entity Tagging of Tasks Datasets and Metrics	Yufang Hou, Charles Jochim, Martin Gleize, Francesca Bonin and Debasis GangulyIBM Research Europe, Ireland	None	None	Tasks , Datasets and Evaluation Metrics are important concepts for understanding experimental scientific papers. However, most previous work on information extraction for scientific literature mainly focuses on the abstracts only, and does not treat datasets as a separate type of entity Zadeh and Schumann ( 2016 ); Luan et al.

We report experiment results on TDM extraction using a simple data augmentation strategy and apply our tagger to around 30,000 NLP papers from the ACL Anthology.

 Extraction of the multiplicity dependence of Multiparton Interactions from LHC pp data using Machine Learning techniques	Antonio Ortiz, Erik Zepeda	antonio.ortiz@nucleares.unam.mx	None	Over the last years, Machine Learning (ML) methods have been successfully applied to a wealth of problems in high-energy physics. For instance, in a previous work we have reported that using ML techniques one can extract the Multiparton Interactions (MPI) activity from minimum-bias pp data. Using the available LHC data on transverse momentum spectra as a function of multiplicity, we reported the average number of MPI ( ‚ü® N mpi ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùëÅ mpi \langle N_{\rm mpi}\rangle ‚ü® italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_mpi end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© ) for minimum-bias pp collisions at s = 5.02 ùë† 5.02 \sqrt{s}=5.02 square-root start_ARG italic_s end_ARG = 5.02 and 13 TeV. In this work, we apply the same analysis to a new set of data. We report that ‚ü® N mpi ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùëÅ mpi \langle N_{\rm mpi}\rangle ‚ü® italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_mpi end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© amounts to 3.98 ¬± 1.01 plus-or-minus 3.98 1.01 3.98\pm 1.01 3.98 ¬± 1.01 for minimum-bias pp collisions at s = 7 ùë† 7 \sqrt{s}=7 square-root start_ARG italic_s end_ARG = 7 TeV. These complementary results suggest a modest center-of-mass energy dependence of ‚ü® N mpi ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùëÅ mpi \langle N_{\rm mpi}\rangle ‚ü® italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_mpi end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© . The study is further extended aimed at extracting the multiplicity dependence of ‚ü® N mpi ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùëÅ mpi \langle N_{\rm mpi}\rangle ‚ü® italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_mpi end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© for the three center-of-mass energies. We show that our results qualitatively agree with existing ALICE measurements sensitive to MPI. Namely, ‚ü® N mpi ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùëÅ mpi \langle N_{\rm mpi}\rangle ‚ü® italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_mpi end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© increases approximately linearly with the charged-particle multiplicity. But, it deviates from the linear dependence at large charged-particle multiplicities. The deviation from the linear trend can be explained in terms of a bias towards harder processes given the multiplicity selection at mid-pseudorapidity. The results reported in this paper provide additional evidence of the presence of MPI in pp collisions, and they can be useful for a better understanding of the heavy-ion-like behaviour observed in pp data.	
 Proline isomerization regulates the phase behavior of elastin-like polypeptides in water	Yani Zhao, Kurt Kremer	None	None	Responsiveness of polypeptides and polymers in aqueous solution plays an important role in biomedical applications and in designing advanced functional materials. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a well-known class of synthetic intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which exhibit a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in pure water. The LCST transition can be further tuned by proline isomerization. Here, we study and compare the influence of cis / trans proline isomerization on the collapse of single ELPs in aqueous solution. Our results reveal that cis isomers play an important role in tuning the phase behavior of ELPs by hindering peptide-water hydrogen bonding while promoting intramolecular interactions.	
 Emergent Communication under Competition	Michael Noukhovitch, Travis LaCroix, Angeliki Lazaridou, Aaron Courville	noukhovm@mila.quebec	None	The literature in modern machine learning has only negative results for learning to communicate between competitive agents using standard RL. We introduce a modified sender-receiver game to study the spectrum of partially-competitive scenarios and show communication can indeed emerge in a competitive setting. We empirically demonstrate three key takeaways for future research. First, we show that communication is proportional to cooperation, and it can occur for partially competitive scenarios using standard learning algorithms. Second, we highlight the difference between communication and manipulation and extend previous metrics of communication to the competitive case. Third, we investigate the negotiation game where previous work failed to learn communication between independent agents (Cao et al . , 2018 ) . We show that, in this setting, both agents must benefit from communication for it to emerge; and, with a slight modification to the game, we demonstrate successful communication between competitive agents. We hope this work overturns misconceptions and inspires more research in competitive emergent communication. Code is available at http://github.com/mnoukhov/emergent-compete

 QFold: Quantum Walks and Deep Learning to Solve Protein Folding	Casares, Roberto Campos, MartinDelgado	pabloamo@ucm.es	None	Predicting the 3D structure of proteins is one of the most important problems in current biochemical research. In this article, we explain how to combine recent deep learning advances with the well known technique of quantum walks applied to a Metropolis algorithm. The result, QFold, is a fully scalable hybrid quantum algorithm that, in contrast to previous quantum approaches, does not require a lattice model simplification and instead relies on the much more realistic assumption of parameterization in terms of torsion angles of the amino acids. We compare it with its classical analog for different annealing schedules and find a polynomial quantum advantage, and implement a minimal realization of the quantum Metropolis in IBMQ Casablanca quantum system.	
 Deep Epidemiological Modeling by Black-box Knowledge Distillation: An Accurate Deep Learning Model for COVID-19	Dongdong Wang,Shunpu Zhang,Liqiang Wang	None	None	An accurate and efficient forecasting system is imperative to the prevention of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in public health. This system requires accurate transient modeling, lower computation cost, and fewer observation data. To tackle these three challenges, we propose a novel deep learning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and efficient transmission dynamics prediction in a practical manner. First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use. The case study on COVID-19 justifies that our approach accurately projects infections with much lower computation cost when observation data are limited.	
 PAWLS: PDF Annotation With Labels and Structure	Mark NeumannZejiang ShenAllen Institute for Artificial IntelligenceSam Skjonsberg	None	None	Adobe‚Äôs Portable Document Format (PDF) is a popular way of distributing view-only documents with a rich visual markup. This presents a challenge to NLP practitioners who wish to use the information contained within PDF documents for training models or data analysis, because annotating these documents is difficult. In this paper, we present PDF Annotation with Labels and Structure ( PAWLS ), a new annotation tool designed specifically for the PDF document format. PAWLS is particularly suited for mixed-mode annotation and scenarios in which annotators require extended context to annotate accurately. PAWLS supports span-based textual annotation, N-ary relations and freeform, non-textual bounding boxes, all of which can be exported in convenient formats for training multi-modal machine learning models.

Mingyu CaistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Shaoping XiaostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Zhijun ListartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Zhen KanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	This paper studies the control synthesis of motion planning subject to uncertainties. The uncertainties are considered in robot motions and environment properties, giving rise to the probabilistic labeled Markov decision process (PL-MDP). A Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (RL) method is developed to generate a finite-memory control policy to satisfy high-level tasks expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas. One of the novelties is to translate LTL into a limit deterministic generalized B√ºchi automaton (LDGBA) and develop a corresponding embedded LDGBA (E-LDGBA) by incorporating a tracking-frontier function to overcome the issue of sparse accepting rewards, resulting in improved learning performance and allowing to apply deterministic policies. Due to potentially conflicting tasks, a relaxed product MDP is developed to allow the agent to revise its motion plan without strictly following the desired LTL constraints if the specified tasks can only be partially fulfilled. An expected return composed of violation rewards and accepting rewards is developed. The designed violation function quantifies the differences between the revised and the desired motion plans, while the accepting rewards are proposed to enforce the satisfaction of the acceptance condition of the relaxed product MDP. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL algorithm that optimizes the expected return is guaranteed to find policies that, in decreasing order, can 1) satisfy the acceptance condition of relaxed product MDP and 2) reduce the violation cost over long-term behaviors. Also, we validate the control synthesis approach via simulation and experimental results.

 Transition from shear-dominated to Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence	Stefano Brizzolara,, JeanPaul Mollicone,, Maarten van Reeuwijk, Andrea Mazzino, Markus Holzner,	brizzolara@ifu.baug.ethz.ch	None	Turbulent mixing layers in nature are often characterized by the presence of a mean shear and an unstable buoyancy gradient between two streams of different velocity. Depending on the relative strength of shear versus buoyancy, either the former or the latter may dominate the turbulence and mixing between the two streams. In this paper, we present a phenomenological theory that leads to the identification of two distinct turbulent regimes: an early regime, dominated by the mean shear, and a later regime dominated by the buoyancy. The main theoretical result consists of the identification of a cross-over time-scale that discerns between the shear- and the buoyancy-dominated turbulence. This cross-over time depends on three large-scale constants of the flow, namely the buoyancy difference, the velocity difference between the two streams, and the gravitational acceleration. We validate our theory against direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of a temporal turbulent mixing layer compounded with an unstable stratification. We observe that the cross-over time correctly predicts the transition from shear to buoyancy driven turbulence, in terms of turbulent kinetic energy production, energy spectra scaling and mixing layer thickness.	
 Bounds on the heat transfer rate via passive advection	Gautam Iyer, TruongSon Van	gautam@math.cmu.edu	"Department of Mathematical Sciences,
Carnegie Mellon University,
Pittsburgh, PA 15213."	In heat exchangers, an incompressible fluid is heated initially and cooled at the boundary. The goal is to transfer the heat to the boundary as efficiently as possible. In this paper we study a related steady version of this problem where a steadily stirred fluid is uniformly heated in the interior and cooled on the boundary. For a given large P√©clet number, how should one stir to minimize some norm of the temperature? This version of the problem was previously studied by Marcotte, Doering et al. (SIAM Appl. Math ‚Äô18) in a disk, where the authors used matched asymptotics to show that when the P√©clet number, Pe Pe \operatorname{Pe} roman_Pe , is sufficiently large one can stir the fluid in a manner that ensures the total heat is O ( 1 / Pe ) ùëÇ 1 Pe O(1/\operatorname{Pe}) italic_O ( 1 / roman_Pe ) . In this paper we confirm their results with rigorous proofs, and also provide an almost matching lower bound. For simplicity, we work on the infinite strip instead of the unit disk and the proof uses probabilistic techniques.	
 H√∂lder regularity and convergence for a non-local model of nematic liquid crystals in the large-domain limit	Giacomo Canevariand Jamie Taylor	None	None	We consider a non-local free energy functional, modelling a competition between entropy and pairwise interactions reminiscent of the second order virial expansion, with applications to nematic liquid crystals as a particular case. We build on previous work on understanding the behaviour of such models within the large-domain limit, where minimisers converge to minimisers of a quadratic elastic energy with manifold-valued constraint, analogous to harmonic maps. We extend this work to establish H√∂lder bounds for (almost-)minimisers on bounded domains, and demonstrate stronger convergence of (almost)-minimisers away from the singular set of the limit solution. The proof techniques bear analogy with recent work of singularly perturbed energy functionals, in particular in the context of the Ginzburg-Landau and Landau-de Gennes models.	
 Precise Calibration of the One-Loop Trispectrum in the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure	Theodore Steele, Tobias Baldauf	ts715@cam.ac.uk	None	The Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the universe has the potential to provide decisive answers to the remaining open questions in cosmology. Early attempts at modelling it analytically focused on using perturbation theory. However, small-scale effects introduced by gravitational collapse cannot be described perturbatively and this failure of perturbation theory is reflected even on the largest scales. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) has emerged as a consistent method for describing LSS on large scales by introducing counterterms that account for the effects of small-scale dynamics. So far studies of the EFT have mostly focused on the two and three point functions with little attention devoted to the four point function or trispectrum. The trispectrum probes cubic interactions arising from non-linear clustering, biasing, and primordial non-Gaussianities, and constitutes a key element of the covariance matrix of the power spectrum. In this paper, we present explicit calibrations of the EFT counterterms for the one-loop trispectrum. Specifically, we find clear evidence for non-zero EFT corrections. We define two one-parameter ans√§tze for the counterterm of the one-loop propagator and show that they provide a good correction to the residual at scales below k ‚àº 0.07 h Mpc ‚àí 1 similar-to ùëò 0.07 ‚Ñé superscript Mpc 1 k\sim 0.07h\ \text{Mpc}^{-1} italic_k ‚àº 0.07 italic_h Mpc start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . We then take the amplitudes of the linear and quadratic counterkernels calculated in our previous paper on the bispectrum and use them in the remaining counterterms, establishing consistency of the counterterms in the two, three and four point function. We also show that the commonly used EdS approximation for the growth of the density fields leads to errors that are of the same magnitude as loop corrections to the trispectrum on large scales.	
 Fundamental solutions and Hadamard states for a scalar field with arbitrary boundary conditions on an asymptotically AdS spacetimes	Claudio Dappiaggi,,,a,,,astartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , , italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alessio Marta,,,b,,,bstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , , italicb endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We consider the Klein-Gordon operator on an n ùëõ n italic_n -dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime ( M , g ) ùëÄ ùëî (M,g) ( italic_M , italic_g ) together with arbitrary boundary conditions encoded by a self-adjoint pseudodifferential operator on ‚àÇ M ùëÄ \partial M ‚àÇ italic_M of order up to 2 2 2 2 . Using techniques from b ùëè b italic_b -calculus and a propagation of singularities theorem, we prove that there exist advanced and retarded fundamental solutions, characterizing in addition their structural and microlocal properties. We apply this result to the problem of constructing Hadamard two-point distributions. These are bi-distributions which are weak bi-solutions of the underlying equations of motion with a prescribed form of their wavefront set and whose anti-symmetric part is proportional to the difference between the advanced and the retarded fundamental solutions. In particular, under a suitable restriction of the class of admissible boundary conditions and setting to zero the mass, we prove their existence extending to the case under scrutiny a deformation argument which is typically used on globally hyperbolic spacetimes with empty boundary.	
 The Shifting Sands of Motivation: Revisiting What Drives Contributors in Open Source	Marco Gerosa,Igor Wiese,Bianca Trinkenreich,Georg Link,Gregorio Robles,Christoph Treude,Igor Steinmacher,,, , Anita Sarma	None	None	Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the last decade, with OSS projects now producing a large ecosystem of popular products, involving industry participation, and providing professional career opportunities. But our field‚Äôs understanding of what motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) the impact of individuals‚Äô personal growth as they become part of OSS communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals‚Äô demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.	
 Transferable Interactiveness Knowledge for Human-Object Interaction Detection	YongLuLi,XinpengLiu,XiaoqianWu,XijieHuang,LiangXu,CewuLu	None	None	Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is an important problem to understand how humans interact with objects. In this paper, we explore interactiveness knowledge which indicates whether a human and an object interact with each other or not. We found that interactiveness knowledge can be learned across HOI datasets and bridge the gap between diverse HOI category settings. Our core idea is to exploit an interactiveness network to learn the general interactiveness knowledge from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression (NIS) before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization ability of interactiveness, interactiveness network is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. We utilize the human instance and body part features together to learn the interactiveness in hierarchical paradigm, i.e., instance-level and body part-level interactivenesses. Thereafter, a consistency task is proposed to guide the learning and extract deeper interactive visual clues. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on HICO-DET, V-COCO, and a newly constructed PaStaNet-HOI dataset. With the learned interactiveness, our method outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection methods, verifying its efficacy and flexibility.

 Statics and Dynamics of Space-Charge-Layers in Polarized Inorganic Solid Electrolytes	Katharina BeckerSteinberger, Simon Schardt, Birger Horstmann, Arnulf Latz	katharina.becker-steinberger@dlr.de	None	The quest for safe high-energy batteries with ‚Äú5V-class‚Äù cathodes and lithium metal anodes drives research into solid electrolytes. However, reasons for the large charge transfer resistances‚Äîthe major bottleneck of all-solid-state batteries‚Äîare still debated. In this article, we explore the processes in incompressible solid electrolytes between blocking electrodes by theory-based continuum modeling and numerical simulations. We investigate the experimentally observed wide space-charge-zones in solid electrolytes, which are a possible cause for the high interfacial resistances. On time scales relevant for battery applications, we reduce our model equations. Analytic and numeric calculations predict and study the actual structure of space-charge-layers in solid electrolytes. To illustrate these dynamics and validate our model, computational results are presented and compared with experimental observations. Analog to semiconductors, we determine the material dependent, asymmetric space-charge-layer width in the low temperature limit approximately. This allows us to make an explicit statement about the influence of defect concentrations and dielectric properties on the width of the space-charge-layers in homogeneous solid electrolytes.	
 Modeling stellar abundance patterns resulting from the addition of earthlike planetary material	Charles Cowley, Donald Bord, Kutluay Yce	None	None	We model the observed precision differential abundance patterns of three G-type dwarfs, assuming a mass of planetary or disk material was added to or subtracted from the atmosphere of the star. The two-parameter model is fit by linear regression. The stellar abundance patterns are corrected for Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). The differential abundances can be highly correlated with the elemental condensation temperature. We show how it is possible to match not only the slope, but the quantitative abundance differences, assuming a composition for the added material equal to that of the bulk earth. We also model the wide pair HIP 34407 and HIP 34426, where GCE corrections are assumed unnecessary. An appendix discusses issues of volatility and condensation temperature.	
 Exploiting Symmetry Reduces the Cost of Training QAOA	Ruslan ShaydulinstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Stefan MWildstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	A promising approach to the practical application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is finding QAOA parameters classically in simulation and sampling the solutions from QAOA with optimized parameters on a quantum computer. Doing so requires repeated evaluations of QAOA energy in simulation. We propose a novel approach for accelerating the evaluation of QAOA energy by leveraging the symmetry of the problem. We show a connection between classical symmetries of the objective function and the symmetries of the terms of the cost Hamiltonian with respect to the QAOA energy. We show how by considering only the terms that are not connected by symmetry, we can significantly reduce the cost of evaluating the QAOA energy. Our approach is general and applies to any known subgroup of symmetries and is not limited to graph problems. Our results are directly applicable to nonlocal QAOA generalization RQAOA. We outline how available fast graph automorphism solvers can be leveraged for computing the symmetries of the problem in practice. We implement the proposed approach on the MaxCut problem using a state-of-the-art tensor network simulator and a graph automorphism solver on a benchmark of 48 graphs with up to 10,000 nodes. Our approach provides an improvement for p = 1 ùëù 1 p=1 italic_p = 1 on 71.7 % percent 71.7 71.7\% 71.7 % of the graphs considered, with a median speedup of 4.06 4.06 4.06 4.06 , on a benchmark where 62.5 % percent 62.5 62.5\% 62.5 % of the graphs are known to be hard for automorphism solvers.	
 Nonequilibrium thermomechanics of Gaussian phase packet crystals: application to the quasistatic quasicontinuum method	Prateek Gupta, Michael Ortiz, Dennis MKochmann	pgupta@ethz.ch	Mechanics & Materials Lab, Department of Mechanical and Process EngineeringETH Z√ºrich, 8092 Z√ºrich, Switzerland	The quasicontinuum (QC) method was originally introduced to bridge across length scales by coarse-graining an atomistic ensemble to significantly larger continuum scales at zero temperature, thus overcoming the crucial length-scale limitation of classical atomic-scale simulation techniques while solely relying on atomic-scale input (in the form of interatomic potentials). An associated challenge lies in bridging across time scales to overcome the time-scale limitations of atomistics at finite temperature . To address the biggest challenge, bridging across both length and time scales, only a few techniques exist, and most of those are limited to conditions of constant temperature. Here, we present a new general strategy for the space-time coarsening of an atomistic ensemble, which introduces thermomechanical coupling. Specifically, we evolve the statistics of an atomistic ensemble in phase space over time by applying the Liouville equation to an approximation of the ensemble‚Äôs probability distribution (which further admits a variational formulation). To this end, we approximate a crystalline solid as a lattice of lumped correlated Gaussian phase packets occupying atomic lattice sites, and we investigate the resulting quasistatics and dynamics of the system . By definition, phase packets account for the dynamics of crystalline lattices at finite temperature through the statistical variances of atomic momenta and positions. We show that momentum-space correlation allows for an exchange between potential and kinetic contributions to the crystal‚Äôs Hamiltonian. Consequently, local adiabatic heating due to atomic site motion is captured. Moreover, in the quasistatic limit, the governing equations reduce to the minimization of thermodynamic potentials (similar to maximum-entropy formulation previously introduced for finite-temperature QC), and they yield the local equation of state, which we derive for isothermal, isobaric, and isentropic conditions. Since our formulation without interatomic correlations precludes irreversible heat transport, we demonstrate its combination with thermal transport models to describe realistic atomic-level processes, and we discuss opportunities for capturing atomic-level thermal transport by including interatomic correlations in the Gaussian phase packet formulation. Overall, our Gaussian phase packet approach offers a promising avenue for finite-temperature non-equilibrium quasicontinuum techniques, which may be combined with thermal transport models and extended to other approximations of the probability distribution as well as to exploit the variational structure.	
 Design and Fabrication of Metamaterial Anti-Reflection Coatings for the Simons Observatory	Joseph Golec, Jeffrey McMahon, Aamir Ali, Grace Chesmore, Leah Cooperrider, Simon Dicker, Nicholas Galitzki, Kathleen Harrington, Rebecca Jackson, Benjamin Westbrook, Edward Wollack, Zhilei Xu, Ningfeng Zhu	None	None	The Simons Observatory (SO) will be a cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey experiment with three small-aperture telescopes and one large-aperture telescope, which will observe from the Atacama Desert in Chile. In total, SO will field over 60,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in six spectral bands centered between 27 and 280 GHz in order to achieve the sensitivity necessary to measure or constrain numerous cosmological quantities, as outlined in The Simons Observatory Collaboration et al. (2019). These telescopes require 33 highly transparent, large aperture, refracting optics. To this end, we developed mechanically robust, highly efficient, metamaterial anti-reflection (AR) coatings with octave bandwidth coverage for silicon optics up to 46 cm in diameter for the 22-55, 75-165, and 190-310 GHz bands. We detail the design, the manufacturing approach to fabricate the SO lenses, their performance, and possible extensions of metamaterial AR coatings to optical elements made of harder materials such as alumina.

 Channel Estimation via Successive Denoising in MIMO OFDM Systems: A Reinforcement Learning Approach	Myeung Suk Oh, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Taejoon Kim, Christopher Brinton and David Love	None	None	In general, reliable communication via multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) requires accurate channel estimation at the receiver. The existing literature largely focuses on denoising methods for channel estimation that depend on either (i) channel analysis in the time-domain with prior channel knowledge or (ii) supervised learning techniques which require large pre-labeled datasets for training. To address these limitations, we present a frequency-domain denoising method based on a reinforcement learning framework that does not need a priori channel knowledge and pre-labeled data. Our methodology includes a new successive channel denoising process based on channel curvature computation, for which we obtain a channel curvature magnitude threshold to identify unreliable channel estimates. Based on this process, we formulate the denoising mechanism as a Markov decision process, where we define the actions through a geometry-based channel estimation update, and the reward function based on a policy that reduces mean squared error (MSE). We then resort to Q-learning to update the channel estimates. Numerical results verify that our denoising algorithm can successfully mitigate noise in channel estimates. In particular, our algorithm provides a significant improvement over the practical least squares (LS) estimation method and provides performance that approaches that of the ideal linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation with perfect knowledge of channel statistics.	
 Fractional boundary charges with quantized slopes in interacting one- and two-dimensional systems	Katharina Laubscher, Clara Weber, Dante Kennes, Mikhail Pletyukhov, Herbert Schoeller, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja	None	None	We study fractional boundary charges (FBCs) for two classes of strongly interacting systems. First, we study strongly interacting nanowires subjected to a periodic potential with a period that is a rational fraction of the Fermi wavelength. For sufficiently strong interactions, the periodic potential leads to the opening of a charge density wave gap at the Fermi level. The FBC then depends linearly on the phase offset of the potential with a quantized slope determined by the period. Furthermore, different possible values for the FBC at a fixed phase offset label different degenerate ground states of the system that cannot be connected adiabatically. Next, we turn to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at odd filling factors ŒΩ = 1 / ( 2 l + 1 ) ùúà 1 2 ùëô 1 \nu=1/(2l+1) italic_ŒΩ = 1 / ( 2 italic_l + 1 ) , where l ùëô l italic_l is an integer. For a Corbino disk threaded by an external flux, we find that the FBC depends linearly on the flux with a quantized slope that is determined by the filling factor. Again, the FBC has 2 l + 1 2 ùëô 1 2l+1 2 italic_l + 1 different branches that cannot be connected adiabatically, reflecting the ( 2 l + 1 ) 2 ùëô 1 (2l+1) ( 2 italic_l + 1 ) -fold degeneracy of the ground state. These results allow for several promising and strikingly simple ways to probe strongly interacting phases via boundary charge measurements.

To get the solution, we employ the Ernst magnetization to the Reissner-Nordstrom-Taub-NUT spacetime as the seed. After discussing some physical aspects of the spacetime, we show that the extremal entropy of a magnetized Reissner-Nordstrom-Taub-NUT black hole can be reproduced by using the Cardy formula.

 Accumulating Risk Capital Through Investing in Cooperation	Charlotte Roman, Michael Dennis, Andrew Critch, Stuart Russell	c.d.roman@warwick.ac.uk, michael_dennis,critch,russell@cs.berkeley.edu	None	Recent work on promoting cooperation in multi-agent learning has resulted in many methods which successfully promote cooperation at the cost of becoming more vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors. We show that this is an unavoidable trade-off and propose an objective which balances these concerns, promoting both safety and long-term cooperation. Moreover, the trade-off between safety and cooperation is not severe, and you can receive exponentially large returns through cooperation from a small amount of risk. We study both an exact solution method and propose a method for training policies that targets this objective, Accumulating Risk Capital Through Investing in Cooperation (ARCTIC), and evaluate them in iterated Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma and Stag Hunt.	
 Weave Realizability for limit-fromùê∑-type	James Hughes	None	None	We study exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian links of D n subscript ùê∑ ùëõ D_{n} italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -type in the standard contact 3-sphere. The main result is the existence of a Lagrangian filling, represented by a weave, such that any algebraic quiver mutation of the associated intersection quiver can be realized as a geometric weave mutation. The method of proof is via Legendrian weave calculus and a construction of appropriate 1-cycles whose geometric intersections realize the required algebraic intersection numbers. In particular, we show that in D ùê∑ D italic_D -type, each cluster chart of the moduli of microlocal rank-1 sheaves is induced by at least one embedded exact Lagrangian filling. Hence, the Legendrian links of D n subscript ùê∑ ùëõ D_{n} italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -type have at least as many Hamiltonian isotopy classes of Lagrangian fillings as cluster seeds in the D n subscript ùê∑ ùëõ D_{n} italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -type cluster algebra, and their geometric exchange graph for Lagrangian disk surgeries contains the cluster exchange graph of D n subscript ùê∑ ùëõ D_{n} italic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -type.	
 Testing Scalable Bell Inequalities for Quantum Graph States on IBM Quantum Devices	Bo YangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Rudy RaymondstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hiroshi ImaistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hyungseok ChangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hidefumi HiraishistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Testing and verifying imperfect multi-qubit quantum devices are important as such noisy quantum devices are widely available today. Bell inequalities are known useful for testing and verifying the quality of the quantum devices from their nonlocal quantum states and local measurements. There have been many experiments demonstrating the violations of Bell inequalities but they are limited in the number of qubits and the types of quantum states. We report violations of Bell inequalities on IBM Quantum devices based on the scalable and robust inequalities maximally violated by graph states as proposed by Baccari et al. (Ref. [ 1 ] ). The violations are obtained from the quantum states of path graphs up to 57 and 21 qubits on the 65-qubit and 27-qubit IBM Quantum devices, respectively, and from those of star graphs up to 8 and 7 qubits with error mitigation on the same devices. We are able to show violations of the inequalities on various graph states by constructing low-depth quantum circuits producing them, and by applying the readout error mitigation technique. We also point out that quantum circuits for star graph states of size N ùëÅ N italic_N can be realized with circuits of depth O ( N ) ùëÇ ùëÅ O(\sqrt{N}) italic_O ( square-root start_ARG italic_N end_ARG ) on subdivided honeycomb lattices which are the topology of the 65-qubit IBM Quantum device. Our experiments show encouraging results on the ability of existing quantum devices to prepare entangled quantum states, and provide experimental evidences on the benefit of scalable Bell inequalities for testing them.	
 Detection of Bidirectional System-Environment Information Exchanges	Adrin Budini	None	None	Quantum memory effects can be related to a bidirectional exchange of information between an open system and its environment, which in turn modifies the state and dynamical behavior of the last one. Nevertheless, non-Markovianity can also be induced by environments whose dynamics is not affected during the system evolution, implying the absence of any physical information exchange. An unsolved open problem in the formulation of quantum memory measures is the apparent impossibility of discerning between both paradigmatic cases. Here, we present an operational scheme that, based on the outcomes of successive measurements processes performed over the system of interest, allows to distinguishing between both kinds of memory effects. The method accurately detects bidirectional information flows in diverse dissipative and dephasing non-Markovian open system dynamics.

 1 Introduction			None	We derive from the subleading contributions to the chiral three-nucleon interaction [published in Phys. Rev. C77, 064004 (2008) and Phys. Rev. C84, 054001 (2011)] their first-order contributions to the energy per particle of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter in an analytical way. For the variety of short-range and long-range terms that constitute the subleading chiral 3N-force the pertinent closed 3-ring, 2-ring, and 1-ring diagrams are evaluated. While 3-ring diagrams vanish by a spin-trace and the results for 2-ring diagrams can be given in terms of elementary functions of the ratio Fermi-momentum over pion mass, one ends up in most cases for the closed 1-ring diagrams with one-parameter integrals. The same treatment is applied to the subsubleading chiral three-nucleon interactions as far as these have been constructed up to now.

In this paper, we show some results of weak quasi-factorization for the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy, i.e. upper bounds for the BS-entropy between two bipartite states in terms of the sum of two conditional BS-entropies, up to some multiplicative and additive factors.

 Ricci de Turck flow on incomplete manifolds	Tobias Marxen, Boris Vertman	None	None	In this paper we construct a Ricci de Turck flow on any incomplete Riemannian manifold with bounded curvature. The central property of the flow is that it stays uniformly equivalent to the initial incomplete Riemannian metric, and in that sense preserves any given initial singularity structure. Together with the corresponding result by Shi for complete manifolds [ Shi89 ] , this gives that any (complete or incomplete) manifold of bounded curvature can be evolved by the Ricci de Turck flow for a short time.	
 2-generated axial algebras of Monster type	Clara Franchi, Mario Mainardis, Sergey Shpectorov	None	None	In this paper we provide the basic setup for a project, initiated by Felix Rehren in [ 16 ] , aiming at classifying all 2 2 2 2 -generated primitive axial agebras of Monster type ( Œ± , Œ≤ ) ùõº ùõΩ (\alpha,\beta) ( italic_Œ± , italic_Œ≤ ) . We first revise Rehren‚Äôs construction of an initial object in the cathegory of primitive n ùëõ n italic_n -generated axial algebras giving a formal one, filling some gaps and, though correcting some inaccuracies, confirm Rehren‚Äôs results. Then we focus on 2 2 2 2 -generated algebras which naturally part into three cases: the two critical cases Œ± = 2 Œ≤ ùõº 2 ùõΩ \alpha=2\beta italic_Œ± = 2 italic_Œ≤ and Œ± = 4 Œ≤ ùõº 4 ùõΩ \alpha=4\beta italic_Œ± = 4 italic_Œ≤ , and the generic case (i.e. all the rest). About these cases, which will be dealt in detail in subsequent papers, we give bounds on the dimensions (the generic case already treated by Rehen) and classify all 2-generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type ( Œ± , Œ≤ ) ùõº ùõΩ (\alpha,\beta) ( italic_Œ± , italic_Œ≤ ) over ‚Ñö ( Œ± , Œ≤ ) ‚Ñö ùõº ùõΩ {\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha,\beta) blackboard_Q ( italic_Œ± , italic_Œ≤ ) for Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± and Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ algebraically independent indeterminates over ‚Ñö ‚Ñö {\mathbb{Q}} blackboard_Q . Finally we restrict to the 2 2 2 2 -generated Majorana algebras (i.e. when Œ± = 1 4 ùõº 1 4 \alpha=\frac{1}{4} italic_Œ± = divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 end_ARG and Œ≤ = 1 32 ùõΩ 1 32 \beta=\frac{1}{32} italic_Œ≤ = divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 32 end_ARG ), showing that these fall precisely into the nine isomorphism types of the Norton-Sakuma algebras.

 Terminus: A Versatile Simulator for Space-based Telescopes	Billy Edwards, Ian Stotesbury	None	None	Space-based telescopes offer unparalleled opportunities for characterising exoplanets, Solar System bodies and stellar objects. However, observatories in low Earth orbits (e.g. Hubble, CHEOPS, Twinkle and an ever increasing number of cubesats) cannot always be continuously pointed at a target due to Earth obscuration. For exoplanet observations consisting of transit, or eclipse, spectroscopy this causes gaps in the light curve, which reduces the information content and can diminish the science return of the observation. Terminus, a time-domain simulator, has been developed to model the occurrence of these gaps to predict the potential impact on future observations. The simulator is capable of radiometrically modelling exoplanet observations as well as producing light curves and spectra. Here, Terminus is baselined on the Twinkle mission but the model can be adapted for any space-based telescope and is especially applicable to those in a low-Earth orbit. Terminus also has the capability to model observations of other targets such as asteroids or brown dwarfs.	
 Multi-Time Attention Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series	Satya Narayan Shukla Benjamin MarlinCollege of Information and Computer SciencesUniversity of Massachusetts AmherstAmherst, MA , USA	None	None	Irregular sampling occurs in many time series modeling applications where it presents a significant challenge to standard deep learning models. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework for this setting that we call Multi-Time Attention Networks . Multi-Time Attention Networks learn an embedding of continuous time values and use an attention mechanism to produce a fixed-length representation of a time series containing a variable number of observations. We investigate the performance of this framework on interpolation and classification tasks using multiple datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach performs as well or better than a range of baseline and recently proposed models while offering significantly faster training times than current state-of-the-art methods. 1 1 1 Implementation available at : https://github.com/reml-lab/mTAN

 Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks	Jiaxuan You, Jonathan GomesSelman, Rex Ying, Jure Leskovec	None	None	Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful modeling framework for relational data. However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d ùëë d italic_d -regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs) , with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes‚Äô identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing , where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks. Additionally, ID-GNNs demonstrate improved or comparable performance over other task-specific graph networks.

 Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Massive Connectivity	Shuhao Xia,Yuanming Shi,Yong Zhou,and Xiaojun Yuan	None	None	With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), massive machine-type communication has become a promising application scenario, where a large number of devices transmit sporadically to a base station (BS). Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently proposed as an innovative new technology to achieve energy efficiency and coverage enhancement by establishing favorable signal propagation environments, thereby improving data transmission in massive connectivity. Nevertheless, the BS needs to detect active devices and estimate channels to support data transmission in RIS-assisted massive access systems, which yields unique challenges. This paper shall consider an RIS-assisted uplink IoT network and aims to solve the RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem, where the BS detects the active devices and estimates the separated channels of the RIS-to-device link and the RIS-to-BS link. Due to limited scattering between the RIS and the BS, we model the RIS-to-BS channel as a sparse channel. As a result, by simultaneously exploiting both the sparsity of sporadic transmission in massive connectivity and the RIS-to-BS channels, we formulate the RIS-related activity detection and channel estimation problem as a sparse matrix factorization problem. Furthermore, we develop an approximate message passing (AMP) based algorithm to solve the problem based on Bayesian inference framework and reduce the computational complexity by approximating the algorithm with the central limit theorem and Taylor series arguments. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed algorithm.

Furthermore, we would like to propose new notations for type-2 fuzzy theory where symbols tend to be complicated and misleading. In particular, the Hukuhara differential symbols introduced experimentally in this paper will give us clearler meanings and expressions.	
 Regularization by dynamic programming	Stefan Kindermann, Leito	None	None	We investigate continuous regularization methods for linear inverse problems of static and dynamic type. These methods are based on dynamic programming approaches for linear quadratic optimal control problems. We prove regularization properties and also obtain rates of convergence for our methods. A numerical example concerning a dynamical electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem is used to illustrate the theoretical results.

 X-Ray Emission from the PeVatron-candidate Supernova Remnant G106.3+2.7	Yutaka Fujita, Aya Bamba, Kumiko Nobukawa, Hironori Matsumoto	None	None	We report the discovery of diffuse X-ray emission around the supernova remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7, which is associated with VER J2227+608 and HAWC J2227+610 and is known as a candidate for a PeV cosmic-ray accelerator (PeVatron). We analyze observational data of Suzaku around the SNR and the adjacent pulsar PSR J2229+6114. We find diffuse X-ray emission that is represented by either thermal or nonthermal processes. However, the metal abundance for the thermal emission is < 0.13 Z ‚òâ absent 0.13 subscript ùëç ‚òâ <0.13\>Z_{\sun} < 0.13 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚òâ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , which may be too small in the Milky Way and suggests that the emission is nonthermal. The intensity of the diffuse emission increases toward PSR J2229+6114 in the same way as radio emission, and it is in contrast with gamma-ray emission concentrated on a molecular cloud. The X-ray photon index does not change with the distance from the pulsar and it indicates that radiative cooling is ineffective and particle diffusion is not extremely slow. The X-ray and radio emissions seem to be of leptonic origin and the parent electrons may originate from the pulsar. The gamma-ray emission appears to be of hadronic origin because of its spatial distribution. The parent protons may be tightly confined in the cloud separately from the diffusing electrons.	
 Breakdown of chiral perturbation theory for the axion hot dark matter bound	Luca Di Luzio, Guido Martinelli, Gioacchino Piazza	luca.diluzio@desy.de	None	We show that the commonly adopted hot dark matter (HDM) bound on the axion mass m a ‚â≤ less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùëö ùëé absent m_{a}\lesssim italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 1 eV is not reliable, since it is obtained by extrapolating the chiral expansion in a region where the effective field theory breaks down. This is explicitly shown via the calculation of the axion-pion thermalization rate at the next-to-leading order in chiral perturbation theory. We finally advocate a strategy for a sound extraction of the axion HDM bound via lattice QCD techniques.	
 Multi-angle reconstruction of domain morphology with all-optical diamond magnetometry	Lucio Stefan, Anthony Tan, Baptiste Vindolet, Michael Hgen, Dickson Thian, Hang Khume Tan, Loc Rondin, Helena Knowles, JeanFranois Roch, Anjan Soumyanarayanan, Mete Atatre	lucio.stefan@nbi.ku.dk	None	Scanning diamond magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance of the nitrogen-vacancy centre offer very high sensitivity and non-invasive imaging capabilities when the stray fields emanating from ultrathin magnetic materials are sufficiently low ( < 10 mT absent 10 mT <10\,\mathrm{mT} < 10 roman_mT ). Beyond this low-field regime, the optical signal quenches and a quantitative measurement is challenging. While the field-dependent NV photoluminescence can still provide qualitative information on magnetic morphology, this operation regime remains unexplored particularly for surface magnetisation larger than ‚àº 3 mA similar-to absent 3 mA \sim 3\,\mathrm{mA} ‚àº 3 roman_mA . Here, we introduce a multi-angle reconstruction technique (MARe) that captures the full nanoscale domain morphology in all magnetic-field regimes leading to NV photoluminescence quench. To demonstrate this, we use [Ir/Co/Pt] 14 14 {}_{14} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT multilayer films with surface magnetisation an order of magnitude larger than previous reports. Our approach brings non-invasive nanoscale magnetic field imaging capability to the study of a wider pool of magnetic materials and phenomena.	
 Emergent moments in a Hund‚Äôs impurity	Victor DrouinTouchette, Elio Knig, Yashar Komijani, Piers Coleman	None	None	Motivated by the relevance of Hund‚Äôs coupling in the context of multiorbital superconductors, we revisit the problem of a multiorbital Kondo impurity with Hund‚Äôs interaction. Using dynamical large-N techniques, we propose an efficient approach that retains the essential physics at play, while providing a pathway to scalable quantum impurity solvers. We are able to follow the ground state, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of this system over many decades of temperature. Our approach captures the emergence of large moments, and follows the stretched evolution of the physics down to their exponentially suppressed Kondo temperature. We focus our analysis on the intermediate finite temperature phase which presents an alternate paramagnetic state due to the emergent moment, and discuss the relevance of this regime to Hund‚Äôs metals.	
 Radial Gradients in Dust-to-Gas Ratio Lead to Preferred Region for Giant Planet Formation	Yayaati Chachan, Eve Lee, Heather Knutson	None	None	The Rosseland mean opacity of dust in protoplanetary disks is often calculated assuming the interstellar medium (ISM) size distribution and a constant dust-to-gas ratio. However, the dust size distribution and the dust-to-gas ratio in protoplanetary disks are distinct from those of the ISM. Here, we use simple dust evolution models that incorporate grain growth and transport to calculate the time evolution of mean opacity of dust grains as a function of distance from the star. Dust dynamics and size distribution are sensitive to the assumed value of the turbulence strength Œ± t subscript ùõº t \alpha_{\rm t} italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the velocity at which grains fragment v frag subscript ùë£ frag v_{\mathrm{frag}} italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_frag end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . For moderate-to-low turbulence strengths of Œ± t ‚â≤ 10 ‚àí 3 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùõº t superscript 10 3 \alpha_{\mathrm{t}}\lesssim 10^{-3} italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and substantial differences in v frag subscript ùë£ frag v_{\mathrm{frag}} italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_frag end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for icy and ice-free grains, we find a spatially non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size distribution that deviate significantly from the ISM values, in agreement with previous studies. The effect of a non-uniform dust-to-gas ratio on the Rosseland mean opacity dominates over that of the size distribution. This spatially varying‚Äîthat is non-monotonic‚Äîdust-to-gas ratio creates a region in the protoplanetary disk that is optimal for producing hydrogen-rich planets, potentially explaining the apparent peak in gas giant planet occurrence rate at intermediate distances. The enhanced dust-to-gas ratio within the ice line also suppresses gas accretion rates onto sub-Neptune cores, thus stifling their tendency to undergo runaway gas accretion within disk lifetimes. Finally, our work corroborates the idea that low mass cores with large primordial gaseous envelopes (‚Äòsuper-puffs‚Äô) originate beyond the ice line.	
 A No-Lose Theorem for Discovering the New Physics of (ùëî-2)_ùúá at Muon Colliders	Rodolfo Capdevilla, David Curtin, Yonatan Kahn, Gordan Krnjaic	None	None	We perform a model-exhaustive analysis of all possible beyond Standard Model (BSM) solutions to the ( g ‚àí 2 ) Œº subscript ùëî 2 ùúá (g-2)_{\mu} ( italic_g - 2 ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT anomaly to study production of the associated new states at future muon colliders, and formulate a no-lose theorem for the discovery of new physics if the anomaly is confirmed and weakly coupled solutions below the GeV scale are excluded. Our goal is to find the highest possible mass scale of new physics subject only to perturbative unitarity, and optionally the requirements of minimum flavour violation (MFV) and/or naturalness. We prove that a 3 TeV muon collider is guaranteed to discover all BSM scenarios in which Œî a Œº Œî subscript ùëé ùúá \Delta a_{\mu} roman_Œî italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is generated by SM singlets with masses above ‚àº GeV similar-to absent GeV \sim\operatorname{GeV} ‚àº roman_GeV ; lighter singlets will be discovered by upcoming low-energy experiments. If new states with electroweak quantum numbers contribute to ( g ‚àí 2 ) Œº subscript ùëî 2 ùúá (g-2)_{\mu} ( italic_g - 2 ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , the minimal requirements of perturbative unitarity guarantee new charged states below ùí™ ( 100 TeV ) ùí™ 100 TeV \mathcal{O}(100\operatorname{TeV}) caligraphic_O ( 100 roman_TeV ) , but this is strongly disfavoured by stringent constraints on charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decays. Reasonable BSM theories that satisfy CLFV bounds by obeying Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) and avoid generating two new hierarchy problems require the existence of at least one new charged state below ‚àº 10 TeV similar-to absent 10 TeV \sim 10\operatorname{TeV} ‚àº 10 roman_TeV . This strongly motivates the construction of high-energy muon colliders, which are guaranteed to discover new physics: either by producing these new charged states directly, or by setting a strong lower bound on their mass, which would empirically prove that the universe is fine-tuned and violates the assumptions of MFV while somehow not generating large CLFVs. The former case is obviously the desired outcome, but the latter scenario would perhaps teach us even more about the universe by profoundly revising our understanding of naturalness, cosmological vacuum selection, and the SM flavour puzzle.	
 Fractionalized quantum criticality in spin-orbital liquids from field theory beyond the leading order	Shouryya Ray, Bernhard Ihrig, Daniel Kruti, John AGracey, MichaelMScherer, Lukas Janssen	None	None	Two-dimensional spin-orbital magnets with strong exchange frustration have recently been predicted to facilitate the realization of a quantum critical point in the Gross-Neveu-SO(3) universality class. In contrast to previously known Gross-Neveu-type universality classes, this quantum critical point separates a Dirac semimetal and a long-range-ordered phase, in which the fermion spectrum is only partially gapped out. Here, we characterize the quantum critical behavior of the Gross-Neveu-SO(3) universality class by employing three complementary field-theoretical techniques beyond their leading orders. We compute the correlation-length exponent ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ , the order-parameter anomalous dimension Œ∑ œï subscript ùúÇ italic-œï \eta_{\phi} italic_Œ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œï end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and the fermion anomalous dimension Œ∑ œà subscript ùúÇ ùúì \eta_{\psi} italic_Œ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œà end_POSTSUBSCRIPT using a three-loop œµ italic-œµ \epsilon italic_œµ expansion around the upper critical space-time dimension of four, a second-order large- N ùëÅ N italic_N expansion (with the fermion anomalous dimension obtained even at the third order), as well as a functional renormalization group approach in the improved local potential approximation. For the physically relevant case of N = 3 ùëÅ 3 N=3 italic_N = 3 flavors of two-component Dirac fermions in 2+1 space-time dimensions, we obtain the estimates 1 / ŒΩ = 1.03 ( 15 ) 1 ùúà 1.03 15 1/\nu=1.03(15) 1 / italic_ŒΩ = 1.03 ( 15 ) , Œ∑ œï = 0.42 ( 7 ) subscript ùúÇ italic-œï 0.42 7 \eta_{\phi}=0.42(7) italic_Œ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œï end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.42 ( 7 ) , and Œ∑ œà = 0.180 ( 10 ) subscript ùúÇ ùúì 0.180 10 \eta_{\psi}=0.180(10) italic_Œ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œà end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.180 ( 10 ) from averaging over the results of the different techniques, with the displayed uncertainty representing the degree of consistency among the three methods.	
 Randomness of M√∂bius coefficents and Brownian Motion: Growth of the Mertens Function and the Riemann Hypothesis	Giuseppe Mussardo, Andr LeClair	None	None	The validity of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) on the location of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Œ∂ ùúÅ \zeta italic_Œ∂ -function is directly related to the growth of the Mertens function M ( x ) = ‚àë k = 1 x Œº ( k ) ùëÄ ùë• superscript subscript ùëò 1 ùë• ùúá ùëò M(x)\,=\,\sum_{k=1}^{x}\mu(k) italic_M ( italic_x ) = ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œº ( italic_k ) , where Œº ( k ) ùúá ùëò \mu(k) italic_Œº ( italic_k ) is the M√∂bius coefficient of the integer k ùëò k italic_k : the RH is indeed true if the Mertens function goes asymptotically as M ( x ) ‚àº x 1 / 2 + œµ similar-to ùëÄ ùë• superscript ùë• 1 2 italic-œµ M(x)\sim x^{1/2+\epsilon} italic_M ( italic_x ) ‚àº italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 + italic_œµ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , where œµ italic-œµ \epsilon italic_œµ is an arbitrary strictly positive quantity. We argue that this behavior can be established on the basis of a new probabilistic approach based on the global properties of Mertens function, namely, based on reorganizing globally in distinct blocks the terms of its series. To this aim, we focus the attention on the square-free numbers and we derive a series of probabilistic results concerning the prime number distribution along the series of square-free numbers, the average number of prime divisors, the Erd≈ës-Kac theorem for square-free numbers, etc. These results point to the conclusion that the Mertens function is subject to a normal distribution as much as any other random walk. We also present an argument in favor of the thesis that the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis also implies the validity of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for the Dirichlet L ùêø L italic_L -functions. Next we study the local properties of the Mertens function, i.e. its variation induced by each M√∂bius coefficient restricted to the square-free numbers. Motivated by the natural curiosity to see how close to a purely random walk is any sub-sequence extracted by the sequence of the M√∂bius coefficients for the square-free numbers, we perform a massive statistical analysis on these coefficients, applying to them a series of randomness tests of increasing precision and complexity: together with several frequency tests within a block, the list of our tests include those for the longest run of ones in a block, the binary matrix rank test, the Discrete Fourier Transform test, the non-overlapping template matching test, the entropy test, the cumulative sum test, the random excursion tests, etc. for a total number of eighteen different tests. The successful outputs of all these tests (each of them with a level of confidence of 99 % percent 99 99\% 99 % that all the sub-sequences analyzed are indeed random) can be seen as impressive ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù confirmations of the brownian nature of the restricted M√∂bius coefficients and the probabilistic normal law distribution of the Mertens function analytically established earlier. In view of the theoretical probabilistic argument and the large battery of statistical tests, we can conclude that while a violation of the RH is strictly speaking not impossible, it is however extremely improbable.	
 Extracting Dark-Matter Velocities from Halo Masses: A Reconstruction Conjecture	Keith Dienes, Fei Huang, Jeff Kost, Kevin Manogue, Brooks Thomas	dienes@email.arizona.edu	None	Increasing attention has recently focused on non-traditional dark-matter production mechanisms which result in primordial dark-matter velocity distributions with highly non-thermal shapes. In this paper, we undertake an assessment of how the detailed shape of a general dark-matter velocity distribution impacts structure formation in the non-linear regime. In particular, we investigate the impact on the halo-mass and subhalo-mass functions, as well as on astrophysical observables such as satellite and cluster-number counts. We find that many of the standard expectations no longer hold in situations in which this velocity distribution takes a highly non-trivial, even multi-modal shape. For example, we find that the nominal free-streaming scale alone becomes insufficient to characterize the effect of free-streaming on structure formation. In addition, we propose a simple one-line conjecture which can be used to ‚Äúreconstruct‚Äù the primordial dark-matter velocity distribution directly from the shape of the halo-mass function. Although our conjecture is completely heuristic, we show that it successfully reproduces the salient features of the underlying dark-matter velocity distribution even for non-trivial distributions which are highly non-thermal and/or multi-modal, such as might occur for non-minimal dark sectors. Moreover, since our approach relies only on the halo-mass function, our conjecture provides a method of probing dark-matter properties even for scenarios in which the dark and visible sectors interact only gravitationally.	
 Detecting Dark Matter with Far-Forward Emulsion and Liquid Argon Detectors at the LHC	BrianBatell, JonathanLFeng, Sebastian Trojanowski	batell@pitt.edu	None	New light particles may be produced in large numbers in the far-forward region at the LHC and then decay to dark matter, which can be detected through its scattering in far-forward experiments. We consider the example of invisibly-decaying dark photons, which decay to dark matter through A ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí œá œá ‚Üí superscript ùê¥ ‚Ä≤ ùúí ùúí A^{\prime}\to\chi\chi italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Üí italic_œá italic_œá .

We consider the discovery potential of detectors placed on the beam collision axis 480 m from the ATLAS interaction point, including an emulsion detector (FASER ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ 2) and, for the first time, a Forward Liquid Argon Experiment (FLArE). For each of these detector technologies, we devise cuts that effectively separate the single e ‚àí superscript ùëí e^{-} italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT signal from the leading neutrino- and muon-induced backgrounds. We find that 10- to 100-tonne detectors may detect hundreds to thousands of dark matter events in the HL-LHC era and will sensitively probe the thermal relic region of parameter space. These results motivate the construction of far-forward emulsion and liquid argon detectors at the LHC, as well as a suitable location to accommodate them, such as the proposed Forward Physics Facility.	
 The Cosmology of Quadratic Torsionful Gravity	Damianos IosifidisaststartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Lucrezia Ravera,dagger,starstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	diosifid@auth.gr, lucrezia.ravera@polito.it	None	We study the cosmology of a quadratic metric-compatible torsionful gravity theory in the presence of a perfect hyperfluid. The gravitational action is an extension of the Einstein-Cartan theory given by the usual Einstein-Hilbert contribution plus all the admitted quadratic parity even torsion scalars and the matter action also exhibits a dependence on the connection. The equations of motion are obtained by regarding the metric and the metric-compatible torsionful connection as independent variables. We then consider a Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker background, analyze the conservation laws, and derive the torsion modified Friedmann equations for our theory. Remarkably, we are able to provide exact analytic solutions for the torsionful cosmology.	
 Extreme-Value Distributions and Primordial Black-Hole Formation	Florian Khnel, Dominik JSchwarz	Florian.Kuehnel@physik.uni-muenchen.de	None	We argue that primordial black-hole formation must be described by means of extreme-value theory. This is a consequence of the large values of the energy density required to initiate the collapse of black holes in the early Universe and the finite duration of their collapse. Compared to the Gau√üian description of the most extreme primordial density fluctuations, the holes‚Äô mass function is narrower and peaks towards larger masses. Secondly, thanks to the shallower fall-off of extreme-value distributions, the predicted abundance of primordial black holes is boosted by 10 7 superscript 10 7 10^{7} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT orders of magnitude when extrapolating the observed nearly scale-free power spectrum of the cosmic large-scale structure to primordial black-hole mass scales.	
 The Extended Habitable Epoch of the Universe for Liquids Other than Water	Manasvi Lingam, Abraham Loeb	None	None	At high redshifts, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was higher than its value today. We explore the possibility that life may have arisen early because the higher CMB temperature would have supplied the requisite energy for the existence of different solvents on the surfaces of objects. At redshifts of z ‚â≤ 70 less-than-or-similar-to ùëß 70 z\lesssim 70 italic_z ‚â≤ 70 , after the first stars are predicted to have formed, a number of molecules (but not water) might have existed in liquid form over intervals of ‚àº 10 similar-to absent 10 \sim 10 ‚àº 10 Myr to ‚àº 100 similar-to absent 100 \sim 100 ‚àº 100 Myr. We delineate the challenges and prospects for life in the high-redshift Universe, and assess the various candidates for alternative biochemistries in this context ‚Äì of the options considered herein, we conclude that ethane is probably the most promising contender.	
 Universal Features of Higher-Form Symmetries at Phase Transitions	XiaoChuan Wu, ChaoMing Jian, Cenke Xu	None	None	We investigate the behavior of higher-form symmetries at various quantum phase transitions.

 Where binary neutron stars merge: predictions from IllustrisTNG	Jonah Rose, Paul Torrey, KH Lee, Bartos	None	None	The rate and location of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers are determined by a combination of the star formation history and the Delay Time Distribution (DTD) function. In this paper, we couple the star formation rate histories (SFRHs) from the IllustrisTNG model to a series of varied assumptions for the BNS DTD to make predictions for the BNS merger host galaxy mass function. These predictions offer two outcomes: (i) in the near term: influence BNS merger event follow-up strategy by scrutinizing where most BNS merger events are expected to occur and (ii) in the long term: constrain the DTD for BNS merger events once the host galaxy mass function is observationally well determined. From our fiducial model analysis, we predict that 50% of BNS mergers will occur in host galaxies with stellar mass between 10 10 ‚àí 10 11 superscript 10 10 superscript 10 11 10^{10}-10^{11} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , 68% between 4 √ó 10 9 ‚àí 3 √ó 10 11 4 superscript 10 9 3 superscript 10 11 4\times 10^{9}-3\times 10^{11} 4 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and 95% between 4 √ó 10 8 ‚àí 2 √ó 10 12 4 superscript 10 8 2 superscript 10 12 4\times 10^{8}-2\times 10^{12} 4 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 2 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . We find that the details of the DTD employed does not have a strong effect on the peak of the host mass function. However, varying the DTD provides enough spread that the true DTD can be determined from enough electromagnetic observations of BNS mergers. Knowing the true DTD can help us determine the prevalence of BNS systems formed through highly eccentric and short separation fast-merging channels and can constrain the dominant source of r-process material.	
 A simple model for mixing and cooling in cloud-wind interactions	Matthew Abruzzo, Greg Bryan, Drummond Fielding	None	None	We introduce a simple entropy-based formalism to characterize the role of mixing in pressure-balanced multiphase clouds, and demonstrate example applications using enzo-e (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Under this formalism, the high-dimensional description of the system‚Äôs state at a given time is simplified to the joint distribution of mass over pressure ( P ùëÉ P italic_P ) and entropy ( K = P œÅ ‚àí Œ≥ ùêæ ùëÉ superscript ùúå ùõæ K=P\rho^{-\gamma} italic_K = italic_P italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œ≥ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). As a result, this approach provides a way for (empirically and analytically) quantifying the impact of different initial conditions and sets of physics on the system evolution. We find that mixing predominantly alters the distribution along the K ùêæ K italic_K direction and illustrate how the formalism can be used to model mixing and cooling for fluid elements originating in the cloud. We further confirm and generalize a previously suggested criterion for cloud growth in the presence of radiative cooling, and demonstrate that the shape of the cooling curve, particularly at the low temperature end, can play an important role in controlling condensation. Moreover, we discuss the capacity of our approach to generalize such a criterion to apply to additional sets of physics, and to build intuition for the impact of subtle higher order effects not directly addressed by the criterion.

Our H i image is sensitive to 1.4 √ó \times √ó 10 19 19 {}^{19} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 19 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT atoms cm ‚àí 2 2 {}^{-2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT over 44.1 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT , where we detect H i in 10 galaxies and a total of (1.12 ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 0.02) √ó \times √ó 10 9 9 {}^{9} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT of H i in the intra-group medium (IGM). We search for signs of pre-processing in the 12 group galaxies with confirmed optical redshifts that reside within the sensitivity limit of our H i image. There are 9 galaxies that show evidence of pre-processing and we classify each galaxy into their respective pre-processing category, according to their H i morphology and gas (atomic and molecular) scaling relations. Galaxies that have not yet experienced pre-processing have extended H i discs and a high H i content with a H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT -to-H i ratio that is an order of magnitude lower than the median for their stellar mass. Galaxies that are currently being pre-processed display H i tails, truncated H i discs with typical gas fractions, and H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT -to-H i ratios. Galaxies in the advanced stages of pre-processing are the most H i deficient. If there is any H i , they have lost their outer H i disc and efficiently converted their H i to H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , resulting in H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT -to-H i ratios that are an order of magnitude higher than the median for their stellar mass.

We also detect giant ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 100 kpc) ionised hydrogen (H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± ) filaments in the IGM, likely from cool gas being removed (and subsequently ionised) from an in-falling satellite. The H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± filaments are situated within the hot halo of NGC 1316 and there are localised regions that contain H i . We speculate that the H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± and multiphase gas is supported by magnetic pressure (possibly assisted by the NGC 1316 AGN), such that the hot gas can condense and form H i that survives in the hot halo for cosmological timescales.	
 Heavy elements unveil the non primordial origin of the giant HI ring in Leo	Edvige Corbelli, Giovanni Cresci, Filippo Mannucci, David Thilker, Giacomo Venturi	None	None	The origin and fate of the most extended extragalactic neutral cloud known in the Local Universe, the Leo ring, is still debated 38 years after its discovery. Its existence is alternatively attributed to leftover primordial gas with some low level of metal pollution versus enriched gas stripped during a galaxy-galaxy encounter. Taking advantage of MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) operating at the VLT, we performed optical integral field spectroscopy of 3 HI clumps in the Leo ring where ultraviolet continuum emission has been found. We detected, for the first time, ionized hydrogen in the ring and identify 4 nebular regions powered by massive stars. These nebulae show several metal lines ([OIII], [NII], [SII]) which allowed reliable measures of metallicities, found to be close to or above the solar value (0.8 ‚â§ Z / Z ‚äô ‚â§ absent ùëç subscript ùëç direct-product absent \leq Z/Z_{\odot}\leq ‚â§ italic_Z / italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â§ 1.4). Given the faintness of the diffuse stellar counterparts, less than 3 % percent \% % of the observed heavy elements could have been produced locally in the main body of the ring and not much more than 15 % percent \% % in the HI clump towards M 96. This inference, and the chemical homogeneity among the regions, convincingly demonstrates that the gas in the ring is not primordial, but has been pre-enriched in a galaxy disk, then later removed and shaped by tidal forces and it is forming a sparse population of stars.

The (generalized) Casimir force of SU( N H subscript ùëÅ ùêª N_{H} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) condensation stabilizes the 5th dimension, which guarantees the quality of the PQ symmetry.

 FIRE RISK ANALYSIS BY USING SENTINEL-2 DATA: THE CASE STUDY OF THE VESUVIUS IN CAMPANIA, ITALY			None	As sadly known, forest fires are part of a set of natural disasters that have always affected regions of the world typically characterized by a tropical climate with long periods of drought. However, due to climate changes of the recent years, other regions of our planet that were not affected by this plague have also had to deal with this phenomenon. One of them is certainly the Italian peninsula, and especially the regions of southern Italy. For this reason, the scientific community, and in particular that one of the remote sensing, plays an important role in the development of reliable techniques to provide useful support to the competent authorities. Therefore, in this work, the capability of the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), derived from spaceborne remote sensing (RS) data, is assessed to monitor the forest fires occurred on a specific study area during the summer of 2017: the volcano Vesuvius, near Naples (in Campania, Italy). In particular, the index is obtained from Sentinel-2 multispectral images of the European Space Agency (ESA), which are free of charge and open accessible. Moreover, the twin Sentinel-2 (S-2) sensors allows to overcome some restrictions on time delivery and high frequency observation. These requirements are goodly matched by other spaceborne sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS satellites, but at the expense of a lower spatial resolution.	
 DeepDT: Learning Geometry From Delaunay Triangulation for Surface Reconstruction	Yiming Luo, Zhenxing Mi, Wenbing Tao	None	None	In this paper, a novel learning-based network, named DeepDT, is proposed to reconstruct the surface from Delaunay triangulation of point cloud. DeepDT learns to predict inside/outside labels of Delaunay tetrahedrons directly from a point cloud and corresponding Delaunay triangulation. The local geometry features are first extracted from the input point cloud and aggregated into a graph deriving from the Delaunay triangulation. Then a graph filtering is applied on the aggregated features in order to add structural regularization to the label prediction of tetrahedrons. Due to the complicated spatial relations between tetrahedrons and the triangles, it is impossible to directly generate ground truth labels of tetrahedrons from ground truth surface. Therefore, we propose a multi-label supervision strategy which votes for the label of a tetrahedron with labels of sampling locations inside it. The proposed DeepDT can maintain abundant geometry details without generating overly complex surfaces , especially for inner surfaces of open scenes. Meanwhile, the generalization ability and time consumption of the proposed method is acceptable and competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DeepDT.	
 On factorized overlaps: Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, twists, and Separation of Variables	Tams Gombor,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Balzs PozsgaystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We investigate the exact overlaps between eigenstates of integrable spin chains and a special class of states called ‚Äúintegrable initial/final states‚Äù. These states satisfy a special integrability constraint, and they are closely related to integrable boundary conditions. We derive new algebraic relations for the integrable states, which lead to a set of recursion relations for the exact overlaps. We solve these recursion relations and thus we derive new overlap formulas, valid in the XXX Heisenberg chain and its integrable higher spin generalizations. Afterwards we generalize the integrability condition to twisted boundary conditions, and derive the corresponding exact overlaps. Finally, we embed the integrable states into the ‚ÄúSeparation of Variables‚Äù framework, and derive an alternative representation for the exact overlaps of the XXX chain. Our derivations and proofs are rigorous, and they can form the basis of future investigations involving more complicated models such as nested or long-range deformed systems.	
 A local baseline of the black hole mass scaling relations for active galaxies. IV. Correlations between ùëÄ_BH and host galaxy ùúé, stellar mass, and luminosity.	Vardha Bennert, Tommaso Treu, Xuheng Ding, Isak Stomberg, Simon Birrer, Tomas Snyder, Matthew Malkan, Andrew Stephens, Matthew Auger	None	None	The tight correlations between the mass of supermassive black holes ( M BH subscript ùëÄ BH M_{\rm BH} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and their host-galaxy properties have been of great interest to the astrophysical community, but a clear understanding of their origin and fundamental drivers still eludes us. The local relations for active galaxies are interesting in their own right and form the foundation for any evolutionary study over cosmic time. We present Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging of a sample of 66 local active galactic nuclei (AGNs); for 14 objects, we also obtained Gemini near-infrared images. We use state of the art methods to perform surface photometry of the AGN host galaxies, decomposing them in spheroid, disk and bar (when present) and inferring the luminosity and stellar mass of the components. We combine this information with spatially-resolved kinematics obtained at the Keck Telescopes to study the correlations between M BH subscript ùëÄ BH M_{\rm BH} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (determined from single-epoch virial estimators) and host galaxy properties. The correlations are uniformly tight for our AGN sample, with intrinsic scatter 0.2 ‚àí 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.2-0.4 0.2 - 0.4 dex, smaller than or equal to that of quiescent galaxies. We find no difference between pseudo and classical bulges or barred and non-barred galaxies. We show that all the tight correlations can be simultaneously satisfied by AGN hosts in the 10 7 7 {}^{7} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT -10 9 9 {}^{9} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT regime, with data of sufficient quality.

 Regret-Optimal Filtering for Prediction and Estimation	Oron Sabag and Babak Hassibi	None	None	In this paper, we study the filtering problem of causally estimating a desired signal from a related observation signal, through the lens of regret optimization. Classical filter designs, such as ‚Ñã 2 subscript ‚Ñã 2 \mathcal{H}_{2} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (i.e., Kalman) and ‚Ñã ‚àû subscript ‚Ñã \mathcal{H}_{\infty} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àû end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , minimize the average and worst-case estimation errors, respectively. As a result ‚Ñã 2 subscript ‚Ñã 2 \mathcal{H}_{2} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT filters are sensitive to inaccuracies in the underlying statistical model, and ‚Ñã ‚àû subscript ‚Ñã \mathcal{H}_{\infty} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àû end_POSTSUBSCRIPT filters are overly conservative since they safeguard against the worst-case scenario. We propose instead to minimize the regret in order to design filters that perform well in different noise regimes by comparing their performance with that of a clairvoyant filter. More explicitly, we minimize the largest deviation of the squared estimation error of a causal filter from that of a non-causal filter that has access to future observations. In this sense, the regret-optimal filter will have the best competitive performance with respect to the non-causal benchmark filter no matter what the true signal and the observation process are. For the important case of signals that can be described with a time-invariant state-space, we provide an explicit construction for the regret optimal filter in the estimation (causal) and the prediction (strictly-causal) regimes. These solutions are obtained by reducing the regret filtering problem to a Nehari problem, i.e., approximating a non-causal operator by a causal one in spectral norm. The regret-optimal filters bear some resemblance to Kalman and ‚Ñã ‚àû subscript ‚Ñã \mathcal{H}_{\infty} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àû end_POSTSUBSCRIPT filters: they are expressed as state-space models, inherit the finite dimension of the original state-space, and their solutions require solving algebraic Riccati equations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that regret minimization inherently interpolates between the performances of the ‚Ñã 2 subscript ‚Ñã 2 \mathcal{H}_{2} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ‚Ñã ‚àû subscript ‚Ñã \mathcal{H}_{\infty} caligraphic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àû end_POSTSUBSCRIPT filters and is thus a viable approach for filter design.	
 Scaling of disorder operator at (2+1)‚Å¢ùëë U(1) quantum criticality	YanCheng Wang, Meng Cheng, Zi Yang Meng	None	None	We study disorder operator, defined as a symmetry transformation applied to a finite region, across a continuous quantum phase transition in ( 2 + 1 ) d 2 1 ùëë (2+1)d ( 2 + 1 ) italic_d . We show analytically that at a conformally-invariant critical point with U(1) symmetry, the disorder operator with a small U(1) rotation angle defined on a rectangle region exhibits power-law scaling with the perimeter of the rectangle. The exponent is proportional to the current central charge of the critical theory. Such a universal scaling behavior is due to the sharp corners of the region and we further obtain a general formula for the exponent when the corner is nearly smooth. To probe the full parameter regime, we carry out systematic computation of the U(1) disorder parameter in the square lattice Bose-Hubbard model across the superfluid-insulator transition with large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and confirm the presence of the universal corner correction. The exponent of the corner term determined from numerical simulations agrees well with the analytical predictions.

 A convolutional-neural-network estimator of CMB constraints on dark matter energy injection	WeiChih Huang, JuiLin Kuo, YueLin Sming Tsai	huang@cp3.sdu.dk	None	We show that the impact of energy injection by dark matter annihilation on the cosmic microwave background power spectra can be apprehended via a residual likelihood map. By resorting to convolutional neural networks that can fully discover the underlying pattern of the map, we propose a novel way of constraining dark matter annihilation based on the Planck 2018 data. We demonstrate that the trained neural network can efficiently predict the likelihood and accurately place bounds on the annihilation cross-section in a model-independent fashion. The machinery will be made public in the near future.

 Enhanced Normalized Conjugate Beamforming for Cell-Free Massive MIMO	GiovanniInterdonato, HienQuocNgo, andErikGLarsson	None	None	In cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) the fluctuations of the channel gain from the access points to a user are large due to the distributed topology of the system. Because of these fluctuations, data decoding schemes that treat the channel as deterministic perform inefficiently. A way to reduce the channel fluctuations is to design a precoding scheme that equalizes the effective channel gain seen by the users. Conjugate beamforming (CB) poorly contributes to harden the effective channel at the users. In this work, we propose a variant of CB dubbed enhanced normalized CB (ECB), in that the precoding vector consists of the conjugate of the channel estimate normalized by its squared norm. For this scheme, we derive an exact closed-form expression for an achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE), accounting for channel estimation errors, pilot reuse and user‚Äôs lack of channel state information (CSI), assuming independent Rayleigh fading channels. We also devise an optimal max-min fairness power allocation based only on large-scale fading quantities. ECB greatly boosts the channel hardening enabling the users to reliably decode data relying only on statistical CSI. As the provided effective channel is nearly deterministic, acquiring CSI at the users does not yield a significant gain.

 Estimates for weighted homogeneous delay systems: A Lyapunov-Krasovskii-Razumikhin approach*	GersonPortilla,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT ,Irina AlexandrovastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand SabineMondistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this paper, we present estimates for solutions and for the attraction domain of the trivial solution for systems with delayed and nonlinear weighted homogeneous right-hand side of positive degree. The results are achieved via a generalization of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional construction presented recently for homogeneous systems with standard dilation. Along with the classical approach for the calculation of the estimates within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii framework, we develop a novel approach which combines the use of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with ideas of the Razumikhin framework. More precisely, a lower bound for the functional on a special set of functions inspired by the Razumikhin condition is constructed, and an additional condition imposed on the solution of the comparison equation ensures that this bound can be used to estimate all solutions in a certain neighbourhood of the trivial one. An example shows that this approach yields less conservative estimates in comparison with the classical one.

 Modeling Assumptions Clash with the Real World: Transparency, Equity, and Community Challenges for Student Assignment Algorithms	Samantha Robertson, Tonya Nguyen, Niloufar Salehi	samanthaÀôrobertson@berkeley.edu	None	Across the United States, a growing number of school districts are turning to matching algorithms to assign students to public schools. The designers of these algorithms aimed to promote values such as transparency, equity, and community in the process. However, school districts have encountered practical challenges in their deployment. In fact, San Francisco Unified School District voted to stop using and completely redesign their student assignment algorithm because it was frustrating for families and it was not promoting educational equity in practice. We analyze this system using a Value Sensitive Design approach and find that one reason values are not met in practice is that the system relies on modeling assumptions about families‚Äô priorities, constraints, and goals that clash with the real world. These assumptions overlook the complex barriers to ideal participation that many families face, particularly because of socioeconomic inequalities. We argue that direct, ongoing engagement with stakeholders is central to aligning algorithmic values with real world conditions. In doing so we must broaden how we evaluate algorithms while recognizing the limitations of purely algorithmic solutions in addressing complex socio-political problems.	
 Meta-Learning for Effective Multi-task and Multilingual Modelling	Ishan TaruneshSushil KhyaliaVishwajeet Kumar	None	None	Natural language processing (NLP) tasks (e.g. question-answering in English) benefit from knowledge of other tasks ( e.g. , named entity recognition in English) and knowledge of other languages ( e.g. , question-answering in Spanish). Such shared representations are typically learned in isolation, either across tasks or across languages. In this work, we propose a meta-learning approach to learn the interactions between both tasks and languages. We also investigate the role of different sampling strategies used during meta-learning. We present experiments on five different tasks and six different languages from the XTREME multilingual benchmark dataset Hu et al. ( 2020 ) . Our meta-learned model clearly improves in performance compared to competitive baseline models that also include multi-task baselines. We also present zero-shot evaluations on unseen target languages to demonstrate the utility of our proposed model.

 Hunting for Dark Matter and New Physics with (a) GECCO	Adam Coogan, Alexander Moiseev, Logan Morrison, and, StefanoProfumo	None	None	We outline the science opportunities in the areas of searches for dark matter and new physics offered by a proposed future MeV gamma-ray telescope, the Galactic Explorer with a Coded Aperture Mask Compton Telescope (GECCO). We point out that such an instrument would play a critical role in opening up a discovery window for particle dark matter with mass in the MeV or sub-MeV range, in disentangling the origin of the mysterious 511 keV line emission in the Galactic Center region, and in potentially discovering Hawking evaporation from light primordial black holes.	
 The GRIFFIN Perception Dataset: Bridging the Gap Between Flapping-Wing Flight and Robotic Perception	JP RodrguezGmez, Tapia, Paneque, Grau, Gmez Eguluz,JR Martnezde Dios and Ollero	None	None	The development of automatic perception systems and techniques for bio-inspired flapping-wing robots is severely hampered by the high technical complexity of these platforms and the installation of onboard sensors and electronics. Besides, flapping-wing robot perception suffers from high vibration levels and abrupt movements during flight, which cause motion blur and strong changes in lighting conditions. This paper presents a perception dataset for bird-scale flapping-wing robots as a tool to help alleviate the aforementioned problems. The presented data include measurements from onboard sensors widely used in aerial robotics and suitable to deal with the perception challenges of flapping-wing robots, such as an event camera, a conventional camera, and two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), as well as ground truth measurements from a laser tracker or a motion capture system. A total of 21 datasets of different types of flights were collected in three different scenarios (one indoor and two outdoor). To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge this is the first dataset for flapping-wing robot perception.

For a sample of five nearby grand design spirals located on the Main Sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies, we exploit maps at 500 pc resolution of stellar mass and star formation rate ( M ‚ãÜ subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ M_{\star} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and SFR). For the same cells, we also have estimates of the neutral ( M HI subscript ùëÄ HI M_{\rm HI} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_HI end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and molecular ( M H 2 subscript ùëÄ subscript H 2 M_{\rm H_{2}} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) gas masses. To compute the redshift evolution we exploit two relations: i) one between the molecular-to-neutral mass ratio and the total gas mass ( M gas subscript ùëÄ gas M_{\rm gas} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_gas end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), whose scatter shows a strong dependence with the distance from the spatially resolved MS, and ii) the one between log ‚Å° ( M H 2 / M ‚ãÜ ) subscript ùëÄ subscript H 2 subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ \log(M_{\rm{H_{2}}}/M_{\star}) roman_log ( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and log ‚Å° ( M HI / M ‚ãÜ ) subscript ùëÄ HI subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ \log(M_{\rm{HI}}/M_{\star}) roman_log ( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_HI end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) . For both methods, we find that M H 2 subscript ùëÄ subscript H 2 M_{\rm H_{2}} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / M HI subscript ùëÄ HI M_{\rm HI} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_HI end_POSTSUBSCRIPT within the optical radius slightly decreases with redshift, contrary to common expectations of galaxies becoming progressively more dominated by molecular hydrogen at high redshifts. We discuss possible implications of this trend on our understanding of the internal working of high redshift galaxies.

 An Updated Formalism For Line-Driven Radiative Acceleration and Implications for Stellar Mass Loss	Aylecia Lattimer, Steven Cranmer	None	None	Radiation contributes to the acceleration of large-scale flows in various astrophysical environments because of the strong opacity in spectral lines. Quantification of the associated force is crucial to understanding these line-driven flows, and a large number of lines (due to the full set of elements and ionization stages) must be taken into account. Here we provide new calculations of the dimensionless line strengths and associated opacity-dependent force multipliers for an updated list of approximately 4.5 million spectral lines compiled from the NIST, CHIANTI, CMFGEN, and TOPbase databases. To maintain generality of application to different environments, we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, illumination by a Planck function, and the Sobolev approximation. We compute the line forces in a two-dimensional grid of temperatures (i.e., values between 5,200 and 70,000 K) and densities (varying over 11 orders of magnitude). Historically, the force multiplier function has been described by a power-law function of optical depth. We revisit this assumption by fitting alternative functions that include a saturation to a constant value (Gayley‚Äôs Q ¬Ø ¬Ø ùëÑ \bar{Q} over¬Ø start_ARG italic_Q end_ARG parameter) in the optically-thin limit. This alternate form is a better fit than the power-law form, and we use it to calculate example mass-loss rates for massive main-sequence stars. Because the power-law force multiplier does not continue to arbitrarily small optical depths, we find a sharp decrease, or quenching, of line-driven winds for stars with effective temperatures less than about 15,000 K.

 Learning to falsify automated driving vehicles with prior knowledge	Andrea Favrin, Vladislav Nenchev, Angelo Cenedese	None	BMW Group, 85716 Unterschleissheim, Germany (e-mail: {andrea.favrin,vladislav.nenchev}@bmw.de)	While automated driving technology has achieved a tremendous progress, the scalable and rigorous testing and verification of safe automated and autonomous driving vehicles remain challenging. This paper proposes a learning-based falsification framework for testing the implementation of an automated or self-driving function in simulation. We assume that the function specification is associated with a violation metric on possible scenarios. Prior knowledge is incorporated to limit the scenario parameter variance and in a model-based falsifier to guide and improve the learning process. For an exemplary adaptive cruise controller, the presented framework yields non-trivial falsifying scenarios with higher reward, compared to scenarios obtained by purely learning-based or purely model-based falsification approaches.	
 In Situ Generation of High-Energy Spin-Polarized Electrons in a Beam-Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator	Zan Nie, Fei Li, Felipe Morales, Serguei Patchkovskii, Olga Smirnova, Weiming An, Noa Nambu, Daniel Matteo, Kenneth Marsh, Frank Tsung, Warren Mori, Chan Joshi	znie@ucla.edu	None	In situ generation of a high-energy, high-current, spin-polarized electron beam is an outstanding scientific challenge to the development of plasma-based accelerators for high-energy colliders. In this Letter we show how such a spin-polarized relativistic beam can be produced by ionization injection of electrons of certain atoms with a circularly polarized laser field into a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator, providing a much desired one-step solution to this challenge. Using time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE) simulations, we show the propensity rule of spin-dependent ionization of xenon atoms does not flip as a function of photoelectron energy compared with the non-adiabatic tunneling regime, leading to high total spin polarization. Furthermore, three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are incorporated with TDSE simulations, providing start-to-end simulations of spin-dependent strong-field ionization of xenon atoms and subsequent trapping, acceleration, and preservation of electron spin-polarization in lithium plasma. We show the generation of a high-current (0.8 kA), ultra-low-normalized-emittance ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 37 nm), and high-energy (2.7 GeV) electron beam within just 11 cm distance, with up to ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 31% net spin polarization. Higher current, energy, and net spin-polarization beams are possible by optimizing this concept, thus solving a long-standing problem facing the development of plasma accelerators.	
 2-generated axial algebras of Monster type (2‚Å¢ùõΩ,ùõΩ)	Clara Franchi, Mario Mainardis, Sergey Shpectorov	None	None	In this paper we prove that 2 2 2 2 -generated primitive axial algebras of Monster type ( 2 Œ≤ , Œ≤ ) 2 ùõΩ ùõΩ (2\beta,\beta) ( 2 italic_Œ≤ , italic_Œ≤ ) over a ring R ùëÖ R italic_R in which 2 2 2 2 and Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ are invertible can be generated as R ùëÖ R italic_R -module by 8 8 8 8 vectors.

 Evidence for Radial Expansion at the Core of the Orion Complex with Gaia EDR3	Cameren Swiggum, Elena DOnghia, Joo Alves, Josefa Groschedl, Michael Foley, Catherine Zucker, Stefan Meingast, Boquan Chen, Alyssa Goodman	None	None	We present a phase-space study of two stellar groups located at the core of the Orion complex: Brice√±o-1 and Orion Belt Population-near (OBP-near). We identify the groups with the unsupervised clustering algorithm, Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN), which previously identified twelve new stellar substructures in the Orion complex. For each of the two groups, we derive the 3D space motions of individual stars using Gaia EDR3 proper motions supplemented by radial velocities from Gaia DR2, APOGEE-2, and GALAH DR3. We present evidence for radial expansion of the two groups from a common center. Unlike previous work, our study suggests that evidence of stellar group expansion is confined only to OBP-near and Brice√±o-1, whereas the rest of the groups in the complex show more complicated motions. Interestingly, the stars in the two groups lie at the center of a dust shell, as revealed via an extant 3D dust map. The exact mechanism that produces such coherent motions remains unclear, while the observed radial expansion and dust shell suggest that massive stellar feedback could have influenced the star formation history of these groups.	
 Contrasting Mechanisms for Photodissociation of Methyl Halides Adsorbed on Thin Films of C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÜ and C‚ÇÜF‚ÇÜ	ET Jensen	ejensen@unbc.ca	None	The mechanisms for photodissociation of methyl halides (CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT X, X= Cl, Br, I) have been studied for these molecules when adsorbed on thin films of C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT H 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT or C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT F 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT on copper single crystals, using time-of-flight spectroscopy with 248nm and 193nm light. For CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Cl and CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Br monolayers adsorbed on C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT H 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , two photodissociation pathways can be identified‚Äì neutral photodissociation similar to the gas-phase, and a dissociative electron attachment (DEA) pathway due to photoelectrons from the metal. The same methyl halides adsorbed on a C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT F 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT thin film display only neutral photodissociation, with the DEA pathway entirely absent due to intermolecular quenching via a LUMO-derived electronic band in the C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT F 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT thin film. For CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT I adsorbed on a C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT F 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT thin film, illumination with 248nm light results in CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT photofragments departing due to neutral photodissociation via the A-band absorption. When CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT I monolayers on C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT H 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT thin films are illuminated at the same wavelength, additional new photodissociation pathways are observed that are due to absorption in the molecular film with energy transfer leading to dissociation of the CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT I molecules adsorbed on top. The proposed mechanism for this photodissociation is via a charge-transfer complex for the C 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT H 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT layer and adsorbed CH 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT I.	
 Curriculum Learning: A SurveyThis work was supported by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2019-0235, within PNCDI III. This article has also benefited from the support of the Romanian Young Academy, which is funded by Stiftung Mercator and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for the period 2020-2022. This work was also supported by European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant number 951911 - AI4Media.	Petru Soviany, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Paolo Rota, Nicu Sebe	None	None	Training machine learning models in a meaningful order, from the easy samples to the hard ones, using curriculum learning can provide performance improvements over the standard training approach based on random data shuffling, without any additional computational costs. Curriculum learning strategies have been successfully employed in all areas of machine learning, in a wide range of tasks. However, the necessity of finding a way to rank the samples from easy to hard, as well as the right pacing function for introducing more difficult data can limit the usage of the curriculum approaches. In this survey, we show how these limits have been tackled in the literature, and we present different curriculum learning instantiations for various tasks in machine learning. We construct a multi-perspective taxonomy of curriculum learning approaches by hand, considering various classification criteria. We further build a hierarchical tree of curriculum learning methods using an agglomerative clustering algorithm, linking the discovered clusters with our taxonomy. At the end, we provide some interesting directions for future work.	
 A nowcasting approach to generate timely estimates of Mexican economic activity: An application to the period of COVID-19	Francisco Corona, Graciela GonzlezFaras, Jess LpezPrez	None	None	In this paper, we present a new approach based on dynamic factor models (DFMs) to perform nowcasts for the percentage annual variation of the Mexican Global Economic Activity Indicator (IGAE in Spanish). The procedure consists of the following steps: i) build a timely and correlated database by using economic and financial time series and real-time variables such as social mobility and significant topics extracted by Google Trends; ii) estimate the common factors using the two-step methodology of Doz et al., ( 2011 ) ; iii) use the common factors in univariate time-series models for test data; and iv) according to the best results obtained in the previous step, combine the statistically equal better nowcasts (Diebold-Mariano test) to generate the current nowcasts. We obtain timely and accurate nowcasts for the IGAE, including those for the current phase of drastic drops in the economy related to COVID-19 sanitary measures. Additionally, the approach allows us to disentangle the key variables in the DFM by estimating the confidence interval for both the factor loadings and the factor estimates. This approach can be used in official statistics to obtain preliminary estimates for IGAE up to 50 days before the official results.

On the other hand, in the field of robotics, large-scale learning has always been difficult. Supervision is hard to gather and real world physical interactions are expensive.

 ProbLock: Probability-based Logic Locking	MichaelYueDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSanta Clara UniversitySanta Clara, California, USAFatemehTehranipoorDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSanta Clara UniversitySanta Clara, California, USA	None	None	Integrated circuit (IC) piracy and overproduction are serious issues that threaten the security and integrity of a system. Logic locking is a type of hardware obfuscation technique where additional key gates are inserted into the circuit. Only the correct key can unlock the functionality of that circuit otherwise the system produces the wrong output. In an effort to hinder these threats on ICs, we have developed a probability-based logic locking technique to protect the design of a circuit. Our proposed technique called ‚ÄúProbLock‚Äù can be applied to combinational and sequential circuits through a critical selection process. We used a filtering process to select the best location of key gates based on various constraints. Each step in the filtering process generates a subset of nodes for each constraint. We also analyzed the correlation between each constraint and adjusted the strength of the constraints before inserting key gates. We have tested our algorithm on 40 benchmarks from the ISCAS ‚Äô85 and ISCAS ‚Äô89 suite.	
 Globally optimal stretching foliations of dynamical systems reveal the organizing skeleton of intensive instabilities	Sanjeeva Balasuriya, Erik MBollt	None	None	Understanding instabilities in dynamical systems drives to the heart of modern chaos theory, whether forecasting or attempting to control future outcomes. Instabilities in the sense of locally maximal stretching in maps is well understood, and is connected to the concepts of Lyapunov exponents/vectors, Oseledec spaces and the Cauchy‚ÄìGreen tensor. In this paper, we extend the concept to global optimization of stretching, as this forms a skeleton organizing the general instabilities. The ‚Äòmap‚Äô is general but incorporates the inevitability of finite-time as in any realistic application: it can be defined via a finite sequence of discrete maps, or a finite-time flow associated with a continuous dynamical system. Limiting attention to two-dimensions, we formulate the global optimization problem as one over a restricted class of foliations, and establish the foliations which both maximize and minimize global stretching. A classification of nondegenerate singularities of the foliations is obtained. Numerical issues in computing optimal foliations are examined, in particular insights into special curves along which foliations appear to veer and/or do not cross, and foliation behavior near singularities. Illustrations and validations of the results to the H√©non map, the double-gyre flow and the standard map are provided.

Martins-Ferreira, A. Montoli, and M. Sobral. Instead of points (=split epimorphisms) it uses generalized points, which we define as composable pairs of morphisms whose composites are pullback stable regular epimorphisms. This approach is convenient in describing the connection between split and regular Schreier epimorphisms of monoids.	
 Introducing a Central African Primate Vocalisation Dataset for Automated Species Classification			None	Automated classification of animal vocalisations is a potentially powerful wildlife monitoring tool. Training robust classifiers requires sizable annotated datasets, which are not easily recorded in the wild. To circumvent this problem, we recorded four primate species under semi-natural conditions in a wildlife sanctuary in Cameroon with the objective to train a classifier capable of detecting species in the wild. Here, we introduce the collected dataset, describe our approach and initial results of classifier development. To increase the efficiency of the annotation process, we condensed the recordings with an energy/change based automatic vocalisation detection. Segmenting the annotated chunks into training, validation and test sets, initial results reveal up to 82% unweighted average recall (UAR) test set performance in four-class primate species classification.	
 Anytime 3D Object Reconstruction using Multi-modal Variational Autoencoder	Hyeonwoo Yu and Jean Oh	None	None	For effective human-robot teaming, it is important for the robots to be able to share their visual perception with the human operators. In a harsh remote collaboration setting, data compression techniques such as autoencoder can be utilized to obtain and transmit the data in terms of latent variables in a compact form. In addition, to ensure real-time runtime performance even under unstable environments, an anytime estimation approach is desired that can reconstruct the full contents from incomplete information. In this context, we propose a method for imputation of latent variables whose elements are partially lost. To achieve the anytime property with only a few dimensions of variables, exploiting prior information of the category-level is essential. A prior distribution used in variational autoencoders is simply assumed to be isotropic Gaussian regardless of the labels of each training datapoint. This type of flattened prior makes it difficult to perform imputation from the category-level distributions. We overcome this limitation by exploiting a category-specific multi-modal prior distribution in the latent space. The missing elements of the partially transferred data can be sampled, by finding a specific modal according to the remaining elements. Since the method is designed to use partial elements for anytime estimation, it can also be applied for data over-compression. Based on the experiments on the ModelNet and Pascal3D datasets, the proposed approach shows consistently superior performance over autoencoder and variational autoencoder up to 70% data loss.	
 KP Solitons from Tropical Limits	Daniele Agostini, Claudia Fevola, Yelena Mandelshtam and Bernd Sturmfels	None	None	We study solutions to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation whose underlying algebraic curves undergo tropical degenerations. Riemann‚Äôs theta function becomes a finite exponential sum that is supported on a Delaunay polytope. We introduce the Hirota variety which parametrizes all tau functions arising from such a sum. We compute tau functions from points on the Sato Grassmannian that represent Riemann-Roch spaces and we present an algorithm that finds a soliton solution from a rational nodal curve.	
 Bioverse: a simulation framework to assess the statistical power of future biosignature surveys	Alex Bixel, Dniel Apai	None	None	Next-generation space observatories will conduct the first systematic surveys of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres and search for evidence of life beyond Earth. While in-depth observations of the nearest habitable worlds may yield enticing results, there are fundamental questions about planetary habitability and evolution which can only be answered through population-level studies of dozens to hundreds of terrestrial planets. To determine the requirements for next-generation observatories to address these questions, we have developed Bioverse . Bioverse combines existing knowledge of exoplanet statistics with a survey simulation and hypothesis testing framework to determine whether proposed space-based direct imaging and transit spectroscopy surveys will be capable of detecting various hypothetical statistical relationships between the properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Following a description of the code, we apply Bioverse to determine whether an ambitious direct imaging or transit survey would be able to determine the extent of the circumstellar habitable zone and study the evolution of Earth-like planets. Given recent evidence that Earth-sized habitable zone planets are likely much rarer than previously believed (Pascucci et al., 2019 ) , we find that space missions with large search volumes will be necessary to study the population of terrestrial and habitable worlds. Moving forward, Bioverse provides a methodology for performing trade studies of future observatory concepts to maximize their ability to address population-level questions, including and beyond the specific examples explored here.

 Representations of closed quadratic forms associated with Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes holomorphic families of linear relations	YuMArlinski, Hassi	yury.arlinskii@gmail.com	Stuttgart, Germany	In this paper holomorphic families of linear relations which belong to the Stieltjes or inverse Stieltjes class are studied. It is shown that in their domain of holomorphy ‚ÑÇ ‚àñ ‚Ñù + ‚ÑÇ subscript ‚Ñù {\mathbb{C}}\setminus{\mathbb{R}}_{+} blackboard_C ‚àñ blackboard_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT + end_POSTSUBSCRIPT the values of Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes families are, up to a rotation, maximal sectorial. This leads to a study of the associated closed sesquilinear forms and their representations. In particular, it is shown that the Stieltjes and inverse Stieltjes holomorphic families of linear relations are of type (B) in the sense of Kato. These results are proved by using linear fractional transforms which connect these families to holomorphic functions that belong to a combined Nevanlinna-Schur class and a key tool then relies on a specific structure of contractive operators.	
 Quality Assessment of Super-Resolved Omnidirectional Image Quality Using Tangential Views	Cagri OzcinarstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Aakanksha RanastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSamsung RDstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, UK, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, USA	None	None	Omnidirectional images (ODIs), also known as 360-degree images, enable viewers to explore all directions of a given 360-degree scene from a fixed point. Designing an immersive imaging system with ODI is challenging as such systems require very large resolution coverage of the entire 360 viewing space to provide an enhanced quality of experience (QoE). Despite remarkable progress on single image super-resolution (SISR) methods with deep-learning techniques, no study for quality assessments of super-resolved ODIs exists to analyze the quality of such SISR techniques. This paper proposes an objective, full-reference quality assessment framework which studies quality measurement for ODIs generated by GAN-based and CNN-based SISR methods. The quality assessment framework offers to utilize tangential views to cope with the spherical nature of a given ODIs. The generated tangential views are distortion-free and can be efficiently scaled to high-resolution spherical data for SISR quality measurement. We extensively evaluate two state-of-the-art SISR methods using widely used full-reference SISR quality metrics adapted to our designed framework. In addition, our study reveals that most objective metric show high performance over CNN based SISR, while subjective tests favors GAN-based architectures.	
 Relative vanishing theorems for Q-schemes	Takumi Murayama	takumim@math.princeton.edu	"Department of MathematicsPrinceton UniversityPrinceton, NJ

Our proof uses Grothendieck‚Äôs limit theorem for sheaf cohomology and Zariski‚ÄìRiemann spaces. As an application, we extend Boutot‚Äôs theorem to the case of locally quasi-excellent ùêê ùêê \mathbf{Q} bold_Q -algebras by showing that if R ‚Üí R ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí ùëÖ superscript ùëÖ ‚Ä≤ R\to R^{\prime} italic_R ‚Üí italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is a cyclically pure homomorphism of locally quasi-excellent ùêê ùêê \mathbf{Q} bold_Q -algebras, and R ‚Ä≤ superscript ùëÖ ‚Ä≤ R^{\prime} italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT has rational singularities, then R ùëÖ R italic_R has rational singularities. This solves a conjecture of Boutot and answers a question of Schoutens in the locally quasi-excellent case.	
 Robust Gas Pipeline Network Expansion Planning to Support Power System Reliability	Kaarthik SundarstarstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Sidhant MisradaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Anatoly ZlotnikdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Russell BentdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We examine the problem of optimal transport capacity expansion planning for a gas pipeline network to service the growing demand of gas-fired power plants that are increasingly used to provide base load, flexibility, and reserve generation for bulk electric system. The aim is to determine the minimal cost set of additional pipes and gas compressors that can be added to the network to provide the additional capacity to service future loads. This combinatorial optimization problem is initially formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which we then extend to account for the variability that is inherent to the demands of gas-fired electricity production and uncertainty in expected future loads. We consider here steady-state flow modeling while ensuring that the solution is feasible for all possible values of interval uncertainty in loads, which results in a challenging semi-infinite problem. We apply previously derived monotonicity properties that enable simplification of the problem to require constraint satisfaction in the two extremal scenarios only, and then formulate the robust gas pipeline network expansion planning problem using a mixed-integer second order cone formulation. We consider case studies on the Belgian network test case to examine the performance of the proposed approach.	
 Anchor Distance for 3D Multi-Object Distance Estimation from 2D Single Shot	Hyeonwoo Yu and Jean Oh	None	None	Visual perception of the objects in a 3D environment is a key to successful performance in autonomous driving and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In this paper, we present a real time approach for estimating the distances to multiple objects in a scene using only a single-shot image. Given a 2D Bounding Box (BBox) and object parameters, a 3D distance to the object can be calculated directly using 3D reprojection; however, such methods are prone to significant errors because an error from the 2D detection can be amplified in 3D. In addition, it is also challenging to apply such methods to a real-time system due to the computational burden. In the case of the traditional multi-object detection methods, existing works have been developed for specific tasks such as object segmentation or 2D BBox regression. These methods introduce the concept of anchor BBox for elaborate 2D BBox estimation, and predictors are specialized and trained for specific 2D BBoxes. In order to estimate the distances to the 3D objects from a single 2D image, we introduce the notion of anchor distance based on an object‚Äôs location and propose a method that applies the anchor distance to the multi-object detector structure. We let the predictors catch the distance prior using anchor distance and train the network based on the distance. The predictors can be characterized to the objects located in a specific distance range. By propagating the distance prior using a distance anchor to the predictors, it is feasible to perform the precise distance estimation and real-time execution simultaneously. The proposed method achieves about 30 FPS speed, and shows the lowest RMSE compared to the existing methods.

 A metric for evaluating 3D reconstruction and mapping performance with no ground truthing			None	It is not easy when evaluating 3D mapping performance because existing metrics require ground truth data that can only be collected with special instruments. In this paper, we propose a metric, dense map posterior (DMP), for this evaluation. It can work without any ground truth data. Instead, it calculates a comparable value, reflecting a map posterior probability, from dense point cloud observations. In our experiments, the proposed DMP is benchmarked against ground truth-based metrics. Results show that DMP can provide a similar evaluation capability. The proposed metric makes evaluating different methods more flexible and opens many new possibilities, such as self-supervised methods and more available datasets.	
 Large-stepsize integrators for charged-particle dynamics over multiple time scales	Ernst HairerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Christian LubichstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, YanyanShistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The Boris algorithm, a closely related variational integrator and a newly proposed filtered variational integrator are studied when they are used to numerically integrate the equations of motion of a charged particle in a non-uniform strong magnetic field, taking step sizes that are much larger than the period of the Larmor rotations. For the Boris algorithm and the standard (unfiltered) variational integrator, satisfactory behaviour is only obtained when the component of the initial velocity orthogonal to the magnetic field is filtered out. The particle motion shows varying behaviour over multiple time scales: fast Larmor rotation, guiding centre motion, slow perpendicular drift, near-conservation of the magnetic moment over very long times and conservation of energy for all times. Using modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and numerical solutions, it is analysed to which extent this behaviour is reproduced by the three numerical integrators used with large step sizes.	
 Learning-‚ÄòN-Flying: A Learning-based, Decentralized Mission Aware UAS Collision Avoidance Scheme	Alna Rodionova, Yash Vardhan Pant, Connor Kurtz, Kuk Jang, Houssam Abbas, Rahul Mangharam	alena.rodionova@seas.upenn.edu	None	Urban Air Mobility, the scenario where hundreds of manned and UAS ( UAS ) carry out a wide variety of missions (e.g. moving humans and goods within the city), is gaining acceptance as a transportation solution of the future. One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-‚ÄòN-Flying (LNF) a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on-the-fly and allows autonomous UAS managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UAS as a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining: a) learning-based decision-making, and b) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UAS on a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds), and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less than 1 % percent 1 1\% 1 % in the worst-case, improving to near 0 % percent 0 0\% 0 % in more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide variety of settings through multiple case studies.	
 Determining rigid body motion from accelerometer data through the square-root of a negative semi-definite tensor, with applications in mild traumatic brain injury	Yang Wan, Alice Lux Fawzi, Haneesh Kesari	None	None	Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI) are caused by violent head motions or impacts. Most mTBI prevention strategies explicitly or implicitly rely on a ‚Äúbrain injury criterion‚Äù. A brain injury criterion takes some descriptor of the head‚Äôs motion as input and yields a prediction for that motion‚Äôs potential for causing mTBI as the output. The inputs are descriptors of the head‚Äôs motion that are usually synthesized from accelerometer and gyroscope data. In the context of brain injury criterion the head is modeled as a rigid body. We present an algorithm for determining the complete motion of the head using data from only four head mounted tri-axial accelerometers. In contrast to inertial measurement unit based algorithms for determining rigid body motion the presented algorithm does not depend on data from gyroscopes; which consume much more power than accelerometers. Several algorithms that also make use of data from only accelerometers already exist. However, those algorithms, except for the recently presented AO-algorithm [Rahaman MM, Fang W, Fawzi AL, Wan Y, Kesari H (2020): J Mech Phys Solids 104014], give the rigid body‚Äôs acceleration field in terms of the body frame, which in general is unknown. Compared to the AO-algorithm the presented algorithm is much more insensitive to bias type errors, such as those that arise from inaccurate measurement of sensor positions and orientations.

 Computing Robust Forward Invariant Sets of Multidimensional Non-linear Systems via Geometric Deformation of Polytopes	Taha Ameen, Shayok Mukhopadhyay, and Nasser Qaddoumi	None	None	This paper develops and implements an algorithm to compute sequences of polytopic Robust Forward Invariant Sets (RFIS) that can parametrically vary in size between the maximal and minimal RFIS of a nonlinear dynamical system. This is done through a novel computational approach that geometrically deforms a polytope into an invariant set using a sequence of homeomorphishms, based on an invariance condition that only needs to be satisfied at a finite set of test points. For achieving this, a fast computational test is developed to establish if a given polytopic set is an RFIS. The geometric nature of the proposed approach makes it applicable for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous nonlinear systems in the presence of bounded additive disturbances. The versatility of the proposed approach is presented through simulation results on a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems in two and three dimensions, for which, sequences of invariant sets are computed.

 On the Higher Loop Euler-Heisenberg Trans-Series Structure	Gerald Dunne and Zachary HarrisDepartment of Physics, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT , USA	None	None	We show that the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg QED effective Lagrangian in a constant background field acquires a very different non-perturbative trans-series structure at two-loop and higher-loop order in the fine structure constant. Beyond one-loop, virtual particles interact, causing fluctuations about the instantons, whereby the simple poles of the one-loop Borel transform become branch points. We illustrate this in detail at two-loop order using Ritus‚Äôs seminal result for the renormalized two-loop effective Lagrangian as an exact double-integral representation, and propose a possible new approach to computations at higher loop order. Our methods yield remarkably accurate extrapolations from weak-field to strong-field, and from magnetic to electric background field, at both one-loop and two-loop order, based on surprisingly little perturbative input.

 HIV viral load and the efficacy of antiviral drug	Stephanie Yunfei Zhang and Mesfin Asfaw Taye	None	None	Developing antiviral drugs is an exigent task since viruses mutate to overcome the effect of antiviral drugs. As a result, the efficacy of most antiviral drugs is short-lived. To include this effect, we modify the Neumann and Dahari model. Considering the fact that the efficacy of the antiviral drug varies in time, the differential equations introduced in the previous model systems are rewritten to study the correlation between the viral load and antiviral drug. The effect of antiviral drug that either prevents infection or stops the production of a virus is explored. First, the efficacy of the drug is considered to decreases monotonously as time progresses. In this case, our result depicts that when the efficacy of the drug is low, the viral load decreases and increases back in time revealing the effect of the antiviral drugs is short-lived. On the other hand, for the antiviral drug with high efficacy, the viral load, as well as the number of infected cells, monotonously decreases while the number of uninfected cells increases. The dependence of the critical drug efficacy on time is also explored. Moreover, the correlation between viral load, the antiviral drug, and CTL response is also explored. In this case, not only the dependence for the basic reproduction ratio on the model parameters is explored but also we analyze the critical drug efficacy as a function of time. We show that the term related to the basic reproduction ratio increases when the CTL response step up. A simple analytically solvable mathematical model is also presented to analyze the correlation between viral load and antiviral drugs.

 Cloud, Fog or Edge: Where to Compute?	Dragi Kimovski, Roland Math, Josef Hammer, Narges Mehran, Hermann Hellwagner and Radu Prodan	None	None	The computing continuum extends the high-performance cloud data centers with energy-efficient and low-latency devices close to the data sources located at the edge of the network. However, the heterogeneity of the computing continuum raises multiple challenges related to application management. These include where to offload an application ‚Äì from the cloud to the edge ‚Äì to meet its computation and communication requirements. To support these decisions, we provide in this article a detailed performance and carbon footprint analysis of a selection of use case applications with complementary resource requirements across the computing continuum over a real-life evaluation testbed.	
 Fibonacci turbulence	Natalia Vladimirova,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Michal ShavitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Gregory FalkovichstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Never is the difference between thermal equilibrium and turbulence so dramatic, as when a quadratic invariant makes the equilibrium statistics exactly Gaussian with independently fluctuating modes. That happens in two very different yet deeply connected classes of systems: incompressible hydrodynamics and resonantly interacting waves. This work presents the first detailed information-theoretic analysis of turbulence in such strongly interacting systems. The analysis involves both energy and entropy and elucidates the fundamental roles of space and time in setting the cascade direction and the changes of the statistics along it. We introduce a beautifully simple yet rich family of discrete models with triplet interactions of neighboring modes and show that it has quadratic conservation laws defined by the Fibonacci numbers. Depending on how the interaction time changes with the mode number, three types of turbulence were found: single direct cascade, double cascade, and the first ever case of a single inverse cascade. We describe quantitatively how deviation from thermal equilibrium all the way to turbulent cascades makes statistics increasingly non-Gaussian and find the self-similar form of the one-mode probability distribution. We reveal where the information (entropy deficit) is encoded and disentangle the communication channels between modes, as quantified by the mutual information in pairs and the interaction information inside triplets.	
 Well-Posedness for the Reaction-Diffusion Equation with Temperature in a critical Besov Space	Chun Liu, JanEric Sulzbach	None	None	We derive a model for the non-isothermal reaction-diffusion equation. Combining ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics with the energetic variational approach we obtain a general system modeling the evolution of a non-isothermal chemical reaction with general mass kinetics. From this we recover a linearized model for a system close to equilibrium and we analyze the global-in-time well-posedness of the system for small initial data for a critical Besov space.	
 Spectrum Attention Mechanism for Time Series Classification	Shibo Zhouzhou, Yu Panpan	None	None	Time series classification(TSC) has always been an important and challenging research task. With the wide application of deep learning, more and more researchers use deep learning models to solve TSC problems. Since time series always contains a lot of noise, which has a negative impact on network training, people usually filter the original data before training the network. The existing schemes are to treat the filtering and training as two stages, and the design of the filter requires expert experience, which increases the design difficulty of the algorithm and is not universal. We note that the essence of filtering is to filter out the insignificant frequency components and highlight the important ones, which is similar to the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose an attention mechanism that acts on spectrum (SAM). The network can assign appropriate weights to each frequency component to achieve adaptive filtering. We use L1 regularization to further enhance the frequency screening capability of SAM. We also propose a segmented-SAM (SSAM) to avoid the loss of time domain information caused by using the spectrum of the whole sequence. In which, a tumbling window is introduced to segment the original data. Then SAM is applied to each segment to generate new features. We propose a heuristic strategy to search for the appropriate number of segments. Experimental results show that SSAM can produce better feature representations, make the network converge faster, and improve the robustness and classification accuracy.

One of the key challenges of continual learning is to avoid catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., forgetting old tasks in the presence of more recent tasks. Over the past few years, a large range of methods and tricks have been introduced to address the continual learning problem, but many have not been fairly and systematically compared under a variety of realistic and practical settings.	
 Resource Allocation for Vehicle Platooning in 5G NR-V2X via Deep Reinforcement Learning	Liu CaostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hao YinstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Vehicle platooning, one of the advanced services supported by 5G New Radio V2X (NR-V2X), improves traffic efficiency in the connected intelligent transportation systems (C-ITSs). However, the packet collision probability of platoon communication, especially in the out-of-coverage area, is significantly impacted by the random selection algorithm employed in the current resource allocation scheme. In this paper, we first analyze the collision probability via the random selection algorithm based on the current standard. Subsequently, we investigate the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that decreases the collision probability by letting the agent (platoon leader) learn from the communication environment. Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to verify the results obtained in the analytical model and to compare the results between the two discussed algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed DRL algorithm outperforms the random selection algorithm in terms of different vehicle density, which at least lowering the collision probability by 73% and 45% in low and high vehicle density respectively.	
 A unifying framework for the ùúà-Tamari lattice and principal order ideals in Young‚Äôs lattice	Matias von Bell, Rafael Gonzlez DLen, Francisco Mayorga Cetina, Martha Yip	matias.vonbell@uky.edu	Department of MathematicsUniversity of Kentucky	We present a unifying framework in which both the ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ -Tamari lattice, introduced by Pr√©ville-Ratelle and Viennot, and principal order ideals in Young‚Äôs lattice indexed by lattice paths ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ , are realized as the dual graphs of two combinatorially striking triangulations of a family of flow polytopes which we call the ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ -caracol flow polytopes.

 Finding hidden-feature depending laws inside a data set and classifying it using Neural Network.	Thilo Moshagen, Nihal Acharya Adde, Ajay Navilarekal Rajgopal	None	None	The logcosh loss function for neural networks has been developed to combine the advantage of the absolute error loss function of not overweighting outliers with the advantage of the mean square error of continuous derivative near the mean, which makes the last phase of learning easier. It is clear, and one experiences it soon, that in the case of clustered data, an artificial neural network with logcosh loss learns the bigger cluster rather than the mean of the two. Even more so, the ANN, when used for regression of a set-valued function, will learn a value close to one of the choices, in other words, one branch of the set-valued function, while a mean-square-error NN will learn the value in between. This work suggests a method that uses artificial neural networks with logcosh loss to find the branches of set-valued mappings in parameter-outcome sample sets and classifies the samples according to those branches.

 Test and Evaluation Framework for Multi-Agent Systems of Autonomous Intelligent Agents This paper includes funded research conducted through the System Engineering Research Center.	Erin Lanus,Ivan Hernandez,Adam Dachowicz,Laura Freeman,Melanie Grande,Andrew Lang,Jitesh Panchal,Anthony Patrick,Scott Welch	None	None	Test and evaluation is a necessary process for ensuring that engineered systems perform as intended under a variety of conditions, both expected and unexpected. In this work, we consider the unique challenges of developing a unifying test and evaluation framework for complex ensembles of cyber-physical systems with embedded artificial intelligence. We propose a framework that incorporates test and evaluation throughout not only the development life cycle, but continues into operation as the system learns and adapts in a noisy, changing, and contended environment. The framework accounts for the challenges of testing the integration of diverse systems at various hierarchical scales of composition while respecting that testing time and resources are limited. A generic use case is provided for illustrative purposes and research directions emerging as a result of exploring the use case via the framework are suggested.	
 Optimal Disclosure of Information to Privately Informed Agents	Ozan Candogan, Philipp Strack	None	None	We study information design when there are multiple agents interacting in a game who are privately informed about their types. Each agent‚Äôs utility depends on all agents‚Äô types and actions, as well as (linearly) on the state. The optimal mechanism asks agents to report their types and then sends a private action recommendation to each agent which depends on all reported types and the state. We show that there always exists an optimal mechanism which is laminar partitional. Such a mechanism partitions the state space for each type profile and recommends the same action profile for states that belong to the same partition element. Furthermore, the convex hulls of any two partition elements are such that either one contains the other or they have an empty intersection. In the single-agent case, each state is either perfectly revealed or lies in an interval in which the number of different signal realizations is at most the number of different types of the agent plus two. A similar result is established for the multi-agent case.	
 Computing ùêø-Functions of Quadratic Characters at Negative Integers	Henri CohenUniversit de Bordeaux,Institut de Mathmatiques, UMR du CNRS, Cours de la Libration, TALENCE Cedex, FRANCE	None	None	We survey a number of different methods for computing L ( œá , 1 ‚àí k ) ùêø ùúí 1 ùëò L(\chi,1-k) italic_L ( italic_œá , 1 - italic_k ) for a Dirichlet character œá ùúí \chi italic_œá , with particular emphasis on quadratic characters. The main conclusion is that when k ùëò k italic_k is not too large (for instance k ‚â§ 100 ùëò 100 k\leq 100 italic_k ‚â§ 100 ) the best method comes from the use of Eisenstein series of half-integral weight, while when k ùëò k italic_k is large the best method is the use of the complete functional equation, unless the conductor of œá ùúí \chi italic_œá is really large, in which case the previous method again prevails.	
 Space-Time Quantum Metasurfaces	Wilton KortKamp, Abul Azad, Diego DalvitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Metasurfaces are a key photonic platform to manipulate classical light using sub-wavelength structures with designer optical response. Static metasurfaces have recently entered the realm of quantum photonics, showing their ability to tailor nonclassical states of light. We introduce the concept of space-time quantum metasurfaces for dynamical control of quantum light. We provide illustrative examples of the impact of spatio-temporally modulated metasurfaces in quantum photonics, including the creation of frequency-spin-path hyperentanglement on a single photon and the realization of space-time asymmetry at the deepest level of the quantum vacuum. Photonic platforms based on the space-time quantum metasurface concept have the potential to enable novel functionalities, such as on-demand entanglement generation for quantum communications, nonreciprocal photon propagation for free-space quantum isolation, and reconfigurable quantum imaging and sensing.	
 The Symmetry Basis of Pattern Formation in Reaction-Diffusion Networks	, Michael Norton, Bolun Chen, , , Jonathan Touboul, 	None	None	In networks of nonlinear oscillators, symmetries place hard constraints on the system that can be exploited to predict universal dynamical features and steady-states, providing a rare generic organizing principle for far-from-equilibrium systems. However, the robustness of this class of theories to symmetry-disrupting imperfections is untested. Here, we develop a model experimental reaction-diffusion network of chemical oscillators to test applications of this theory in the context of self-organizing systems relevant to biology and soft robotics. The network is a ring of 4 identical microreactors containing the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction coupled to nearest neighbors via diffusion. Assuming perfect symmetry, theory predicts 4 categories of stable spatiotemporal phase-locked periodic states and 4 categories of invariant manifolds that guide and structure transitions between phase-locked states. In our experiments, we observed the predicted symmetry-derived synchronous clustered transients that occur when the dynamical trajectories coincide with invariant manifolds. However, we observe only 3 of the 4 phase-locked states that are predicted for the idealized homogeneous system. Quantitative agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is found by accounting for the small amount of experimentally determined heterogeneity. This work demonstrates that a surprising degree of the network‚Äôs dynamics are constrained by symmetry in spite of the breakdown of the assumption of homogeneity and raises the question of why heterogeneity destabilizes some symmetry predicted states, but not others.	
 Randomized Deep Structured Prediction for Discourse-Level Processing	Manuel WidmoserstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMaria Leonor PachecostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTJean HonoriostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDan GoldwasserstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversity of Salzburg, AustriastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPurdue University, USA,	None	None	Expressive text encoders such as RNNs and Transformer Networks have been at the center of NLP models in recent work. Most of the effort has focused on sentence-level tasks, capturing the dependencies between words in a single sentence, or pairs of sentences. However, certain tasks, such as argumentation mining, require accounting for longer texts and complicated structural dependencies between them. Deep structured prediction is a general framework to combine the complementary strengths of expressive neural encoders and structured inference for highly structured domains. Nevertheless, when the need arises to go beyond sentences, most work relies on combining the output scores of independently trained classifiers. One of the main reasons for this is that constrained inference comes at a high computational cost. In this paper, we explore the use of randomized inference to alleviate this concern and show that we can efficiently leverage deep structured prediction and expressive neural encoders for a set of tasks involving complicated argumentative structures.	
 State Estimation for a Zero-Dimensional Electrochemical Model of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	Zhijia Huanga,a,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Dong Zhanga,a,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Luis Couto,b,bstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , italicb endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, QuanHong Yang,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Scott Moura,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have become one of the most attractive alternatives over conventional Li-ion batteries due to their high theoretical specific energy density (2500 Wh/kg for Li-S vs. ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 250 Wh/kg for Li-ion). Accurate state estimation in Li-S batteries is urgently needed for safe and efficient operation. To the best of the authors‚Äô knowledge, electrochemical model-based observers have not been reported for Li-S batteries, primarily due to the complex dynamics that make state observer design a challenging problem. In this work, we demonstrate a state estimation scheme based on a zero-dimensional electrochemical model for Li-S batteries. The nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model is incorporated into an extend Kalman filter. This observer design estimates both differential and algebraic states that represent the dynamic behavior inside the cell, from voltage and current measurements only. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation algorithm is illustrated by numerical simulation results. Our study unlocks how an electrochemical model can be utilized for practical state estimation of Li-S batteries.	
 High-fidelity Prediction of Megapixel Longitudinal Phase-space Images of Electron Beams using Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks	Zhu, Chen, Brinker, Decking, Tomin, Schlarb	None	None	Modeling of large-scale research facilities is extremely challenging due to complex physical processes and engineering problems. Here, we adopt a data-driven approach to model the longitudinal phase-space diagnostic beamline at the photoinector of the European XFEL with an encoder-decoder neural network model. A deep convolutional neural network (decoder) is used to build images measured on the screen from a small feature map generated by another neural network (encoder). We demonstrate that the model trained only with experimental data can make high-fidelity predictions of megapixel images for the longitudinal phase-space measurement without any prior knowledge of photoinjectors and electron beams. The prediction significantly outperforms existing methods. We also show the scalability and interpretability of the model by sharing the same decoder with more than one encoder used for different setups of the photoinjector, and propose a pragmatic way to model a facility with various diagnostics and working points. This opens the door to a new way of accurately modeling a photoinjector using neural networks and experimental data. The approach can possibly be extended to the whole accelerator and even other types of scientific facilities.	
 Persistent Covering of a Graph under Latency and Energy Constraints	JyhMing Lien, Sam Rodriguez, and Marco Morales	None	None	Most consumer-level low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have limited battery power and long charging time. Due to these energy constraints, they cannot accomplish many practical tasks, such as monitoring a sport or political event for hours. The problem of providing the service to cover an area for an extended time is known as persistent covering in the literature. In the past, researchers have proposed various hardware platforms, such as battery-swapping mechanisms, to provide persistent covering. However, algorithmic approaches are limited mostly due to the computational complexity and intractability of the problem. Approximation algorithms have been considered to segment a large area into smaller cells that require periodic visits under the latency constraints. However, these methods assume unlimited energy. In this paper, we explore geometric and topological properties that allow us to significantly reduce the size of the optimization problem. Consequently, the proposed method can efficiently determine the minimum number of UAVs needed and schedule their routes to cover an area persistently. We demonstrated experimentally that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the baseline methods.	
 A continuum and computational framework for viscoelastodynamics: finite deformation linear models	Ju Liu, Marcos Latorre, Alison Marsden	liuj36@sustech.edu.cn,liujuy@gmail.com	Department of Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518055, P.R.China	This work concerns the continuum basis and numerical formulation for deformable materials with viscous dissipative mechanisms. We derive a viscohyperelastic modeling framework based on fundamental thermomechanical principles. Since most large deformation problems exhibit isochoric properties, our modeling work is constructed based on the Gibbs free energy in order to develop a continuum theory using pressure-primitive variables, which is known to be well-behaved in the incompressible limit. A set of general evolution equations for the internal state variables is derived. With that, we focus on a family of free energies that leads to the so-called finite deformation linear model. Our derivation elucidates the origin of the evolution equations of that model, which was originally proposed heuristically and thus lacked formal compatibility with the underlying thermodynamics. In our derivation, the thermodynamic inconsistency is clarified and rectified. A classical model based on the identical polymer chain assumption is revisited and is found to have non-vanishing viscous stresses in the equilibrium limit, which is counter-intuitive in the physical sense. Because of that, we then discuss the relaxation property of the non-equilibrium stress in the thermodynamic equilibrium limit and its implication on the form of free energy. A modified version of the identical polymer chain model is then proposed, with a special case being the model proposed by G. Holzapfel and J. Simo. Based on the consistent modeling framework, a provably energy stable numerical scheme is constructed for incompressible viscohyperelasticity using inf-sup stable elements. In particular, we adopt a suite of smooth generalization of the Taylor-Hood element based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) for spatial discretization. The temporal discretization is performed via the generalized- Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± scheme. We present a suite of numerical results to corroborate the proposed numerical properties, including the nonlinear stability, robustness under large deformation, and the stress accuracy resolved by the higher-order elements. Additionally, the pathological behavior of the original identical polymer chain model is numerically identified with an unbounded energy decaying. This again underlines the importance of demanding vanishing non-equilibrium stress in the equilibrium limit.

 Towards glass-box CNNs	Piduguralla ManaswiniIndian Institute of Technology HyderabadJignesh BhattIndian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara	None	None	With the substantial performance of neural networks in sensitive fields increases the need for interpretable deep learning models. Major challenge is to uncover the multiscale and distributed representation hidden inside the basket mappings of the deep neural networks. Researchers have been trying to comprehend it through visual analysis of features, mathematical structures, or other data-driven approaches. Here, we work on implementation invariances of CNN-based representations and present an analytical binary prototype that provides useful insights for large scale real-life applications. We begin by unfolding conventional CNN and then repack it with a more transparent representation. Inspired by the attainment of neural networks, we choose to present our findings as a three-layer model. First is a representation layer that encompasses both the class information (group invariant) and symmetric transformations (group equivariant) of input images. Through these transformations, we decrease intra-class distance and increase the inter-class distance. It is then passed through a dimension reduction layer followed by a classifier. The proposed representation is compared with the equivariance of AlexNet (CNN) internal representation for better dissemination of simulation results. We foresee following immediate advantages of this toy version: i) contributes pre-processing of data to increase the feature or class separability in large scale problems, ii) helps designing neural architecture to improve the classification performance in multi-class problems, and iii) helps building interpretable CNN through scalable functional blocks.	
 GnetSeg: Semantic Segmentation Model Optimized on a 224mW CNN Accelerator Chip at the Speed of 318FPS	Baohua Sun, Weixiong Lin, Hao Sha, Jiapeng SuGyrfalcon Technology Inc McCarthy Blvd Suite , Milpitas, CA,	None	None	Semantic segmentation is the task to cluster pixels on an image belonging to the same class. It is widely used in the real-world applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging analysis, industrial inspection, smartphone camera for person segmentation and so on. Accelerating the semantic segmentation models on the mobile and edge devices are practical needs for the industry. Recent years have witnessed the wide availability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) accelerators. They have the advantages on power efficiency, inference speed, which are ideal for accelerating the semantic segmentation models on the edge devices. However, the CNN accelerator chips also have the limitations on flexibility and memory. In addition, the CPU load is very critical because the CNN accelerator chip works as a co-processor with a host CPU. In this paper, we optimize the semantic segmentation model in order to fully utilize the limited memory and the supported operators on the CNN accelerator chips, and at the same time reduce the CPU load of the CNN model to zero. The resulting model is called GnetSeg. Furthermore, we propose the integer encoding for the mask of the GnetSeg model, which minimizes the latency of data transfer between the CNN accelerator and the host CPU. The experimental result shows that the model running on the 224mW chip achieves the speed of 318FPS with excellent accuracy for applications such as person segmentation.	
 Dairy Cow rumination detection: A deep learning approach	Safa Ayadi, Ahmed ben said, Rateb Jabbar, Chafik Aloulou, Achraf Chabbouh, Ahmed Ben Achballah	None	None	Cattle activity is an essential index for monitoring health and welfare of the ruminants. Thus, changes in the livestock behavior are a critical indicator for early detection and prevention of several diseases. Rumination behavior is a significant variable for tracking the development and yield of animal husbandry. Therefore, various monitoring methods and measurement equipment have been used to assess cattle behavior. However, these modern attached devices are invasive, stressful and uncomfortable for the cattle and can influence negatively the welfare and diurnal behavior of the animal. Multiple research efforts addressed the problem of rumination detection by adopting new methods by relying on visual features. However, they only use few postures of the dairy cow to recognize the rumination or feeding behavior. In this study, we introduce an innovative monitoring method using Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning models. The classification process is conducted under two main labels: ruminating and other, using all cow postures captured by the monitoring camera. Our proposed system is simple and easy-to-use which is able to capture long-term dynamics using a compacted representation of a video in a single 2D image. This method proved efficiency in recognizing the rumination behavior with 95%, 98% and 98% of average accuracy, recall and precision, respectively.

Al-Naimi Petroleum Engineering Research Center, King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia.	At high temperature and pressure, solid diffusion and chemical reactions between rock minerals lead to phase transformations. Chemical transport during uphill diffusion causes phase separation, that is, spinodal decomposition. Thus, to describe the coarsening kinetics of the exsolution microstructure, we derive a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for the multicomponent Cahn‚ÄìHilliard equations while accounting for multiple chemical reactions and neglecting deformations. Our approach considers multiple balances of microforces augmented by multiple constituent content balance equations within an extended Larch√©‚ÄìCahn framework. As for the Larch√©‚ÄìCahn framework, we incorporate into the theory the Larch√©‚ÄìCahn derivatives with respect to the phase fields and their gradients. We also explain the implications of the resulting constrained gradients of the phase fields in the form of the gradient energy coefficients. Moreover, we derive a configurational balance that includes all the associated configurational fields in agreement with the Larch√©‚ÄìCahn framework. We study phase separation in a three-component system whose microstructural evolution depends upon the reaction-diffusion interactions and to analyze the underlying configurational fields. This simulation portrays the interleaving between the reaction and diffusion processes and how the configurational tractions drive the motion of interfaces.	
 Environment-Adaptive Multiple Access for Distributed V2X Network: A Reinforcement Learning Framework	Seungmo Kim,,, ByungJun Kim, and Brian Park,,	None	None	Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications amass research interest in recent days because of its ability to schedule multiple access more efficiently as compared to its predecessor technology, i.e., dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). However, the foremost issue still remains: a vehicle needs to keep the V2X performance in a highly dynamic environment. This paper proposes a way to exploit the dynamicity. That is, we propose a resource allocation mechanism adaptive to the environment, which can be an efficient solution for air interface congestion that a V2X network often suffers from. Specifically, the proposed mechanism aims at granting a higher chance of transmission to a vehicle with a higher crash risk. As such, the channel access is prioritized to those with urgent needs. The adaptation is implemented based on reinforcement learning (RL). We model the RL framework as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB), which provides efficiency as well as accuracy. We highlight the most superb aspect of the proposed mechanism: it is designed to be operated at a vehicle autonomously without need for any assistance from a central entity. Henceforth, the proposed framework is expected to make a particular fit to distributed V2X network such as C-V2X mode 4.	
 PolyLM: Learning about Polysemy through Language Modeling	Alan Ansell,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Felipe BravoMarquezstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Bernhard PfahringerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTLanguage Technology Lab, University of CambridgestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Computer Science, University of WaikatostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Computer Science, University of Chile IMFD	None	None	To avoid the ‚Äúmeaning conflation deficiency‚Äù of word embeddings, a number of models have aimed to embed individual word senses . These methods at one time performed well on tasks such as word sense induction (WSI), but they have since been overtaken by task-specific techniques which exploit contextualized embeddings. However, sense embeddings and contextualization need not be mutually exclusive. We introduce PolyLM, a method which formulates the task of learning sense embeddings as a language modeling problem, allowing contextualization techniques to be applied. PolyLM is based on two underlying assumptions about word senses: firstly, that the probability of a word occurring in a given context is equal to the sum of the probabilities of its individual senses occurring; and secondly, that for a given occurrence of a word, one of its senses tends to be much more plausible in the context than the others. We evaluate PolyLM on WSI, showing that it performs considerably better than previous sense embedding techniques, and matches the current state-of-the-art specialized WSI method despite having six times fewer parameters. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/AlanAnsell/PolyLM .	
 Towards Domain Invariant Single Image Dehazing	Pranjay ShyamKukJin YoonKyungsoo Kim	None	None	Presence of haze in images obscures underlying information, which is undesirable in applications requiring accurate environment information. To recover such an image, a dehazing algorithm should localize and recover affected regions while ensuring consistency between recovered and its neighboring regions. However owing to fixed receptive field of convolutional kernels and non uniform haze distribution, assuring consistency between regions is difficult. In this paper, we utilize an encoder-decoder based network architecture to perform the task of dehazing and integrate an spatially aware channel attention mechanism to enhance features of interest beyond the receptive field of traditional conventional kernels. To ensure performance consistency across diverse range of haze densities, we utilize greedy localized data augmentation mechanism. Synthetic datasets are typically used to ensure a large amount of paired training samples, however the methodology to generate such samples introduces a gap between them and real images while accounting for only uniform haze distribution and overlooking more realistic scenario of non-uniform haze distribution resulting in inferior dehazing performance when evaluated on real datasets. Despite this, the abundance of paired samples within synthetic datasets cannot be ignored. Thus to ensure performance consistency across diverse datasets, we train the proposed network within an adversarial prior-guided framework that relies on a generated image along with its low and high frequency components to determine if properties of dehazed images matches those of ground truth. We preform extensive experiments to validate the dehazing and domain invariance performance of proposed framework across diverse domains and report state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The source code with pretrained models will be available at https://github.com/PS06/DIDH.

With the recent breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI) brings more solid technology for complex problems like handwritten letter recognition and even automatic generation of them. In this research, we proposed deep learning framework called Ludwig AI Framework(LAIF) for Germany Suetterlin letter recognition and generation. To recognize Suetterlin letter, we proposed deep convolutional neural network. Since lack of big amount of data to train for the deep models and huge cost to label existing hard copy of handwritten letters, we also introduce the methodology with deep generative adversarial network to generate handwritten letters as synthetic data. Main source code is in https://github.com/enkhtogtokh/LAIF repository.	
 Evolution of Small Cell from 4G to 6G: Past, Present, and Future	Vanlin Sathya	None	Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, Illinois, USA.	To boost the cellular system‚Äôs capacity, the operator‚Äôs have started to reuse the same licensed spectrum by deploying 4G LTE small cells ( i.e., Femto Cells) in the past. But in time, these small cell licensed spectrum is not sufficient to satisfy future applications like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Hence, cellular operators look for alternate unlicensed spectrum in Wi-Fi 5 GHz band, later 3GPP named as LTE Licensed Assisted Access (LAA). The recent and current roll-out of LAA deployments (in developed nations like the US) provides an opportunity to understand coexistence‚Äôs profound ground truth. This paper discusses a high-level overview of my past, present, and future research works in the direction of small cell benefits. In the future, we shift the focus onto the latest unlicensed band: 6 GHz, where the latest Wi-Fi version, 802.11ax, will coexist with the latest cellular technology, 5G New Radio (NR) in unlicensed.	
 Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Monocular Depth Estimation Using Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization	Renya DaimostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Satoshi OnostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Takahiro SuzukistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	"11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Information Science and Biomedical Engineering,
Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Kagoshima University1-21-40, Korimoto, Ka"	This paper proposes an adversarial attack method to deep neural networks (DNNs) for monocular depth estimation, i.e., estimating the depth from a single image. Single image depth estimation has improved drastically in recent years due to the development of DNNs. However, vulnerabilities of DNNs for image classification have been revealed by adversarial attacks, and DNNs for monocular depth estimation could contain similar vulnerabilities. Therefore, research on vulnerabilities of DNNs for monocular depth estimation has spread rapidly, but many of them assume white-box conditions where inside information of DNNs is available, or are transferability-based black-box attacks that require a substitute DNN model and a training dataset. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, the proposed method in this paper analyzes DNNs under the black-box condition where only output depth maps are available. In addition, the proposed method does not require a substitute DNN that has a similar architecture to the target DNN nor any knowledge about training data used to train the target model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method succeeded in attacking two DNN-based methods that were trained with indoor and outdoor scenes respectively.	
 Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Comprehensive Survey	Abhilash Singh, Sandeep Sharma, Jitendra Singh	None	Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, India	In order to solve the critical issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), with concern for limited sensor lifetime, nature-inspired algorithms are emerging as a suitable method. Getting optimal network coverage is one of those challenging issues that need to be examined critically before any network setup. Optimal network coverage not only minimizes the consumption of limited energy of battery-driven sensors but also reduce the sensing of redundant information. In this paper, we focus on nature-inspired optimization algorithms concerning the optimal coverage in WSNs. In the first half of the paper, we have briefly discussed the taxonomy of the optimization algorithms along with the problem domains in WSNs. In the second half of the paper, we have compared the performance of two nature-inspired algorithms for getting optimal coverage in WSNs. The first one is a combined Improved Genetic Algorithm and Binary Ant Colony Algorithm (IGA-BACA), and the second one is Lion Optimization (LO). The simulation results confirm that LO gives better network coverage, and the convergence rate of LO is faster than that of IGA-BACA. Further, we observed that the optimal coverage is achieved at a lesser number of generations in LO as compared to IGA-BACA. This review will help researchers to explore the applications in this field as well as beyond this area.

 Frame based equipment channel access enhancements in NR unlicensed spectrum for the URLLC transmissions	TrungKien LedaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Umer Salim, Florian KaltenbergerdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in 5G New Radio has been originally defined only for licensed spectrum. However, due to new use cases in the Industry 4.0 scenarios, URLLC operation is currently being extended to unlicensed spectrum in the ongoing Release 17 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project. Although in such controlled environments we can guarantee the absence of any other technology sharing the channel on a long-term basis, the uncertainty of obtaining channel access through load based equipment (LBE) or frame based equipment (FBE) can impede with the latency requirements of URLLC. In FBE, the transmitters can be prioritized to support data with different requirements and have lower energy consumption and latency compared to LBE with a big contention window size. In this paper we analyze the performance of FBE in an unlicensed controlled environment through a Markov chain. Based on this analysis, we propose two schemes to improve the URLLC performance in FBE: The first scheme allows the transmitters to use multiple fixed frame period (FFP) configurations while the second scheme configures the FFP‚Äôs starting point of each transmitter based on its priority. The simulations show the benefits of these schemes compared to the URLLC transmission of existing schemes.	
 Poncelet Propellers: Invariant Total Blade Area	Dominique Laurain, Daniel Jaud, Dan Reznik	None	None	Given a triangle, a trio of circumellipses can be defined, each centered on an excenter. Over the family of Poncelet 3-periodics (triangles) in a concentric ellipse pair (axis-aligned or not), the trio resembles a rotating propeller, where each ‚Äúblade‚Äù has variable area. Amazingly, their total area is invariant, even when the ellipse pair is not axis-aligned. We also prove a closely-related invariant involving the sum of blade-to-excircle area ratios.

 Limit groups over coherent right-angled Artin groups are cyclic subgroup separable	Jonathan Fruchter	None	None	We prove that cyclic subgroup separability is preserved under exponential completion for groups that belong to a class that includes all coherent RAAGs and toral relatively hyperbolic groups; we do so by exploiting the structure of these completions as iterated free products with commuting subgroups. From this we deduce that the cyclic subgroups of limit groups over coherent RAAGs are separable, answering a question of Casals-Ruiz, Duncan and Kazachov. We also discuss relations between free products with commuting subgroups and the word problem, and recover the fact that limit groups over coherent RAAGs and toral relatively hyperbolic groups have a solvable word problem.	
 General Method for Classicality Certification in the Prepare and Measure Scenario	Carlos de Gois, George Moreno, Ranieri Nery, Samura Brito, Rafael Chaves, Rafael Rabelo	None	None	Preparation and measurement of physical systems are the operational building blocks of any physical experiment, and to describe them is the first purpose of any physical theory. It is remarkable that, in some situations, even when only preparation and measurement devices of a single system are present and they are uncharacterized, it is possible to distinguish between the behaviours of quantum and classical systems relying only on observational data. Certifying the physical origin of measurement statistics in the prepare and measure scenario is of primal importance for developing quantum networks, distributing quantum keys and certifying randomness, to mention a few applications, but, surprisingly, no general methods to do so are known. We progress on this problem by crafting a general, sufficient condition to certify that a given set of preparations can only generate classical statistics, for any number of generalized measurements. As an application, we employ the method to demonstrate non-classicality activation in the prepare and measure scenario, also considering its application in random access codes. Following that, we adapt our method to certify, again through a sufficient condition, whether a given set of measurements can never give rise to non-classical behaviors, irrespective of what preparations they may act upon. This, in turn, allows us to find a large set of incompatible measurements that cannot be used to demonstrate non-classicality, thus showing incompatibility is not sufficient for non-classicality in the prepare and measure scenario.	
 Temporal Latent Auto-Encoder: A Method for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Forecasting	Nam Nguyen, Brian Quanz	None	None	Probabilistic forecasting of high dimensional multivariate time series is a notoriously challenging task, both in terms of computational burden and distribution modeling. Most previous work either makes simple distribution assumptions or abandons modeling cross-series correlations. A promising line of work exploits scalable matrix factorization for latent-space forecasting, but is limited to linear embeddings, unable to model distributions, and not trainable end-to-end when using deep learning forecasting. We introduce a novel temporal latent auto-encoder method which enables nonlinear factorization of multivariate time series, learned end-to-end with a temporal deep learning latent space forecast model. By imposing a probabilistic latent space model, complex distributions of the input series are modeled via the decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on many popular multivariate datasets, with gains sometimes as high as 50 % percent 50 50\% 50 % for several standard metrics.

 Computing rational powers of monomial ideals	Pratik Dongre, Benjamin Drabkin, Josiah Lim, Ethan Partida, Ethan Roy, Dylan Ruff, Alexandra Seceleanu, Tingting Tang	mepratikdongre111@gmail.com	Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur	This paper concerns fractional powers of monomial ideals. Rational powers of a monomial ideal generalize the integral closure operation as well as recover the family of symbolic powers. They also highlight many interesting connections to the theory of convex polytopes. We provide multiple algorithms for computing the rational powers of a monomial ideal. We also introduce a mild generalization allowing real powers of monomial ideals. An important result is that given any monomial ideal I ùêº I italic_I , the function taking a real number to the corresponding real power of I ùêº I italic_I is a step function which is left continuous and has rational discontinuity points.	
 RTGPU: Real-Time GPU Scheduling of Hard Deadline Parallel Tasks with Fine-Grain Utilization	An Zou,Jing Li,Christopher Gill,andXuanZhang	None	None	Many emerging cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous vehicles and robots, rely heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to perform important system operations. Since these highly parallel applications are computationally intensive, they need to be accelerated by graphics processing units (GPUs) to meet stringent timing constraints. However, despite the wide adoption of GPUs, efficiently scheduling multiple GPU applications while providing rigorous real-time guarantees remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose RTGPU, which can schedule the execution of multiple GPU applications in real-time to meet hard deadlines. Each GPU application can have multiple CPU execution and memory copy segments, as well as GPU kernels. We start with a model to explicitly account for the CPU and memory copy segments of these applications. We then consider the GPU architecture in the development of a precise timing model for the GPU kernels and leverage a technique known as persistent threads to implement fine-grained kernel scheduling with improved performance through interleaved execution. Next, we propose a general method for scheduling parallel GPU applications in real time. Finally, to schedule multiple parallel GPU applications, we propose a practical real-time scheduling algorithm based on federated scheduling and grid search (for GPU kernel segments) with uniprocessor fixed priority scheduling (for multiple CPU and memory copy segments). Our approach provides superior schedulability compared with previous work, and gives real-time guarantees to meet hard deadlines for multiple GPU applications according to comprehensive validation and evaluation on a real NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU system.	
 Personal Data Access Control Through Distributed Authorization	Mirko Zichichi,Stefano Ferretti,Gabriele DAngelo,Vctor RodrguezDoncel	None	None	This paper presents an architecture of a Personal Information Management System, in which individuals can define the access to their personal data by means of smart contracts. These smart contracts, running on the Ethereum blockchain, implement access control lists and grant immutability, traceability and verifiability of the references to personal data, which is stored itself in a (possibly distributed) file system. A distributed authorization mechanism is devised, where trust from multiple network nodes is necessary to grant the access to the data. To this aim, two possible alternatives are described: a Secret Sharing scheme and Threshold Proxy Re-Encryption scheme. The performance of these alternatives is experimentally compared in terms of execution time. Threshold Proxy Re-Encryption appears to be faster in different scenarios, in particular when increasing message size, number of nodes and the threshold value, i.e. number of nodes needed to grant the data disclosure.	
 Identifying acoustic wave sources on the Sun I. Two-dimensional waves in a simulated photosphere	Shah Mohammad Bahauddin, Mark Peter Rast	None	None	The solar acoustic oscillations are likely stochastically excited by convective dynamics in the solar photosphere, though few direct observations of individual source events have been made and their detailed characteristics are still unknown. Wave source identification requires measurements that can reliably discriminate the local wave signal from the background convective motions and resonant modal power. This is quite challenging as these ‚Äônoise‚Äô contributions have amplitudes several orders of magnitude greater than the sources and the propagating wave fields they induce. In this paper, we employ a high-temporal-frequency filter to identify sites of acoustic emission in a radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The properties of the filter were determined from a convolutional neural network trained to identify the two-dimensional acoustic Green‚Äôs function response of the atmosphere, but once defined, it can be directly applied to an image time series to extract the signal of local wave excitation, bypassing the need for the original neural network. Using the filter developed, we have uncovered previously unknown properties of the acoustic emission process. In the simulation, acoustic events are found to be clustered at mesogranular scales, with peak emission quite deep, about 500 km below the photosphere, and sites of very strong emission can result from the interaction of two supersonic downflows that merge at that depth. We suggest that the method developed, when applied to high-resolution high-cadence observations, such as those forthcoming with Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), will have important applications in chromospheric wave-studies and may lead to new investigations in high-resolution local-helioseismology.	
 A regression framework for a probabilistic measure of cost-effectiveness	Nicholas Illenberger, Nandita Mitra, Andrew Spieker	None	None	To make informed health policy decisions regarding a treatment, we must consider both its cost and its clinical effectiveness. In past work, we introduced the net benefit separation (NBS) as a novel measure of cost-effectiveness. The NBS is a probabilistic measure that characterizes the extent to which a treated patient will be more likely to experience benefit as compared to an untreated patient. Due to variation in treatment response across patients, uncovering factors that influence cost-effectiveness can assist policy makers in population-level decisions regarding resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce a regression framework for NBS in order to estimate covariate-specific NBS and find determinants of variation in NBS. Our approach is able to accommodate informative cost censoring through inverse probability weighting techniques, and addresses confounding through a semiparametric standardization procedure. Through simulations, we show that NBS regression performs well in a variety of common scenarios. We apply our proposed regression procedure to a realistic simulated data set as an illustration of how our approach could be used to investigate the association between cancer stage, comorbidities and cost-effectiveness when comparing adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy in post-hysterectomy endometrial cancer patients.	
 Non-embeddable II‚ÇÅ factors resembling the hyperfinite II‚ÇÅ factor	Isaac Goldbring	isaac@math.uci.edu	"Department of MathematicsUniversity of California, Irvine, 340 Rowland Hall (Bldg.# 400),
Irvine, CA 92697-3875"	We consider various statements that characterize the hyperfinite II 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT factors amongst embeddable II 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT factors in the non-embeddable situation. In particular, we show that ‚Äúgenerically‚Äù a II 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT factor has the Jung property (which states that every embedding of itself into its ultrapower is unitarily conjugate to the diagonal embedding) if and only if it is self-tracially stable (which says that every such embedding has an approximate lifting). We prove that the enforceable factor, should it exist, has these equivalent properties. Our techniques are model-theoretic in nature. We also show how these techniques can be used to give new proofs that the hyperfinite II 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT factor has the aforementioned properties.	
 Strategies for the Construction of Machine-Learning Potentials for Accurate and Efficient Atomic-Scale Simulations	April Miksch, Tobias Morawietz, Johannes Kstner, Alexander Urban, Nongnuch Artrith,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	miksch@theochem.uni-stuttgart.de	None	Recent advances in machine-learning interatomic potentials have enabled the efficient modeling of complex atomistic systems with an accuracy that is comparable to that of conventional quantum-mechanics based methods. At the same time, the construction of new machine-learning potentials can seem a daunting task, as it involves data-science techniques that are not yet common in chemistry and materials science. Here, we provide a tutorial-style overview of strategies and best practices for the construction of artificial neural network (ANN) potentials. We illustrate the most important aspects of (i) data collection, (ii) model selection, (iii) training and validation, and (iv) testing and refinement of ANN potentials on the basis of practical examples. Current research in the areas of active learning and delta learning are also discussed in the context of ANN potentials. This tutorial review aims at equipping computational chemists and materials scientists with the required background knowledge for ANN potential construction and application, with the intention to accelerate the adoption of the method, so that it can facilitate exciting research that would otherwise be challenging with conventional strategies.	
 Probing electroweak phase transition with multi-TeV muon colliders and gravitational waves	Wei Liu, KePan Xie	None	None	We study the complementarity of the proposed multi-TeV muon colliders and the near-future gravitational wave (GW) detectors to the first order electroweak phase transition (FOEWPT), taking the real scalar extended Standard Model as the representative model. A detailed collider simulation shows the FOEWPT parameter space can be greatly probed via the the vector boson fusion production of the singlet, and its subsequent decay to the di-Higgs or di-boson channels. Especially, almost all the parameter space yielding detectable GW signals can be probed by the muon colliders. Therefore, if we could detect stochastic GWs in the future, a muon collider could provide a hopeful crosscheck to identify their origin. On the other hand, there is considerable parameter space that escapes GW detections but is within the reach of the muon colliders. The precision measurements of Higgs couplings could also probe the FOEWPT parameter space efficiently.

 Classification of Schizophrenia from Functional MRI Using Large-scale Extended Granger Causality	Axel Wismller, , Ali Vosoughi	None	None	The literature manifests that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in brain network connectivity. We investigate whether large-scale Extended Granger Causality (lsXGC) can capture such alterations using resting-state fMRI data. Our method utilizes dimension reduction combined with the augmentation of source time-series in a predictive time-series model for estimating directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. The lsXGC is a multivariate approach since it identifies the relationship of the underlying dynamic system in the presence of all other time-series. Here lsXGC serves as a biomarker for classifying schizophrenia patients from typical controls using a subset of 62 subjects from the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) data repository. We use brain connections estimated by lsXGC as features for classification. After feature extraction, we perform feature selection by Kendall‚Äôs tau rank correlation coefficient followed by classification using a support vector machine. As a reference method, we compare our results with cross-correlation, typically used in the literature as a standard measure of functional connectivity. We cross-validate 100 different training/test (90%/10%) data split to obtain mean accuracy and a mean Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) across all tested numbers of features for lsXGC. Our results demonstrate a mean accuracy range of [0.767, 0.940] and a mean AUC range of [0.861, 0.983] for lsXGC. The result of lsXGC is significantly higher than the results obtained with the cross-correlation, namely mean accuracy of [0.721, 0.751] and mean AUC of [0.744, 0.860]. Our results suggest the applicability of lsXGC as a potential biomarker for schizophrenia.	
 Appliance Operation Modes Identification Using Cycles Clustering	Abdelkareem Jaradat, Hanan Lutfiyya, Anwar Haqueajarada, hlutfiyy, ahaqueuwocaThe University Of Western Ontario Department Of Computer ScienceLondon, Ontario, Canada	None	None	The increasing cost, energy demand, and environmental issues has led many researchers to find approaches for energy monitoring, and hence energy conservation. The emerging technologies of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) deliver techniques that have the potential to efficiently conserve energy and improve the utilization of energy consumption. Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMSs) have the potential to contribute in energy conservation through the application of Demand Response (DR) in the residential sector. In this paper, we propose appliances Operation Modes Identification using Cycles Clustering (OMICC) which is SHEMS fundamental approach that utilizes the sensed residential disaggregated power consumption in supporting DR by providing consumers the opportunity to select lighter appliance operation modes. The cycles of the Single Usage Profile (SUP) of an appliance are extracted and reformed into features in terms of clusters of cycles. These features are then used to identify the operation mode used in every occurrence using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Operation modes identification is considered a basis for many potential smart DR applications within SHEMS towards the consumers or the suppliers.	
 Constant Amortized Time Enumeration of Eulerian trails	Kazuhiro Kurita, Kunihiro Wasa	None	None	In this paper, we consider enumeration problems for edge-distinct and vertex-distinct Eulerian trails. Here, two Eulerian trails are edge-distinct if the edge sequences are not identical, and they are vertex-distinct if the vertex sequences are not identical. As the main result, we propose optimal enumeration algorithms for both problems, that is, these algorithm runs in ùí™ ( N ) ùí™ ùëÅ \mathcal{O}(N) caligraphic_O ( italic_N ) total time, where N ùëÅ N italic_N is the number of solutions. Our algorithms are based on the reverse search technique introduced by [Avis and Fukuda, DAM 1996], and the push out amortization technique introduced by [Uno, WADS 2015].	
 Towards an Open Format for Scalable System Telemetry	Teryl Taylordagger, Frederico Araujodagger, Xiaokui Shu	None	None	A data representation for system behavior telemetry for scalable big data security analytics is presented, affording telemetry consumers comprehensive visibility into workloads at reduced storage and processing overheads. The new abstraction, SysFlow, is a compact open data format that lifts the representation of system activities into a flow-centric, object-relational mapping that records how applications interact with their environment, relating processes to file accesses, network activities, and runtime information. The telemetry format supports single-event and volumetric flow representations of process control flows, file interactions, and network communications. Evaluation on enterprise-grade benchmarks shows that SysFlow facilitates deeper introspection into attack kill chains while yielding traces orders of magnitude smaller than current state-of-the-art system telemetry approaches‚Äîdrastically reducing storage requirements and enabling feature-filled system analytics, process-level provenance tracking, and long-term data archival for cyber threat discovery and forensic analysis on historical data.	
 Neutrino non-standard interactions meet precision measurements of ùëµ_ùêûùêüùêü	Yong Du, JiangHao Yu	None	None	The number of relativistic species, N eff subscript ùëÅ eff N_{\rm eff} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , has been precisely calculated in the standard model, and would be measured to the percent level by CMB-S4 in future. Neutral-current non-standard interactions would affect neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, thus modifying N eff subscript ùëÅ eff N_{\rm eff} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . We parameterize those operators up to dimension-7 in the effective field theory framework, and then provide a complete, generic and analytical dictionary for the collision term integrals. From precision measurements of N eff subscript ùëÅ eff N_{\rm eff} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , the most stringent constraint is obtained for the dimension-6 vector-type neutrino-electron operator, whose scale is constrained to be above about 195 (331) GeV from Planck (CMB-S4). We find our results complementary to other experiments like neutrino coherent scattering, neutrino oscillation, collider, and neutrino deep inelastic scattering experiments.	
 Physics potential of a muon-proton collider	Kingman Cheung, Zeren Simon Wang	cheung@phys.nthu.edu.tw	None	We propose a muon-proton collider with asymmetrical multi-TeV beam energies and integrated luminosities of 0.1 ‚àí 1 0.1 1 0.1-1 0.1 - 1 ab ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT . With its large center-of-mass energies and yet small Standard Model background, such a machine can not only improve electroweak precision measurements but also probe new physics beyond the Standard Model to an unprecedented level. We study its potential in measuring the Higgs properties, probing the R-parity-violating Supersymmetry, as well as testing heavy new physics in the muon g ‚àí 2 ùëî 2 g-2 italic_g - 2 anomaly. We find that for these physics cases the muon-proton collider can perform better than both the ongoing and future high-energy collider experiments.	
 On the Hardy number of comb domains	Christina Karafyllia	christina.karafyllia@stonybrook.edu	Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, U.S.A.	Let H p ( ùîª ) superscript ùêª ùëù ùîª {H^{p}}\left(\mathbb{D}\right) italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( blackboard_D ) be the Hardy space of all holomorphic functions on the unit disk ùîª ùîª \mathbb{D} blackboard_D with exponent p > 0 ùëù 0 p>0 italic_p > 0 . If D ‚â† ‚ÑÇ ùê∑ ‚ÑÇ D\neq\mathbb{C} italic_D ‚â† blackboard_C is a simply connected domain and f ùëì f italic_f is the Riemann mapping from ùîª ùîª \mathbb{D} blackboard_D onto D ùê∑ D italic_D , then the Hardy number of D ùê∑ D italic_D , introduced by Hansen, is the supremum of all p ùëù p italic_p for which f ‚àà H p ( ùîª ) ùëì superscript ùêª ùëù ùîª f\in{H^{p}}\left(\mathbb{D}\right) italic_f ‚àà italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( blackboard_D ) . Comb domains are a well-studied class of simply connected domains that, in general, have the form of the entire plane minus an infinite number of vertical rays. In this paper we study the Hardy number of a class of comb domains with the aid of the quasi-hyperbolic distance and we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hardy number of these domains to be equal to infinity. Applying this condition, we derive several results that show how the mutual distances and the distribution of the rays affect the finiteness of the Hardy number. By a result of Burkholder our condition is also necessary and sufficient for all moments of the exit time of Brownian motion from comb domains to be infinite.	
 A unifying algebraic framework for discontinuous Galerkin and flux reconstruction methods based on the summation-by-parts property	Tristan Montoya, David WZingg	None	None	We propose a unifying framework for the matrix-based formulation and analysis of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and flux reconstruction (FR) methods for conservation laws on general unstructured grids. Within such an algebraic framework, the multidimensional summation-by-parts (SBP) property is used to establish the discrete equivalence of strong and weak formulations, as well as the conservation and energy stability properties of a broad class of DG and FR schemes. Specifically, the analysis enables the extension of the equivalence between the strong and weak forms of the discontinuous Galerkin collocation spectral-element method demonstrated by Kopriva and Gassner (J Sci Comput 44:136‚Äì155, 2010) to more general nodal and modal DG formulations, as well as to the Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh (VCJH) family of FR methods. Moreover, new algebraic proofs of conservation and energy stability for DG and VCJH schemes with respect to suitable quadrature rules and discrete norms are presented, in which the SBP property serves as a unifying mechanism for establishing such results. Numerical experiments are provided for the two-dimensional linear advection and Euler equations, highlighting the design choices afforded for methods within the proposed framework and corroborating the theoretical analysis.	
 A Monad for Probabilistic Point Processes	Swaraj Dash Sam Staton	swaraj.dash@cs.ox.ac.uk ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉsam.staton@cs.ox.ac.uk	None	A point process on a space is a random bag of elements of that space. In this paper we explore programming with point processes in a monadic style. To this end we identify point processes on a space X ùëã X italic_X with probability measures of bags of elements in X ùëã X italic_X . We describe this view of point processes using the composition of the Giry and bag monads on the category of measurable spaces and functions and prove that this composition also forms a monad using a distributive law for monads. Finally, we define a morphism from a point process to its intensity measure, and show that this is a monad morphism. A special case of this monad morphism gives us Wald‚Äôs Lemma, an identity used to calculate the expected value of the sum of a random number of random variables. Using our monad we define a range of point processes and point process operations and compositionally compute their corresponding intensity measures using the monad morphism.	
 Symmetric Monoidal Categories with Attributes	Spencer Breiner, John SNolan	Spencer.Breiner@nist.gov	None	When designing plans in engineering, it is often necessary to consider attributes associated to objects, e.g. the location of a robot. Our aim in this paper is to incorporate attributes into existing categorical formalisms for planning, namely those based on symmetric monoidal categories and string diagrams. To accomplish this, we define a notion of a ‚Äúsymmetric monoidal category with attributes.‚Äù This is a symmetric monoidal category in which objects are equipped with retrievable information and where the interactions between objects and information are governed by an ‚Äúattribute structure.‚Äù We discuss examples and semantics of such categories in the context of robotics to illustrate our definition.	
 A diagrammatic approach to symmetric lenses	Bryce Clarke	bryce.clarke1@hdr.mq.edu.au	None	Lenses are a mathematical structure for maintaining consistency between a pair of systems. In their ongoing research program, Johnson and Rosebrugh have sought to unify the treatment of symmetric lenses with spans of asymmetric lenses. This paper presents a diagrammatic approach to symmetric lenses between categories, through representing the propagation operations with Mealy morphisms. The central result of this paper is to demonstrate that the bicategory of symmetric lenses is locally adjoint to the bicategory of spans of asymmetric lenses, through constructing an explicit adjoint triple between the hom-categories.	
 The more legs the merrier: A new composition for symmetric (multi-)lenses	Michael Johnson, Robert Rosebrugh	michael.johnson@mq.edu.au	None	This paper develops a new composition of symmetric lenses that preserves information which is important for implementing system interoperation. It includes a cut-down but realistic example of a multi-system business supply chain and illustrates the new mathematical content with analysis of the systems, showing how the new composition facilitates the engineering required to implement the interoperations. All of the concepts presented here are based on either pure category theory or on experience in solving business problems using applied category theory.

 Categorical Vector Space Semantics for Lambek Calculus with a Relevant Modality (Extended Abstract)	Lachlan McPheatMehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, Hadi Wazni, Gijs Wijnholds	{m.sadrzadeh,l.mcpheat}@ucl.ac.uk	None	We develop a categorical compositional distributional semantics for Lambek Calculus with a Relevant Modality, ! ùêã * \mathbf{!L^{*}} ! bold_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , which has a limited version of the contraction and permutation rules. The categorical part of the semantics is a monoidal biclosed category with a coalgebra modality as defined on Differential Categories. We instantiate this category to finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps via ‚Äúquantisation‚Äù functors and work with three concrete interpretations of the coalgebra modality. We apply the model to construct categorical and concrete semantic interpretations for the motivating example of ! ùêã * \mathbf{!L^{*}} ! bold_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT : the derivation of a phrase with a parasitic gap. The effectiveness of the concrete interpretations are evaluated via a disambiguation task, on an extension of a sentence disambiguation dataset to parasitic gap phrases, using BERT, Word2Vec, and FastText vectors and Relational tensors.	
 Proof Theory of Partially Normal Skew Monoidal Categories	Tarmo Uustalu, Niccol Veltri, Noam Zeilberger	tarmo@ru.is	None	The skew monoidal categories of Szlach√°nyi are a weakening of monoidal categories where the three structural laws of left and right unitality and associativity are not required to be isomorphisms but merely transformations in a particular direction. In previous work, we showed that the free skew monoidal category on a set of generating objects can be concretely presented as a sequent calculus. This calculus enjoys cut elimination and admits focusing, i.e. a subsystem of canonical derivations, which solves the coherence problem for skew monoidal categories.

 Operations on Metric Thickenings	Henry Adams Johnathan Bush Joshua Mirth	{lastname}@math.colostate.edu	None	Many simplicial complexes arising in practice have an associated metric space structure on the vertex set but not on the complex, e.g. the Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex in applied topology. We formalize a remedy by introducing a category of simplicial metric thickenings whose objects have a natural realization as metric spaces. The properties of this category allow us to prove that, for a large class of thickenings including Vietoris‚ÄìRips and ƒåech thickenings, the product of metric thickenings is homotopy equivalent to the metric thickenings of product spaces, and similarly for wedge sums.	
 Behavioral Mereology: A Modal Logic for Passing Constraints	Brendan Fong, David Jaz Myers, David Spivak	None	None	Mereology is the study of parts and the relationships that hold between them. We introduce a behavioral approach to mereology, in which systems and their parts are known only by the types of behavior they can exhibit. Our discussion is formally topos-theoretic, and agnostic to the topos, providing maximal generality; however, by using only its internal logic we can hide the details and readers may assume a completely elementary set-theoretic discussion. We consider the relationship between various parts of a whole in terms of how behavioral constraints are passed between them, and give an inter-modal logic that generalizes the usual alethic modalities in the setting of symmetric accessibility.

 Fast Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Two-step Deep Remapping	Dayu ZhuGeorgia Institute of Technology, Wenshan CaiGeorgia Institute of Technology	None	None	Conventional imaging only records photons directly sent from the object to the detector, while non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging takes the indirect light into account. Most NLOS solutions employ a transient scanning process, followed by a physical based algorithm to reconstruct the NLOS scenes. However, the transient detection requires sophisticated apparatus, with long scanning time and low robustness to ambient environment, and the reconstruction algorithms are typically time-consuming and computationally expensive. Here we propose a new NLOS solution to address the above defects, with innovations on both equipment and algorithm. We apply inexpensive commercial Lidar for detection, with much higher scanning speed and better compatibility to real-world imaging. Our reconstruction framework is deep learning based, with a generative two-step remapping strategy to guarantee high reconstruction fidelity. The overall detection and reconstruction process allows for millisecond responses, with reconstruction precision of millimeter level. We have experimentally tested the proposed solution on both synthetic and real objects, and further demonstrated our method to be applicable to full-color NLOS imaging.	
 Dualizing sup-preserving endomaps of a complete lattice	Luigi Santocanale	luigi.santocanale@lis-lab.fr	None	It is argued in [ 6 ] that the quantale [ L , L ] ‚à® subscript ùêø ùêø [L,L]_{\vee} [ italic_L , italic_L ] start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚à® end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of sup-preserving endomaps of a complete lattice L ùêø L italic_L is a Girard quantale exactly when L ùêø L italic_L is completely distributive. We have argued in [ 17 ] that this Girard quantale structure arises from the dual quantale of inf-preserving endomaps of L ùêø L italic_L via Raney‚Äôs transforms and extends to a Girard quantaloid structure on the full subcategory of SLatt (the category of complete lattices and sup-preserving maps) whose objects are the completely distributive lattices.	
 Products in a Category with Only One Object	Rick Statman	rs31@webmail.math.cmu.edu	None	We consider certain decision problems for the free model of the theory of Cartesian monoids.

 Transparency in Multi-Human Multi-Robot Interaction	Jayam PatelstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tyagaraja RamaswamystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Zhi ListartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Carlo PincirolistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Transparency is a key factor in the performance of human-robot interaction. A transparent interface allows operators to be aware of the state of a robot and to assess the progress of the tasks at hand. When multi-robot systems are involved, transparency is a greater challenge, due to the larger number of variables affecting the behavior of the robots as a whole. Existing work studies transparency with single operators and multiple robots. Studies on transparency that focus on multiple operators interacting with a multi-robot systems are limited. This paper fills this gap by presenting a novel human-swarm interface for multiple operators. Through this interface, we study which graphical elements are contributing to multi-operator transparency by comparing four ‚Äútransparency modes‚Äù: (i) no transparency (no operator receives information from the robots), (ii) central transparency (the operators receive information only relevant to their personal task), (iii) peripheral transparency (the operators share information on each others‚Äô tasks), and (iv) mixed transparency (both central and peripheral). We report the results in terms of awareness, trust, and workload from a user study involving 18 participants engaged in a complex multi-robot task.

 LA-UR-20-25546Dislocation drag and its influence on elastic precursor decay	Daniel Blaschke and Darby Luscher	None	None	Plastic deformation is mediated by the creation and movement of dislocations, and at high stress the latter is dominated by dislocation drag from phonon wind. By simulating a 1-D shock impact problem we analyze the importance of accurately modeling dislocation drag and dislocation density evolution in the high stress regime. Dislocation drag is modeled according to a first-principles derivation as a function of stress and dislocation character, and its temperature and density dependence are approximated to the extent currently known. Much less is known about dislocation density evolution, leading to far greater uncertainty in these model parameters. In studying anisotropic fcc metals with character dependent dislocations, the present work generalizes similar earlier studies by other authors.	
 DNC-Aided SCL-Flip Decoding of Polar Codes Yaoyu Tao^{1,2}, and Zhengya Zhang¬π,	, 	None	None	Successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding of polar codes has been adopted for 5G. However, the performance is not very satisfactory with moderate code length. Heuristic or deep-learning-aided (DL-aided) flip algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem. The key for successful flip decoding is to accurately identify error bit positions. In this work, we propose a new flip algorithm with help of differentiable neural computer (DNC). New state and action encoding are developed for better DNC training and inference efficiency. The proposed method consists of two phases: i) a flip DNC (F-DNC) is exploited to rank most likely flip positions for multi-bit flipping; ii) if decoding still fails, a flip-validate DNC (FV-DNC) is used to re-select error bit positions for successive flip decoding trials. Supervised training methods are designed accordingly for the two DNCs. Simulation results show that proposed DNC-aided SCL-Flip (DNC-SCLF) decoding demonstrates up to 0.34dB coding gain improvement or 54.2% reduction in average number of decoding attempts compared to prior works.	
 Non-linear Plane Gravitational Waves as Space-time Defects	Carneiro, Ulhoa, Maluf, da RochaNeto	fernandolessa45@gmail.com	None	We consider non-linear plane gravitational waves as propagating space-time defects, and construct the Burgers vector of the waves. In the context of classical continuum systems, the Burgers vector is a measure of the deformation of the medium, and at a microscopic (atomic) scale, it is a naturally quantized object. One purpose of the present article is ultimately to probe an alternative way on how to quantize plane gravitational waves.

 Model-agnostic interpretation by visualization of feature perturbations	Wilson MarclioJr, Danilo Eler, Fabrcio Breve	None	Faculty of Sciences and Technology, S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP), Presidente Prudente, SP 19060-900, Brazil	Interpretation of machine learning models has become one of the most important research topics due to the necessity of maintaining control and avoiding bias in these algorithms. Since many machine learning algorithms are published every day, there is a need for novel model-agnostic interpretation approaches that could be used to interpret a great variety of algorithms. Thus, one advantageous way to interpret machine learning models is to feed different input data to understand the changes in the prediction. Using such an approach, practitioners can define relations among data patterns and a model‚Äôs decision. This work proposes a model-agnostic interpretation approach that uses visualization of feature perturbations induced by the PSO algorithm. We validate our approach on publicly available datasets, showing the capability to enhance the interpretation of different classifiers while yielding very stable results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.	
 Human Centric Accessibility Graph For Environment Analysis	Mathew Schwartz	None	New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA	Understanding design decisions in relation to the future occupants of a building is a crucial part of good design. However, limitations in tools and expertise hinder meaningful human-centric decisions during the design process. In this paper, a novel Spatial Human Accessibility graph for Planning and Environment Analysis (SHAPE) is introduced that brings together the technical challenges of discrete representations of digital models, with human-based metrics for evaluating the environment. SHAPE: does not need labeled geometry as input, works with multi-level buildings, captures surface variations (e.g., slopes in a terrain), and can be used with existing graph theory (e.g., gravity, centrality) techniques. SHAPE uses ray-casting to perform a search, generating a dense graph of all accessible locations within the environment and storing the type of travel required in a graph (e.g., up a slope, down a step). The ability to simultaneously evaluate and plan paths from multiple human factors is shown to work on digital models across room, building, and topography scales. The results enable designers and planners to evaluate options of the built environment in new ways, and at higher fidelity, that will lead to more human-friendly and accessible environments.	
 On the Evaluation of Vision-and-Language Navigation Instructions	Ming Zhao Peter Anderson Vihan Jain Su WangGoogle Research	None	None	Vision-and-Language Navigation wayfinding agents can be enhanced by exploiting automatically generated navigation instructions. However, existing instruction generators have not been comprehensively evaluated, and the automatic evaluation metrics used to develop them have not been validated. Using human wayfinders, we show that these generators perform on par with or only slightly better than a template-based generator and far worse than human instructors. Furthermore, we discover that BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR and CIDEr are ineffective for evaluating grounded navigation instructions. To improve instruction evaluation, we propose an instruction-trajectory compatibility model that operates without reference instructions. Our model shows the highest correlation with human wayfinding outcomes when scoring individual instructions. For ranking instruction generation systems, if reference instructions are available we recommend using SPICE.	
 Multi-messenger Astrophysics with the Pierre Auger Observatory	Michael SchimpstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTfor the Pierre Auger CollaborationstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	auger_spokespersons@fnal.gov	None	While the Pierre Auger Observatory is a very successful instrument for ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) detection, it is increasingly used as part of various types of multi-messenger searches, in which it contributes with searches for air showers induced by atomic nuclei, neutrons, photons, and neutrinos. We present an overview of the multi-messenger activities of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

 Finite Sample Analysis of Two-Time-Scale Natural Actor-Critic Algorithm	Sajad Khodadadianlabele, markskhodadadiangatechedu, Thinh Doanlabele, markthinhdoanvtedu, Justin Romberglabele, markjromecegatechedu, Siva Theja Magulurilabele, marksivathejagatechedu	None	Geogia Institute of Technology,	Actor-critic style two-time-scale algorithms are one of the most popular methods in reinforcement learning, and have seen great empirical success. However, their performance is not completely understood theoretically. In this paper, we characterize the global convergence of an online natural actor-critic algorithm in the tabular setting using a single trajectory of samples. Our analysis applies to very general settings, as we only assume ergodicity of the underlying Markov decision process. In order to ensure enough exploration, we employ an œµ italic-œµ \epsilon italic_œµ -greedy sampling of the trajectory.	
 Relation between non trivial M2-branes and D2-branes with fluxes	Garcia del Moral,a,astartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Las Heras,b,bstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , italicb endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartamento de F√≠sica, Universidad de Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile.

The first two exhibit a purely discrete supersymmetric spectrum once the central charge condition, or equivalently, the corresponding flux condition has been turned on.

 Insights into the Electron-Electron Interaction from Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations	Carl Kukkonen, Kun Chen	kukkonen@cox.net	None	The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on both the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the effective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the electron gas at metallic densities.	
 Continual Learning of Visual Concepts for Robots through Limited Supervision	Ali Ayub, Alan Wagner	aja5755@psu.edu	None	For many real-world robotics applications, robots need to continually adapt and learn new concepts. Further, robots need to learn through limited data because of scarcity of labeled data in the real-world environments. To this end, my research focuses on developing robots that continually learn in dynamic unseen environments/scenarios, learn from limited human supervision, remember previously learned knowledge and use that knowledge to learn new concepts. I develop machine learning models that not only produce State-of-the-results on benchmark datasets but also allow robots to learn new objects and scenes in unconstrained environments which lead to a variety of novel robotics applications.	
 A Certainty Equivalent Merton Problem	Nicholas Moehle, Stephen Boyd	None	None	The Merton problem is the well-known stochastic control problem of choosing consumption over time, as well as an investment mix, to maximize expected constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility of consumption. Merton formulated the problem and provided an analytical solution in 1970; since then a number of extensions of the original formulation have been solved. In this note we identify a certainty equivalent problem, i.e. , a deterministic optimal control problem with the same optimal value function and optimal policy, for the base Merton problem, as well as a number of extensions. When time is discretized, the certainty equivalent problem becomes a second-order cone program (SOCP), readily formulated and solved using domain specific languages for convex optimization. This makes it a good starting point for model predictive control, a policy that can handle extensions that are either too cumbersome or impossible to handle exactly using standard dynamic programming methods.	
 Generic Event Boundary Detection: A Benchmark for Event Segmentation	Mike Zheng Shou, Stan Weixian Lei, Weiyao Wang, Deepti Ghadiyaram, Matt Feiszli	None	None	This paper presents a novel task together with a new benchmark for detecting generic, taxonomy-free event boundaries that segment a whole video into chunks. Conventional work in temporal video segmentation and action detection focuses on localizing pre-defined action categories and thus does not scale to generic videos. Cognitive Science has known since last century that humans consistently segment videos into meaningful temporal chunks. This segmentation happens naturally, without pre-defined event categories and without being explicitly asked to do so. Here, we repeat these cognitive experiments on mainstream CV datasets; with our novel annotation guideline which addresses the complexities of taxonomy-free event boundary annotation, we introduce the task of Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) and the new benchmark Kinetics-GEBD . We view GEBD as an important stepping stone towards understanding the video as a whole, and believe it has been previously neglected due to a lack of proper task definition and annotations. Through experiment and human study we demonstrate the value of the annotations. Further, we benchmark supervised and un-supervised GEBD approaches on the TAPOS dataset and our Kinetics-GEBD. We release our annotations and baseline codes at CVPR‚Äô21 LOVEU Challenge : https://sites.google.com/view/loveucvpr21 .

 How Good is a Video Summary? A New Benchmarking Dataset and Evaluation Framework Towards Realistic Video Summarization	Vishal Kaushal, Suraj Kothawade, Anshul Tomar, Rishabh Iyer, Ganesh Ramakrishnan	None	None	Automatic video summarization has attracted a lot of interest. However it is still an unsolved problem due to several challenges. We take steps towards making automatic video summarization more realistic by addressing the following challenges. The currently available datasets either have very short videos or have few long videos of only a particular type. We introduce a new benchmarking video dataset called VISIOCITY (VIdeo SummarIzatiOn based on Continuity, Intent and DiversiTY) which comprises of longer videos across six different categories with dense concept annotations capable of supporting different flavors of video summarization and other vision problems. Secondly, for long videos, human reference summaries necessary for supervised video summarization techniques are difficult to obtain. We explore strategies to automatically generate multiple reference summaries from indirect ground truth present in VISIOCITY. We show that these summaries are at par with human summaries. We also present a study of different desired characteristics of a good summary and demonstrate how, especially in long videos, it is quite possible and frequent to have two good summaries with different characteristics. Thus we argue that evaluating a summary against one or more human summaries and using a single measure has its shortcomings. We propose an evaluation framework for better quantitative assessment of summary quality which is closer to human judgment. Lastly, we present insights into how a model can be enhanced to yield better summaries. Sepcifically, when multiple diverse ground truth summaries can exist, learning from them individually and using a combination of loss functions measuring different characteristics is better than learning from a single combined (oracle) ground truth summary using a single loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of doing so as compared to some of the representative state of the art techniques tested on VISIOCITY. We release VISIOCITY as a benchmarking dataset and invite researchers to test the effectiveness of their video summarization algorithms on VISIOCITY.

 Superconducting coherence lengths of hole-doped cuprates obtained from electron-boson spectral density functions	Jungseek Hwang	Electronic address: jungseek@skku.edu	None	Electron‚Äìboson spectral density functions (EBSDFs) can be obtained from measured spectra using various spectroscopic techniques, including optical spectroscopy. EBSDFs, known as glue functions, have a magnetic origin. Here, we investigated EBSDFs obtained from the measured optical spectra of hole-doped cuprates with wide doping levels, from underdoped to overdoped cuprates. The average frequency of an EBSDF provides the timescale for the spin fluctuations to form Cooper pairs. This timescale is directly associated with retarded interactions between electrons. Using this timescale and Fermi velocity, a reasonable superconducting coherence length, which reflects the size of the Cooper pair, can be extracted. The obtained coherence lengths were consistent with those measured via other experimental techniques. Therefore, the formation of Cooper pairs in cuprates can be explained by spin fluctuations, the timescales of which appear in EBSDFs. Consequently, EBSDFs provide crucial information on the timescale of the microscopic mechanism of Cooper pair formation.

 Autonomous Vehicle-to-Grid Design for Provision of Frequency Control Ancillary Service and Distribution Voltage RegulationThis work was supported in part by Japan Science and Technology Agency, Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (JST-CREST) Program #JP-MJCR15K3. (Corresponding author: Yoshihiko Susuki, susuki@ieee.org)	ShotaYumiki,YoshihikoSusuki,Yuta Oshikubo,YutakaOta,RyoMasegi,AkihikoKawashima,AtsushiIshigame,ShinkichiInagaki, andTatsuyaSuzuki	None	None	We develop a system-level design for the provision of Ancillary Service (AS) for control of electric power grids by in-vehicle batteries, suitably applied to Electric Vehicles (EVs) operated in a sharing service. An architecture for cooperation between transportation and energy management systems is introduced that enables us to design an autonomous Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) for the provision of multi-objective AS: primary frequency control in a transmission grid and voltage amplitude regulation in a distribution grid connected to EVs. The design is based on the ordinary differential equation model of distribution voltage, which has been recently introduced as a new physics-based model, and is utilized in this paper for assessing and regulating the impact of spatiotemporal charging/charging of a large population of EVs to a distribution grid. Effectiveness of the autonomous V2G design is evaluated with numerical simulations of realistic models for transmission and distribution grids with synthetic operation data on EVs in a sharing service. In addition, we present a hardware-in-the-loop test for evaluating its feasibility in a situation where inevitable latency is involved due to power, control, and communication equipments.

We observe strong anisotropic electronic properties and an optical gap in the leg direction that is gradually filled above the antiferromagnetic (afm) ordering temperature, turning the systems into a metallic phase. Combining the optical data with the DFT calculations we associate the optical gap feature with the p ùëù p italic_p - d ùëë d italic_d transition that appears only in the afm ordered state. Hence, the insulating ground state along the leg direction is attributed to Slater physics rather than Mott-type correlations.	
 Lack of simple correlation between switching current density and spin-orbit torque efficiency of perpendicularly magnetized spin-current generator/ferromagnet heterostructures			None		
 PFirewall: Semantics-Aware Customizable Data Flow Control for Smart Home Privacy Protection	, , , 	None	None	Internet of Things (IoT) platforms enable users to deploy home automation applications. Meanwhile, privacy issues arise as large amounts of sensitive device data flow out to IoT platforms. Most of the data flowing to a platform actually do not trigger automation actions, while homeowners currently have no control once devices are bound to the platform. We present PFirewall , a customizable data-flow control system to enhance the privacy of IoT platform users. PFirewall automatically generates data-minimization policies, which only disclose minimum amount of data to fulfill automation. In addition, PFirewall provides interfaces for homeowners to customize individual privacy preferences by defining user-specified policies. To enforce these policies, PFirewall transparently intervenes and mediates the communication between IoT devices and the platform, without modifying the platform, IoT devices, or hub. Evaluation results on four real-world testbeds show that PFirewall reduces IoT data sent to the platform by 97% without impairing home automation, and effectively mitigates user-activity inference/tracking attacks and other privacy risks.

 El Volumen Louder Por Favor: Code-switching in Task-oriented Semantic Parsing	Arash Einolghozati Abhinav Arora Lorena SainzMaza LecandaFacebook	None	None	Being able to parse code-switched (CS) utterances, such as Spanish+English or Hindi+English, is essential to democratize task-oriented semantic parsing systems for certain locales. In this work, we focus on Spanglish (Spanish+English) and release a dataset, CSTOP, containing 5800 CS utterances alongside their semantic parses. We examine the CS generalizability of various Cross-lingual (XL) models and exhibit the advantage of pre-trained XL language models when data for only one language is present. As such, we focus on improving the pre-trained models for the case when only English corpus alongside either zero or a few CS training instances are available. We propose two data augmentation methods for the zero-shot and the few-shot settings: fine-tune using translate-and-align and augment using a generation model followed by match-and-filter. Combining the few-shot setting with the above improvements decreases the initial 30 30 30 30 -point accuracy gap between the zero-shot and the full-data settings by two thirds.

 Principal frequency of an ultrashort laser pulse	Enrique Neyra, Pablo Vaveliuk, Emilio Pisanty, Andrew Maxwell, Maciej Lewenstein, Marcelo Ciappina	None	None	We introduce an alternative definition of the main frequency of an ultrashort laser pulse, the principal frequency œâ P subscript ùúî ùëÉ \omega_{P} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . This parameter is complementary to the most accepted and widely used carrier frequency œâ 0 subscript ùúî 0 \omega_{0} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . Given the fact that these ultrashort pulses, also known as transients, have a temporal width comprising only few cycles of the carrier wave, corresponding to a spectral bandwidth Œî œâ Œî ùúî \Delta\omega roman_Œî italic_œâ covering several octaves, œâ P subscript ùúî ùëÉ \omega_{P} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT describes, in a more precise way, the dynamics driven by these sources. We present examples where, for instance, œâ P subscript ùúî ùëÉ \omega_{P} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is able to correctly predict the high-order harmonic cutoff independently of the carrier envelope phase. This is confirmed by solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation in reduced dimensions, supplemented with the time-analysis of the quantum spectra, where it is possible to observe how the sub-cycle electron dynamics is better described using œâ P subscript ùúî ùëÉ \omega_{P} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_P end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .

Although many highly accurate methods based on signal fingerprints have been lately proposed for localization, their vast majority faces the problem of degrading performance when deployed in indoor systems, where the propagation environment changes rapidly. In order to address this issue, the crowdsourcing approach has been adopted, according to which the fingerprints are frequently updated in the respective database via user reporting. However, the late crowdsourcing techniques require precise indoor floor plans and fail to provide satisfactory accuracy. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity self-calibrating indoor crowdsourcing localization system that combines historical with frequently updated fingerprints for high precision user positioning. We present a multi-kernel transfer learning approach which exploits the inner relationship between the original and updated channel measurements. Our indoor laboratory experimental results with the proposed approach and using Nexus 5 smartphones at 2.4GHz with 20MHz bandwidth have shown the feasibility of about one meter level accuracy with a reasonable fingerprint update overhead.	
 Artificial neural network approach for turbulence models: A local framework	Chenyue XiestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Xiangming XiongstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jianchun WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	Corresponding author. Email: chenyuex@princeton.edu	None	A local artificial neural network (LANN) framework is developed for turbulence modeling. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) unclosed terms are reconstructed by artificial neural network (ANN) based on the local coordinate system which is orthogonal to the curved walls. We verify the proposed model for the flows over periodic hills. The correlation coefficients of the RANS unclosed terms predicted by the LANN model can be made larger than 0.96 in an a priori analysis, and the relative error of the unclosed terms can be made smaller than 18 % percent \% % . In an a posteriori analysis, detailed comparisons are made on the results of RANS simulations using the LANN and Spalart-Allmaras (SA) models. It is shown that the LANN model performs better than the SA model in the prediction of the average velocity, wall-shear stress and average pressure, which gives the results that are essentially indistinguishable from the direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The LANN model trained in low Reynolds number R e = 2800 ùëÖ ùëí 2800 Re=2800 italic_R italic_e = 2800 can be directly applied in the cases of high Reynolds numbers R e = 5600 ùëÖ ùëí 5600 Re=5600 italic_R italic_e = 5600 , 10595, 19000, 37000 with accurate predictions. Furthermore, the LANN model is verified for flows over periodic hills with varying slopes. These results suggest that the LANN framework has a great potential to be applied to complex turbulent flows with curved walls.

 Ocean Circulation on Enceladus With a High Versus Low Salinity Ocean	Yaoxuan Zeng, Malte Jansen	None	None	Previous studies that have considered the ocean circulation on Enceladus have generally assumed the salinity to be Earth-like. However, according to observations and geochemical constraints, the salinity of Enceladus‚Äô ocean is likely to be lower, and importantly, it is probably low enough to reverse the sign of thermal expansivity. We investigate the ocean circulation and stratification of Enceladus‚Äô ocean using a combination of theoretical arguments and simulations using the MITgcm. We find that, if the salinity is high, the whole ocean is unstratified, and convection dominates the entire ocean. However, if the salinity is low enough, there exists a stratified layer in the upper ocean, whose thickness depends on the magnitude of the turbulent vertical diffusivity, which remains poorly constrained. Such a layer can suppress the vertical flux of heat and tracers, thereby affecting the heat flux to the ice shell and leading to a vertical tracer mixing time scale across the stratified layer of at least hundreds of years. This time scale is inconsistent with a previous estimate of vertical ocean mixing of several years, based on the size of detected silica nanoparticles in the plumes, leading us to conclude that either the salinity of Enceladus‚Äô ocean is higher than previously suggested or the interpretation of silica nanoparticle observations has to be reconsidered.	
 Deep Learning for Scene Classification: A Survey	DeluZeng,MinyuLiao,MohammadTavakolian,YulanGuoBoleiZhou, Dewen Hu,Matti Pietikinen, andLi Liu	None	None	Scene classification, aiming at classifying a scene image to one of the predefined scene categories by comprehending the entire image, is a longstanding, fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision. The rise of large-scale datasets, which constitute the corresponding dense sampling of diverse real-world scenes, and the renaissance of deep learning techniques, which learn powerful feature representations directly from big raw data, have been bringing remarkable progress in the field of scene representation and classification. To help researchers master needed advances in this field, the goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of recent achievements in scene classification using deep learning. More than 200 major publications are included in this survey covering different aspects of scene classification, including challenges, benchmark datasets, taxonomy, and quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, this paper is also concluded with a list of promising research opportunities.	
 Hyperspectral Image Classification: Artifacts of Dimension Reduction on Hybrid CNN	Muhammad Ahmad, Sidrah Shabbir, Rana Aamir Raza, Manuel Mazzara, Salvatore Distefano, Adil Mehmood Khan	None	None	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been extensively studied for Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC) more specifically, 2D and 3D CNN models have proved highly efficient in exploiting the spatial and spectral information of Hyperspectral Images. However, 2D CNN only considers the spatial information and ignores the spectral information whereas 3D CNN jointly exploits spatial-spectral information at a high computational cost. Therefore, this work proposed a lightweight CNN (3D followed by 2D-CNN) model which significantly reduces the computational cost by distributing spatial-spectral feature extraction across a lighter model alongside a preprocessing that has been carried out to improve the classification results. Five benchmark Hyperspectral datasets (i.e., SalinasA, Salinas, Indian Pines, Pavia University, Pavia Center, and Botswana) are used for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the proposed pipeline outperformed in terms of generalization performance, statistical significance, and computational complexity, as compared to the state-of-the-art 2D/3D CNN models except commonly used computationally expensive design choices.	
 Numerical aspects of shot noise representation of infinitely divisible laws and related processesThe authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for their valuable feedback that helped improve the quality of this manuscript.		None	None	The ever-growing appearance of infinitely divisible laws and related processes in various areas, such as physics, mathematical biology, finance and economics, has fuelled an increasing demand for numerical methods of sampling and sample path generation. In this survey, we review shot noise representation with a view towards sampling infinitely divisible laws and generating sample paths of related processes. In contrast to many conventional methods, the shot noise approach remains practical even in the multidimensional setting. We provide a brief introduction to shot noise representations of infinitely divisible laws and related processes, and discuss the truncation of such series representations towards the simulation of infinitely divisible random vectors, L√©vy processes, infinitely divisible processes and fields and L√©vy-driven stochastic differential equations. Essential notions and results towards practical implementation are outlined, and summaries of simulation recipes are provided throughout along with numerical illustrations. Some future research directions are highlighted.

Here we propose and pursue an experimental strategy that, while focusing on various HCIs of a single atomic element, keeps the number of candidate clock transitions as large as possible. Following this strategy, we identify four adjacent charge states of nickel HCIs that offer as many as six optical transitions. Experimentally, we demonstrated the essential capability of producing these ions in the low-energy compact Shanghai-Wuhan Electron Beam Ion Trap. We measured the wavelengths of four magnetic-dipole ( M ùëÄ M italic_M 1) and one electric-quadrupole ( E ùê∏ E italic_E 2) clock transitions with an accuracy of several ppm with a novel calibration method; two of these lines were observed and characterized for the first time in controlled laboratory settings. Compared to the earlier determinations, our measurements improved wavelength accuracy by an order of magnitude. Such measurements are crucial for constraining the range of laser wavelengths for finding the ‚Äúneedle in a haystack‚Äù narrow lines. In addition, we calculated frequencies and quality factors, evaluated sensitivity of these six transitions to the hypothetical variation of the electromagnetic fine structure constant Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± needed for fundamental physics applications. We argue that all the six transitions in nickel HCIs offer intrinsic immunity to all common perturbations of quantum oscillators, and one of them has the projected fractional frequency uncertainty down to the remarkable level of 10 ‚àí 19 19 {}^{-19} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 19 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT .

Most previous work in Arabic has been based on regular methods of machine learning that mainly depends on a group of rare resources and tools for analyzing and processing Arabic content such as lexicons, but the lack of those resources presents another challenge. In order to address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL)-based methods are proposed using two models based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for ABSA. The first is a DL model that takes advantage of word and character representations by combining bidirectional GRU, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) making up the (BGRU-CNN-CRF) model to extract the main opinionated aspects (OTE). The second is an interactive attention network based on bidirectional GRU (IAN-BGRU) to identify sentiment polarity toward extracted aspects. We evaluated our models using the benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset proposed by (Pontiki et al.,, 2016 ) . The results indicate that the proposed methods are better than baseline research on both tasks having 39.7% enhancement in F1-score for opinion target extraction (T2) and 7.58% in accuracy for aspect-based sentiment polarity classification (T3). Achieving F1 score of 70.67% for T2, and accuracy of 83.98% for T3.

 1 Monopole in Berry‚Äôs phase			None	Berry‚Äôs phase, which is associated with the slow cyclic motion with a finite period, looks like a Dirac monopole when seen from far away but smoothly changes to a dipole near the level crossing point in the parameter space in an exactly solvable model. This topology change of Berry‚Äôs phase is visualized as a result of lensing effect; the monopole supposed to be located at the level crossing point appears at the displaced point when the variables of the model deviate from the precisely adiabatic movement. The effective magnetic field generated by Berry‚Äôs phase is determined by a simple geometrical consideration of the magnetic flux coming from the displaced Dirac monopole.	
 Iterative Weak Learnability and Multi-Class AdaBoost	InKoo Cho, Jonathan Libgober	icho30@emory.edu	Department of Economics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA	We construct an efficient recursive ensemble algorithm for the multi-class classification problem, inspired by SAMME ( \citeasnoun ZhuZouRossetandHastie09). We strengthen the weak learnability condition in \citeasnoun ZhuZouRossetandHastie09 by requiring that the weak learnability condition holds for any subset of labels with at least two elements. This condition is simpler to check than many proposed alternatives (e.g., \citeasnoun MukherjeeSchapire2013). As SAMME, our algorithm is reduced to the Adaptive Boosting algorithm ( \citeasnoun SchapireandFreund12) if the number of labels is two, and can be motivated as a functional version of the steepest descending method to find an optimal solution. In contrast to SAMME, our algorithm‚Äôs final hypothesis converges to the correct label with probability 1. For any number of labels, the probability of misclassification vanishes exponentially as the training period increases. The sum of the training error and an additional term, that depends only on the sample size, bounds the generalization error of our algorithm as the Adaptive Boosting algorithm. Keywords.

However, previous research has failed to account for the resisting strategies employed by an individual to foil such persuasion attempts. Grounded in prior literature in cognitive and social psychology, we propose a generalised framework for identifying resisting strategies in persuasive conversations. We instantiate our framework on two distinct datasets comprising persuasion and negotiation conversations. We also leverage a hierarchical sequence-labelling neural architecture to infer the aforementioned resisting strategies automatically. Our experiments reveal the asymmetry of power roles in non-collaborative goal-directed conversations and the benefits accrued from incorporating resisting strategies on the final conversation outcome. We also investigate the role of different resisting strategies on the conversation outcome and glean insights that corroborate with past findings. We also make the code and the dataset of this work publicly available at https://github.com/americast/resper .	
 Comparison of Minimization Methods for Rosenbrock Functions	Iyanuoluwa Emiola, Robson Adem	None	None	This paper gives an in-depth review of the most common iterative methods for unconstrained optimization using two functions that belong to a class of Rosenbrock functions as a performance test. This study covers the Steepest Gradient Descent Method, the Newton-Raphson Method, and the Fletcher-Reeves Conjugate Gradient method. In addition, four different step-size selecting methods including fixed-step-size, variable step-size, quadratic-fit, and golden section method were considered. Due to the computational nature of solving minimization problems, testing the algorithms is an essential part of this paper. Therefore, an extensive set of numerical test results is also provided to present an insightful and a comprehensive comparison of the reviewed algorithms. This study highlights the differences and the trade-offs involved in comparing these algorithms.

The laser peak intensity and wavelength are varied to find suitable parameters for high-harmonic imaging in the water window. Comparison of the SAE and RMT results shows qualitative agreement between them as well as parameters such as the cutoff frequency predicted by the classical three-step model. However, there are significant differences in the details, particularly in the predicted conversion efficiency. These details indicate the possible importance of multi-electron effects, as well as a strong sensitivity of quantitative predictions on specific aspects of the numerical model.

 Robust and Secure Sum-Rate Maximization for Multiuser MISO Downlink Systems with Self-sustainable IRS	Shaokang Hu, ShaokangHu,ZhiqiangWei,YuanxinCai,ChangLiu,DerrickWingKwan Ng,andJinhongYuan	None	None	This paper investigates robust and secure multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communications assisted by a self-sustainable intelligent reflection surface (IRS), which can simultaneously reflect and harvest energy from the received signals. We study the joint design of beamformers at an access point (AP) and the phase shifts as well as the energy harvesting schedule at the IRS for maximizing the system sum-rate. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem taking into account the wireless energy harvesting capability of IRS elements, secure communications, and the robustness against the impact of channel state information (CSI) imperfection. Subsequently, we propose a computationally-efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to the design problem. In each iteration, ùíÆ ùíÆ \mathcal{S} caligraphic_S -procedure and the successive convex approximation are adopted to handle the intermediate optimization problem. Our simulation results unveil that: 1) there is a non-trivial trade-off between the system sum-rate and the self-sustainability of the IRS; 2) the performance gain achieved by the proposed scheme is saturated with a large number of energy harvesting IRS elements; 3) an IRS equipped with small bit-resolution discrete phase shifters is sufficient to achieve a considerable system sum-rate of the ideal case with continuous phase shifts.	
 ALMA observation of the protoplanetary disk around WW Cha: faint double-peaked ring and asymmetric structure	Kazuhiro Kanagawa, Jun Hashimoto, Takayuki Muto, Takashi Tsukagoshi, Sanemichi Takahashi, Yasuhiro Hasegawa, Mihoko Konishi, Hideko Nomura, Hauyu Baobab Liu, Ruobing Dong, Akimasa Kataoka, Munetake Momose, Tomohiro Ono, Michael Sitko, Michihiro Takami, Kengo Tomida	None	None	We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 observations of dust continuum emission of the disk around WW Cha. The dust continuum image shows a smooth disk structure with a faint (low-contrast) dust ring, extending from ‚àº 40 similar-to absent 40 \sim 40 ‚àº 40 au to ‚àº 70 similar-to absent 70 \sim 70 ‚àº 70 au, not accompanied by any gap. We constructed the simple model to fit the visibility of the observed data by using MCMC method and found that the bump (we call the ring without the gap the bump) has two peaks at 40 au and 70 au. The residual map between the model and observation indicates asymmetric structures at the center and the outer region of the disk. These asymmetric structures are also confirmed by model-independent analysis of the imaginary part of the visibility. The asymmetric structure at the outer region is consistent with a spiral observed by SPHERE. To constrain physical quantities of the disk (dust density and temperature), we carried out radiative transfer simulations. We found that the midplane temperature around the outer peak is close to the freezeout temperature of CO on water ice ( ‚àº 30 similar-to absent 30 \sim 30 ‚àº 30 K). The temperature around the inner peak is about 50 50 50 50 K, which is close to the freezeout temperature of H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT S and also close to the sintering temperature of several species.

 A Unified Paths Perspective for Pruning at Initialization	Thomas GebhartDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of MinnesotaUdit SaxenastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSumo LogicPaul SchraterDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of Minnesota	None	None	A number of recent approaches have been proposed for pruning neural network parameters at initialization with the goal of reducing the size and computational burden of models while minimally affecting their training dynamics and generalization performance. While each of these approaches have some amount of well-founded motivation, a rigorous analysis of the effect of these pruning methods on network training dynamics and their formal relationship to each other has thus far received little attention. Leveraging recent theoretical approximations provided by the Neural Tangent Kernel, we unify a number of popular approaches for pruning at initialization under a single path-centric framework. We introduce the Path Kernel as the data-independent factor in a decomposition of the Neural Tangent Kernel and show the global structure of the Path Kernel can be computed efficiently. This Path Kernel decomposition separates the architectural effects from the data-dependent effects within the Neural Tangent Kernel, providing a means to predict the convergence dynamics of a network from its architecture alone. We analyze the use of this structure in approximating training and generalization performance of networks in the absence of data across a number of initialization pruning approaches. Observing the relationship between input data and paths and the relationship between the Path Kernel and its natural norm, we additionally propose two augmentations of the SynFlow algorithm for pruning at initialization.	
 A General Framework Combining Generative Adversarial Networks and Mixture Density Networks for Inverse Modeling in Microstructural Materials Design	Zijiang Yang, Dipendra Jha, Arindam Paul, Weikeng Liao, Alok Choudhary, Ankit AgrawalDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringNorthwestern University	None	None	Microstructural materials design is one of the most important applications of inverse modeling in materials science. Generally speaking, there are two broad modeling paradigms in scientific applications: forward and inverse. While the forward modeling estimates the observations based on known parameters, the inverse modeling attempts to infer the parameters given the observations. Inverse problems are usually more critical as well as difficult in scientific applications as they seek to explore the parameters that cannot be directly observed. Inverse problems are used extensively in various scientific fields, such as geophysics, healthcare and materials science. However, it is challenging to solve inverse problems, because they usually need to learn a one-to-many non-linear mapping, and also require significant computing time, especially for high-dimensional parameter space. Further, inverse problems become even more difficult to solve when the dimension of input (i.e. observation) is much lower than that of output (i.e. parameters). In this work, we propose a framework consisting of generative adversarial networks and mixture density networks for inverse modeling, and it is evaluated on a materials science dataset for microstructural materials design. Compared with baseline methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework can overcome the above-mentioned challenges and produce multiple promising solutions in an efficient manner.	
 1 Introduction			None	Biomedical research is intensive in processing information in the previously published papers. This motivated a lot of efforts to provide tools for text mining and information extraction from PDF documents over the past decade. The *nix (Unix/Linux) operating systems offer many tools for working with text files, however, very few such tools are available for processing the contents of PDF files. This paper reports our effort to develop shell script utilities for *nix systems with the core functionality focused on viewing and searching multiple PDF documents combining logical and regular expressions, and enabling more reliable text extraction from PDF documents with subsequent manipulation of the resulting blocks of text. Furthermore, a procedure for extracting the most frequently occurring multi-word phrases was devised and then demonstrated on several scientific papers in life sciences. Our experiments revealed that the procedure is surprisingly robust to deficiencies in text extraction and the actual scoring function used to rank the phrases in terms of their importance or relevance. The keyword relevance is strongly context dependent, the word stemming did not provide any recognizable advantage, and the stop-words should only be removed from the beginning and the end of phrases. In addition, the developed utilities were used to convert the list of acronyms and the index from a PDF e-book into a large list of biochemical terms which can be exploited in other text mining tasks. All shell scripts and data files are available in a public repository named pdf P apers on the Github. The key lesson learned in this work is that semi-automated methods combining the power of algorithms with the capabilities of research experience are the most promising for improving the research efficiency.

Several numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the validity and robustness of the proposed method.

 Investigating the significance of adversarial attacks and their relation to interpretability for radar-based human activity recognition systems	Utku Ozbulak,,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTBaptist Vandersmissen,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTAzarakhsh Jalalvand,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTIvo CouckuytstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTArnout Van Messem,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTWesley De Neve,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Given their substantial success in addressing a wide range of computer vision challenges, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used in smart home applications, with many of these applications relying on the automatic recognition of human activities. In this context, low-power radar devices have recently gained in popularity as recording sensors, given that the usage of these devices allows mitigating a number of privacy concerns, a key issue when making use of conventional video cameras. Another concern that is often cited when designing smart home applications is the resilience of these applications against cyberattacks. It is, for instance, well-known that the combination of images and CNNs is vulnerable against adversarial examples, mischievous data points that force machine learning models to generate wrong classifications during testing time. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of radar-based CNNs to adversarial attacks, and where these radar-based CNNs have been designed to recognize human gestures. Through experiments with four unique threat models, we show that radar-based CNNs are susceptible to both white- and black-box adversarial attacks. We also expose the existence of an extreme adversarial attack case, where it is possible to change the prediction made by the radar-based CNNs by only perturbing the padding of the inputs, without touching the frames where the action itself occurs. Moreover, we observe that gradient-based attacks exercise perturbation not randomly, but on important features of the input data. We highlight these important features by making use of Grad-CAM, a popular neural network interpretability method, hereby showing the connection between adversarial perturbation and prediction interpretability.

 Coloring the Black Box: What Synesthesia Tells Us about Character Embeddings	Katharina KannUniversity of Colorado BoulderMauro MonsalveMercadoColumbia University	None	None	In contrast to their word- or sentence-level counterparts, character embeddings are still poorly understood. We aim at closing this gap with an in-depth study of English character embeddings. For this, we use resources from research on grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthesia ‚Äì a neuropsychological phenomenon where letters are associated with colors ‚Äì, which give us insight into which characters are similar for synesthetes and how characters are organized in color space. Comparing 10 different character embeddings, we ask: How similar are character embeddings to a synesthete‚Äôs perception of characters? And how similar are character embeddings extracted from different models? We find that LSTMs agree with humans more than transformers. Comparing across tasks, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion results in the most human-like character embeddings. Finally, ELMo embeddings differ from both humans and other models.

For a wider range of coupling constants, we construct numerical solutions, which possess the same type of asymptotic decay as the exact analytical solution, both decaying into a spin nematic state.

 Differential Privacy for Industrial Internet of Things: Opportunities, Applications and Challenges	Bin Jiang,,Jianqiang Li,Guanghui Yue,and Houbing Song	None	None	The development of Internet of Things (IoT) brings new changes to various fields. Particularly, industrial IoT (IIoT) is promoting a new round of industrial revolution. With more applications of IIoT, privacy protection issues are emerging. Especially, some common algorithms in IIoT technology, such as deep models, strongly rely on data collection, which leads to the risk of privacy disclosure. Recently, differential privacy has been used to protect user-terminal privacy in IIoT, so it is necessary to make in-depth research on this topic. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the opportunities, applications, and challenges of differential privacy in IIoT. We first review related papers on IIoT and privacy protection, respectively. Then, we focus on the metrics of industrial data privacy, and analyze the contradiction between data utilization for deep models and individual privacy protection. Several valuable problems are summarized and new research ideas are put forward. In conclusion, this survey is dedicated to complete comprehensive summary and lay foundation for the follow-up research on industrial differential privacy.	
 Towards a Secure and Resilient All-Renewable Energy Grid for Smart Cities	CharalambosKonstantinou	None	None	The concept of smart cities is driven by the need to enhance citizens‚Äô quality of life. It is estimated that 70% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050. The electric grid is the energy backbone of smart city deployments. An electric energy system immune to adverse events, both cyber and physical risks, and able to support the integration of renewable sources will drive a transformational development approach for future smart cities. This article describes how the future electric energy system with 100% electricity supply from renewable energy sources requires the ‚Äúbirth of security and resiliency‚Äù incorporated with its ecosystem.	
 Nodeless superconductivity in Lu_{5-ùë•}Rh‚ÇÜSn_{18+ùë•} with broken time reversal symmetry	Wang, Nie, Du, Pang, Kase, Akimitsu, Chen, Gutmann, Adroja, Perry, Cao, Smidman, Yuan	None	None	Evidence for broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) has been found in the superconducting states of the R 5 subscript ùëÖ 5 R_{5} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT Rh 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Sn 18 18 {}_{18} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 18 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT (R = Sc, Y, Lu) compounds with a centrosymmetric caged crystal structure, but the origin of this phenomenon is unresolved.

 Transparent Contribution Evaluation for Secure Federated Learning on Blockchain	Shuaicheng Ma, Yang Cao, Li Xiong	None	None	Federated Learning is a promising machine learning paradigm when multiple parties collaborate to build a high-quality machine learning model. Nonetheless, these parties are only willing to participate when given enough incentives, such as a fair reward based on their contributions. Many studies explored Shapley value based methods to evaluate each party‚Äôs contribution to the learned model. However, they commonly assume a semi-trusted server to train the model and evaluate the data owners‚Äô model contributions, which lacks transparency and may hinder the success of federated learning in practice. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework and a protocol to transparently evaluate each participant‚Äôs contribution. Our framework protects all parties‚Äô privacy in the model building phase and transparently evaluates contributions based on the model updates. The experiment with the handwritten digits dataset demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the contributions.	
 Representations for Question Answering from Documents with Tables and Text	Vicky ZayatsdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTKristina ToutanovadaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMari OstendorflxsectionsignstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTGoogle ResearchlxsectionsignstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversity of Washington	None	None	Tables in Web documents are pervasive and can be directly used to answer many of the queries searched on the Web, motivating their integration in question answering. Very often information presented in tables is succinct and hard to interpret with standard language representations. On the other hand, tables often appear within textual context, such as an article describing the table. Using the information from an article as additional context can potentially enrich table representations. In this work we aim to improve question answering from tables by refining table representations based on information from surrounding text. We also present an effective method to combine text and table-based predictions for question answering from full documents, obtaining significant improvements on the Natural Questions dataset.

 1 Introduction			None	We consider an initial-boundary value problem for the n ùëõ n italic_n -dimensional wave equation with the variable sound speed, n ‚©æ 1 ùëõ 1 n\geqslant 1 italic_n ‚©æ 1 . We construct three-level implicit in time and compact in space (three-point in each space direction) 4th order finite-difference schemes on the uniform rectangular meshes including their one-parameter (for n = 2 ùëõ 2 n=2 italic_n = 2 ) and three-parameter (for n = 3 ùëõ 3 n=3 italic_n = 3 ) families. We also show that some already known methods can be converted into such schemes. In a unified manner, we prove the conditional stability of schemes in the strong and weak energy norms together with the 4th order error estimate under natural conditions on the time step. We also transform an unconditionally stable 4th order two-level scheme suggested for n = 2 ùëõ 2 n=2 italic_n = 2 to the three-level form, extend it for any n ‚©æ 1 ùëõ 1 n\geqslant 1 italic_n ‚©æ 1 and prove its stability. We also give an example of a compact scheme for non-uniform in space and time rectangular meshes. We suggest simple fast iterative methods based on FFT to implement the schemes. A new effective initial guess to start iterations is given too. We also present promising results of numerical experiments.	
 Light and Airy: a simple solution for relativistic quantum acceleration radiation	Michael RR Good,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Eric VLinder,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We study the quantum radiation of particle production by vacuum from an ultra-relativistic moving mirror (dynamical Casimir effect) solution that allows (possibly for the first time) analytically calculable time evolution of particle creation and an Airy particle spectral distribution. The reality of the beta Bogoliubov coefficients is responsible for the simplicity, and the mirror is asymptotically inertial at the speed of light, with finite energy production. We also discuss general relations regarding negative energy flux, the transformation to the 1-D Schr√∂dinger equation, and the incompleteness of entanglement entropy.	
 Equilibrium shapes and floatability of static and vertically vibrated heavy liquid drops on the surface of a lighter fluid	Andrey Pototsky, Alexander Oron, Michael Bestehorn	apototskyy@swin.edu.au	None	A small drop of a heavier fluid may float on the surface of a lighter fluid supported by surface tension forces. In equilibrium, the drop assumes a radially symmetric shape with a circular triple-phase contact line. We show theoretically and experimentally that such a floating liquid drop with a sufficiently small volume has two distinct stable equilibrium shapes: one with a larger and one with a smaller radius of the triple-phase contact line. Next, we experimentally study the floatability of a less viscous water drop on the surface of a more viscous and less dense oil, subjected to a low frequency (Hz-order) vertical vibration. We find that in a certain range of amplitudes, vibration helps heavy liquid drops to stay afloat. The physical mechanism of the increased floatability is explained by the horizontal elongation of the drop driven by subharmonic Faraday waves. The average length of the triple-phase contact line increases as the drop elongates that leads to a larger average lifting force produced by the surface tension.

 Generating Syntactically Controlled Paraphrases without Using Annotated Parallel Pairs	KuanHao HuangUniversity of California, Los AngelesKaiWei ChangUniversity of California, Los Angeles	None	None	Paraphrase generation plays an essential role in natural language process (NLP), and it has many downstream applications. However, training supervised paraphrase models requires many annotated paraphrase pairs, which are usually costly to obtain. On the other hand, the paraphrases generated by existing unsupervised approaches are usually syntactically similar to the source sentences and are limited in diversity. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate syntactically various paraphrases without the need for annotated paraphrase pairs. We propose Syntactically controlled Paraphrase Generator (SynPG), an encoder-decoder based model that learns to disentangle the semantics and the syntax of a sentence from a collection of unannotated texts. The disentanglement enables SynPG to control the syntax of output paraphrases by manipulating the embedding in the syntactic space. Extensive experiments using automatic metrics and human evaluation show that SynPG performs better syntactic control than unsupervised baselines, while the quality of the generated paraphrases is competitive. We also demonstrate that the performance of SynPG is competitive or even better than supervised models when the unannotated data is large. Finally, we show that the syntactically controlled paraphrases generated by SynPG can be utilized for data augmentation to improve the robustness of NLP models.	
 Toward Personalized Affect-Aware Socially Assistive Robot Tutors in Long-Term Interventions for Children with Autism	Zhonghao Shi, Thomas Groechel, Shomik Jain, Kourtney Chima, Ognjen Oggi Rudovic, Maja Matari	zhonghas@usc.edu	None	Affect-aware socially assistive robotics (SAR) has shown great potential for augmenting interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, current SAR cannot yet perceive the unique and diverse set of atypical cognitive-affective behaviors from children with ASD in an automatic and personalized fashion in long-term (multi-session) real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, this work designed and validated personalized models of arousal and valence for children with ASD using a multi-session in-home dataset of SAR interventions. By training machine learning (ML) algorithms with supervised domain adaptation (s-DA), the personalized models were able to trade off between the limited individual data and the more abundant less personal data pooled from other study participants. We evaluated the effects of personalization on a long-term multimodal dataset consisting of 4 children with ASD with a total of 19 sessions, and derived inter-rater reliability (IR) scores for binary arousal (IR = 83%) and valence (IR = 81%) labels between human annotators. Our results show that personalized Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost) models with s-DA outperformed two non-personalized individualized and generic model baselines not only on the weighted average of all sessions, but also statistically ( p ùëù p italic_p ¬° .05) across individual sessions. This work paves the way for the development of personalized autonomous SAR systems tailored toward individuals with atypical cognitive-affective and socio-emotional needs.

One of them, GRB 190829A, was triggered by the Swift satellite, and about 2 √ó 10 4 2 superscript 10 4 2\times 10^{4} 2 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT s after the burst onset the VHE gamma-ray emission was detected by H.E.S.S. with ‚àº 5 œÉ similar-to absent 5 ùúé \sim 5\sigma ‚àº 5 italic_œÉ significance. This event had unusual features of having much smaller isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy than typical long GRBs and achromatic peaks in X-ray and optical afterglow at about 1.4 √ó 10 3 1.4 superscript 10 3 1.4\times 10^{3} 1.4 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT s. Here we propose an off-axis jet scenario that explains these observational results. In this model, the relativistic beaming effect is responsible for the apparently small isotropic gamma-ray energy and spectral peak energy. Using a jetted afterglow model, we find that the narrow jet, which has the initial Lorentz factor of 350 and the initial jet opening half-angle of 0.015 rad, viewed off-axis can describe the observed achromatic behavior in the X-ray and optical afterglow. Another wide, baryon-loaded jet is necessary for the later-epoch X-ray and radio emissions. According to our model, the VHE gamma rays observed by H.E.S.S. at 2 √ó 10 4 2 superscript 10 4 2\times 10^{4} 2 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT s may come from the narrow jet through the synchrotron self-Compton process.	
 Modeling the Allee effects induced by cost of predation fear and its carry-over effects	SouravKumarSasmal, YasuhiroTakeuchi	sourav.sasmal@gmail.com, sourav.kumar@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in	Department of Mathematics, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan 333-031, India	Predation driven Allee effects play an important role in the dynamics of small population, however, such predation-driven Allee effects cannot occur for the model with type I ùêº I italic_I functional response. It generally occurs when a generalist predator targets some specific prey. However, apart from the lethal effects of predation, there are some non-lethal effects in the presence of predator. Due to the fear of predation, positive density dependence growth may be observed at low population density, because of reduced foraging activities. Moreover, this non-lethal effect can be carried over generations. In the present manuscript, we investigate the role of predation fear and its carry-over effects in prey-predator model. First, we study the single species model in global perspective. We have shown that depending on the birth rate, our single species model describes three types of growth dynamics, namely, strong Allee dynamics, weak Allee dynamics and logistic dynamics. Then we consider the explicit dynamics of predator, with type I ùêº I italic_I functional response. Basic dynamical properties, as well as global stability of each equilibria have been discussed. From our analysis, we can observe that both the fear and its carry-over effects have significant role in the stability of the coexistence equilibrium, even if for the model with type I ùêº I italic_I functional response. The phenomenon ‚Äôparadox of enrichment‚Äô can be observed in our model, which cannot be observed in the classical prey-predator model with type I ùêº I italic_I functional response. However, we can see that such phenomenon can be ruled out by choosing suitable non-lethal effect parameters. Therefore, our study shows how non-lethal effects change the dynamics of a competition model, and has important biological insights, specially for the understanding of the dynamics of small populations.	
 1 Introduction			None	This article describes a new Monte Carlo method for the evaluation of the orthant probabilities by sampling first passage times of a non-singular Gaussian discrete time-series across an absorbing boundary. This procedure makes use of a simulation of several time-series sample paths, aiming to record their first crossing instants. Thus, the computation of the orthant probabilities is traced back to the accurate simulation of a non-singular Gaussian discrete-time series. Moreover, if the simulation is also efficient, this method is shown to be more speedy than the others proposed in the literature. As example, we make use of the Davies-Harte algorithm in the evaluation of the orthant probabilities associated to the ARFIMA ( 0 , d , 0 ) 0 ùëë 0 (0,d,0) ( 0 , italic_d , 0 ) model. Test results are presented that compare this method with currently available software.	
 ‚Äôt Hooft expansion of multi-boundary correlators in 2D topological gravity	Kazumi Okuyama, and Kazuhiro Sakai	None	None	We study multi-boundary correlators of Witten‚ÄìKontsevich topological gravity in two dimensions. We present a method of computing an open string like expansion, which we call the ‚Äôt Hooft expansion, of the n ùëõ n italic_n -boundary correlator for any n ùëõ n italic_n up to any order by directly solving the Korteweg‚ÄìDe Vries equation. We first explain how to compute the ‚Äôt Hooft expansion of the one-boundary correlator. The algorithm is very similar to that for the genus expansion of the open free energy. We next show that the ‚Äôt Hooft expansion of correlators with more than one boundary can be computed algebraically from the correlators with a lower number of boundaries. We explicitly compute the ‚Äôt Hooft expansion of the n ùëõ n italic_n -boundary correlators for n = 1 , 2 , 3 ùëõ 1 2 3 n=1,2,3 italic_n = 1 , 2 , 3 . Our results reproduce previously obtained results for Jackiw‚ÄìTeitelboim gravity and also the ‚Äôt Hooft expansion of the exact result of the three-boundary correlator which we calculate independently in the Airy case.	
 Using a Balanced Scorecard to Identify Opportunities to Improve Code Review Effectiveness: An Industrial Experience Report	Masum Hasan, Anindya Iqbal, Mohammad Rafid Ul Islam, AJM Imtiajur Rahman, Amiangshu Bosu	None	None	Peer code review is a widely adopted software engineering practice to ensure code quality and ensure software reliability in both the commercial and open-source software projects. Due to the large effort overhead associated with practicing code reviews, project managers often wonder, if their code reviews are effective and if there are improvement opportunities in that respect. Since project managers at Samsung Research Bangladesh (SRBD) were also intrigued by these questions, this research developed, deployed, and evaluated a production-ready solution using the Balanced SCorecard (BSC) strategy that SRBD managers can use in their day-to-day management to monitor individual developer‚Äôs, a particular project‚Äôs or the entire organization‚Äôs code review effectiveness. Following the four-step framework of the BSC strategy, we‚Äì 1) defined the operation goals of this research, 2) defined a set of metrics to measure the effectiveness of code reviews, 3) developed an automated mechanism to measure those metrics, and 4) developed and evaluated a monitoring application to inform the key stakeholders.	
 SkeletonVis: Interactive Visualization for Understanding Adversarial Attacks on Human Action Recognition Models	Haekyu Park,Zijie Wang,Nilaksh Das,Anindya Paul,Pruthvi Perumalla,Zhiyan Zhou,Duen Horng Chau	None	None	Skeleton-based human action recognition technologies are increasingly used in video based applications, such as home robotics, healthcare on aging population, and surveillance. However, such models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising serious concerns for their use in safety-critical applications. To develop an effective defense against attacks, it is essential to understand how such attacks mislead the pose detection models into making incorrect predictions. We present SkeletonVis , the first interactive system that visualizes how the attacks work on the models to enhance human understanding of attacks.	
 Low Resource Recognition and Linking of Biomedical Concepts from a Large Ontology	Sunil Mohan, Rico Angell, Nicholas Monath, Andrew McCallum	smohan@chanzuckerberg.com	None	Tools to explore scientific literature are essential for scientists, especially in biomedicine, where about a million new papers are published every year. Many such tools provide users the ability to search for specific entities (e.g. proteins, diseases) by tracking their mentions in papers. PubMed, the most well known database of biomedical papers, relies on human curators to add these annotations. This can take several weeks for new papers, and not all papers get tagged. Machine learning models have been developed to facilitate the semantic indexing of scientific papers. However their performance on the more comprehensive ontologies of biomedical concepts does not reach the levels of typical entity recognition problems studied in NLP. In large part this is due to their low resources, where the ontologies are large, there is a lack of descriptive text defining most entities, and labeled data can only cover a small portion of the ontology. In this paper, we develop a new model that overcomes these challenges by (1) generalizing to entities unseen at training time, and (2) incorporating linking predictions into the mention segmentation decisions. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for the UMLS ontology in both traditional recognition/linking (+8 F1 pts) as well as semantic indexing-based evaluation (+10 F1 pts).	
 Generalization error of random features and kernel methods: hypercontractivity and kernel matrix concentration	Song Mei, Theodor Misiakiewicz, Andrea Montanari	None	None	Consider the classical supervised learning problem: we are given data ( y i , ùíô i ) subscript ùë¶ ùëñ subscript ùíô ùëñ (y_{i},{\bm{x}}_{i}) ( italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , i ‚â§ n ùëñ ùëõ i\leq n italic_i ‚â§ italic_n , with y i subscript ùë¶ ùëñ y_{i} italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT a response and ùíô i ‚àà ùí≥ subscript ùíô ùëñ ùí≥ {\bm{x}}_{i}\in{\mathcal{X}} bold_italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà caligraphic_X a covariates vector, and try to learn a model f : ùí≥ ‚Üí ‚Ñù : ùëì ‚Üí ùí≥ ‚Ñù f:{\mathcal{X}}\to{\mathbb{R}} italic_f : caligraphic_X ‚Üí blackboard_R to predict future responses.

This can be viewed as a finite-dimensional approximation of kernel ridge regression (KRR), or as a stylized model for neural networks in the so called lazy training regime.	
 Glioblastoma Multiforme Patient Survival Prediction	Snehal Rajput, Rupal Agravat, Mohendra Roy, Mehul Raval	None	None	Glioblastoma Multiforme is a very aggressive type of brain tumor. Due to spatial and temporal intra-tissue inhomogeneity, location and the extent of the cancer tissue, it is difficult to detect and dissect the tumor regions. In this paper, we propose survival prognosis models using four regressors operating on handcrafted image-based and radiomics features. We hypothesize that the radiomics shape features have the highest correlation with survival prediction. The proposed approaches were assessed on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS-2020) challenge dataset. The highest accuracy of image features with random forest regressor approach was 51.5% for the training and 51.7% for the validation dataset. The gradient boosting regressor with shape features gave an accuracy of 91.5% and 62.1% on training and validation datasets respectively. It is better than the BraTS 2020 survival prediction challenge winners on the training and validation datasets. Our work shows that handcrafted features exhibit a strong correlation with survival prediction. The consensus based regressor with gradient boosting and radiomics shape features is the best combination for survival prediction.	
 Stabilizing current-driven steady flows of 180^‚àò domain walls in spin valves by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction	Jiaxin Du, Mei Li, Jie Lu	None	None	Modulations of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) on current-driven dynamics of 180 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT domain walls (180DWs) in long and narrow spin valves (LNSVs) with heavy-metal caplayers are systematically investigated. We focus on LNSVs with in-plane magnetic anisotropy in their free layers. For planar-transverse polarizers (pinned layers of LNSVs), the Walker breakdown can be postponed considerably (practical infinity) by iDMI. More interestingly, the originally unstable traveling mode is also stabilized by iDMI with high saturation velocity thus serves as fast carrier of information. For parallel polarizers, the Walker limit is increased and the corresponding modifications of iDMI to wall velocity in both steady and precessional flows of 180DWs are provided. For perpendicular polarizers, precessional flow of 180DWs is absent due to the stability of stationary mode beyond the modified Walker limit. For LNSVs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in their free layers, similar results are obtained. Our findings open new possibilities for developing magnetic nanodevices based on 180DW propagation with low energy consumption and high robustness.

Humanoid robots built with a purely tree type architecture tend to be bulky and usually suffer from velocity and force/torque limitations. This paper presents a novel series-parallel hybrid humanoid called RH5 which is 2 m tall and weighs only 62.5 kg capable of performing heavy-duty dynamic tasks with 5 kg payloads in each hand. The analysis and control of this humanoid is performed with whole-body trajectory optimization technique based on differential dynamic programming (DDP). Additionally, we present an improved contact stability soft-constrained DDP algorithm which is able to generate physically consistent walking trajectories for the humanoid that can be tracked via a simple PD position control in a physics simulator. Finally, we showcase preliminary experimental results on the RH5 humanoid robot.	
 Note on bi-exactness for creation operators on Fock spaces	Kei Hasegawa, Yusuke Isono, Tomohiro Kanda	None	None	In this note, we introduce and study a notion of bi-exactness for creation operators acting on full, symmetric and anti-symmetric Fock spaces. This is a generalization of our previous work, in which we studied the case of anti-symmetric Fock spaces. As a result, we obtain new examples of solid actions as well as new proofs for some known solid actions. We also study free wreath product groups in the same context.	
 1 Introduction			None	The study of wavelets, originated from it‚Äôs applications in diverse fields, was combined together by it‚Äôs Mathematical properties. Initially, all the wavelets and it‚Äôs variants were explored in the real space ‚Ñù n superscript ‚Ñù ùëõ \mathbb{R}^{n} blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . But now, these are being studied in different abstract settings. The present paper also contributes to this extension. Vilenkin groups, introduced by F. Ya Vilenkin, form a class of locally compact abelian groups. In this paper, Parseval frame multiwavelets associated to multiresolution analysis (MRA) are characterized in L 2 ( G ) superscript ùêø 2 ùê∫ L^{2}(G) italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_G ) , where G ùê∫ G italic_G is the Vilenkin group. Further, we introduce the pseudo-scaling function along with a class of generalized low pass filters and study their properties in Vilenkin group.	
 ‚ãÜ-Cohomology, Connes-Chern Characters, and Anomalies in General Translation-Invariant Noncommutative Yang-Mills	Amir Abbass Varshovi	ab.varshovi@sci.ui.ac.ir/amirabbassv@ipm.ir/varshoviamirabbass@gmail.com	None	Abstract: Topological structure of translation-invariant noncommutative Yang-Mills theoris are studied by means of a cohomology theory, so called ‚ãÜ ‚ãÜ \star ‚ãÜ -cohomology, which plays an intermediate role between de Rham and cyclic (co)homology theory for noncommutative algebras and gives rise to a cohomological formulation comparable to Seiberg-Witten map.	
 Probability Trajectory: One New Movement Description for Trajectory Prediction	Pei Lv, Hui Wei, Tianxin Gu, Yuzhen Zhang, Xiaoheng Jiang, Bing Zhou, Mingliang Xuielvpei,iexhjiang,iebzhou,iexumingliangzzueducn,weihui,txgu,zyzzhanggszzueducn	None	None	Trajectory prediction is a fundamental and challenging task for numerous applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent robots. Currently, most of existing works treat the pedestrian trajectory as a series of fixed two-dimensional coordinates. However, in real scenarios, the trajectory often exhibits randomness, and has its own probability distribution. Inspired by this observed fact, also considering other movement characteristics of pedestrians, we propose one simple and intuitive movement description, probability trajectory, which maps the coordinate points of the pedestrian trajectory to a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution in space. Based on this unique description, we develop one novel trajectory prediction method, called Social Probability . The method combines the probability trajectory and powerful convolution recurrent neural networks together. Both the input and output of our method are probability trajectories, which provide the recurrent neural network with sufficient spatial and random information of moving pedestrians. Furthermore, the Social Probability extracts spatio-temporal features directly on the new movement description to generate robust and accurate predicted results. The experiments on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	
 Tverberg‚Äôs theorem for cell complexes	Sho Hasui, Daisuke Kishimoto, Masahiro Takeda, Tsutaya	s.hasui@ms.osakafu-u.ac.jp	Department of Mathematical Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, 599-8531, Japan	The topological Tverberg theorem states that any continuous map of a ( d + 1 ) ( r ‚àí 1 ) ùëë 1 ùëü 1 (d+1)(r-1) ( italic_d + 1 ) ( italic_r - 1 ) -simplex into the Euclidean d ùëë d italic_d -space maps some points from r ùëü r italic_r pairwise disjoint faces of the simplex to the same point whenever r ùëü r italic_r is a prime power. We substantially generalize this theorem to continuous maps of certain CW complexes, including simplicial ( ( d + 1 ) ( r ‚àí 1 ) ‚àí 1 ) ùëë 1 ùëü 1 1 ((d+1)(r-1)-1) ( ( italic_d + 1 ) ( italic_r - 1 ) - 1 ) -spheres, into the Euclidean d ùëë d italic_d -space. We also discuss the atomicity of the Tverberg property.	
 The Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator: a fair stochastic tool to handle abruptly stopped football seasons	Hans Van Eetvelde, Lars Magnus Hvattum, Christophe Ley	None	None	The COVID-19 pandemic has left its marks in the sports world, forcing the full-stop of all sports-related activities in the first half of 2020. Football leagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.	
 Post-Newtonian properties of EMRI with Power Law Potential	Chinmay Gandevikar, Divyesh Solanki, Dipanjan Dey	cgandevikar@gmail.com	None	There are many astrophysical scenarios where extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) binaries can be surrounded by matter distribution. The distribution of mass can affect the dynamical properties (e.g. orbital frequency, average energy radiation rate, etc.) of the EMRI. In this matter distribution, instead of Kepler-Newton potential, one may consider a more general form of potential i.e. power law potential. Moreover, due to the power law potential, the velocity profile of test particles does not fall as much as that predicted by Kepler-Newton potential and this feature of the velocity profile may be observationally important. In this study, we have obtained the first post-Newtonian (1PN) expressions for dynamical quantities and the average energy radiation rate from the circular orbit EMRI which is surrounded by a matter distribution. We show that the energy radiation rate and orbital frequency of EMRI can be significantly different in the presence of power law potential as compared to that in the Kepler-Newton potential, signatures of which may be observed in gravitational waves from EMRI.	
 A Survey and Analysis on Automated Glioma Brain Tumor Segmentation and Overall Patient Survival Prediction The article has been published in Springer Journal, ‚ÄúArchives of Computational Methods in Engineering‚Äù, which is accessible using the link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-021-09559-w. One can access the article with complementary access rights using the link:https://rdcu.be/cf2Zz.	Rupal Agravat, Mehul Raval	None	None	Glioma is the deadliest brain tumor with high mortality. Treatment planning by human experts depends on the proper diagnosis of physical symptoms along with Magnetic Resonance (MR) image analysis. Highly variability of a brain tumor in terms of size, shape, location, and a high volume of MR images make the analysis time-consuming. Automatic segmentation methods achieve a reduction in time with excellent reproducible results. The article aims to survey the advancement of automated methods for Glioma brain tumor segmentation. It is also essential to make an objective evaluation of various models based on the benchmark. Therefore, the 2012 - 2019 BraTS challenges evaluate the state-of-the-art methods. The complexity of the tasks facing this challenge has grown from segmentation (Task 1) to overall survival prediction (Task 2) to uncertainty prediction for classification (Task 3). The paper covers the complete gamut of brain tumor segmentation using handcrafted features to deep neural network models for Task 1. The aim is to showcase a complete change of trends in automated brain tumor models. The paper also covers end to end joint models involving brain tumor segmentation and overall survival prediction. All the methods are probed, and parameters that affect performance are tabulated and analyzed.	
 Enhancing the spin-photon coupling with a micromagnet	XinLei Hei, XingLiang Dong, JiaQiang Chen, CaiPeng Shen, YiFan Qiao, PengBo Li	None	None	Hybrid quantum systems involving solid-state spins and superconducting microwave cavities play a crucial role in quantum science and technology, but improving the spin-photon coupling at the single quantum level remains challenging in such systems. Here, we propose a simple technique to strongly couple a single solid-state spin to the microwave photons in a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) cavity via a magnetic microsphere. We show that, strong coupling at the single spin level can be realized by virtual magnonic excitations of a nearby micromagnet. The spin-photon coupling strength can be enhanced up to typically four orders of magnitude larger than that without the use of the micromagnet. This work can find applications in quantum information processing with strongly coupled solid-state spin-photonic systems.	
 Supercurrent decay in ballistic magnetic Josephson junctions	Herv Ness, Ivan Sadovskyy, Andrey Antipov, Mark van Schilfgaarde, Roman Lutchyn	None	None	We investigate transport properties of ballistic magnetic Josephson junctions and establish that suppression of supercurrent is an intrinsic property of the junctions, even in absence of disorder. By studying the role of ferromagnet thickness, magnetization, and crystal orientation we show how the supercurrent decays exponentially with thickness and identify two mechanisms responsible for the effect: (i) large exchange splitting may gap out minority or majority carriers leading to the suppression of Andreev reflection in the junction, (ii) loss of synchronization between different modes due to the significant dispersion of the quasiparticle velocity with the transverse momentum. Our results for Nb/Ni/Nb junctions are in good agreement with recent experimental studies. Our approach combines density functional theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes model and opens a path for material composition optimization in magnetic Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic spin valves.	
 Patterns for Representing Knowledge Graphs to Communicate Situational Knowledge of Service Robots	Shengchen Zhang, Zixuan Wang, Chaoran Chen, Yi Dai, Lyumanshan Ye, Xiaohua Sun	shengchenzhang1207@gmail.com	None	Service robots are envisioned to be adaptive to their working environment based on situational knowledge. Recent research focused on designing visual representation of knowledge graphs for expert users. However, how to generate an understandable interface for non-expert users remains to be explored. In this paper, we use knowledge graphs (KGs) as a common ground for knowledge exchange and develop a pattern library for designing KG interfaces for non-expert users. After identifying the types of robotic situational knowledge from the literature, we present a formative study in which participants used cards to communicate the knowledge for given scenarios. We iteratively coded the results and identified patterns for representing various types of situational knowledge. To derive design recommendations for applying the patterns, we prototyped a lab service robot and conducted Wizard-of-Oz testing. The patterns and recommendations could provide useful guidance in designing knowledge-exchange interfaces for robots.	
 System size dependence of baryon-strangeness correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions from a multiphase transport model	DongFang Wang, Song Zhang, YuGang Ma	None	None	The system size dependence of baryon-strangeness (BS) correlations ( C B S subscript ùê∂ ùêµ ùëÜ C_{BS} italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_B italic_S end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) are investigated with a multiphase transport (AMPT) model for various collision systems from B 10 + 10 B superscript 10 superscript B 10 B \mathrm{{}^{10}B+^{10}B} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 10 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_B + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_B , C 12 + 12 C superscript 12 superscript C 12 C \mathrm{{}^{12}C+^{12}C} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_C + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_C , O 16 + 16 O superscript 16 superscript O 16 O \mathrm{{}^{16}O+^{16}O} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_O + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_O , Ne 20 + 20 Ne superscript 20 superscript Ne 20 Ne \mathrm{{}^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 20 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_Ne + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 20 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Ne , Ca 40 + 40 Ca superscript 40 superscript Ca 40 Ca \mathrm{{}^{40}Ca+^{40}Ca} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 40 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_Ca + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 40 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Ca , Zr 96 + 96 Zr superscript 96 superscript Zr 96 Zr \mathrm{{}^{96}Zr+^{96}Zr} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 96 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_Zr + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 96 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Zr , and Au 197 + 197 Au superscript 197 superscript Au 197 Au \mathrm{{}^{197}Au+^{197}Au} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 197 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_Au + start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 197 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Au at RHIC energies s N N subscript ùë† ùëÅ ùëÅ \sqrt{s_{NN}} square-root start_ARG italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG of 200, 39, 27, 20, and 7.7 GeV. Both effects of hadron rescattering and a combination of different hadrons play a leading role for baryon-strangeness correlations. When the kinetic window is limited to absolute rapidity | y | > 3 ùë¶ 3 |y|>3 | italic_y | > 3 , these correlations tend to be constant after the final-state interaction whatever kind of hadrons subset we chose based on the AMPT framework.

 Moderate-temperature near-field thermophotovoltaic systems with thin-film InSb cells	Rongqian Wang, Jincheng Lu, JianHua Jiang	rongqianwang@sina.com	None	Near-field thermophotovoltaic systems functioning at 400 ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 900 K based on graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride heterostructures and thin-film InSb p ùëù p italic_p - n ùëõ n italic_n junctions are investigated theoretically. The performances of two near-field systems with different emitters are examined carefully. One near-field system consists of a graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride-graphene sandwich structure as the emitter, while the other system has an emitter made of the double graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride heterostructure. It is shown that both systems exhibit higher output power density and energy efficiency than the near-field system based on mono graphene-hexagonal-boron-nitride heterostructure. The optimal output power density of the former device can reach to 1.3 √ó 10 5 W ‚ãÖ m ‚àí 2 ‚ãÖ 1.3 superscript 10 5 W superscript m 2 1.3\times 10^{5}~{}\rm{W\cdot m^{-2}} 1.3 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_W ‚ãÖ roman_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , while the optimal energy efficiency can be as large as 42 % percent 42 42\% 42 % of the Carnot efficiency. We analyze the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to the excellent performances of the proposed near-field thermophotovoltaic systems. Our results are valuable toward high-performance moderate temperature thermophotovoltaic systems as appealing thermal-to-electric energy conversion (waste heat harvesting) devices.	
 The Granularity Gap Problem: A Hurdle for Applying Approximate Memory to Complex Data Layout*	Soramichi Akiyama, Ryota Shioya	akiyama@ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp	None	The main memory access latency has not much improved for more than two decades while the CPU performance had been exponentially increasing until recently. Approximate memory is a technique to reduce the DRAM access latency in return of losing data integrity. It is beneficial for applications that are robust to noisy input and intermediate data such as artificial intelligence, multimedia processing, and graph processing. To obtain reasonable outputs from applications on approximate memory, it is crucial to protect critical data while accelerating accesses to non-critical data. We refer the minimum size of a continuous memory region that the same error rate is applied in approximate memory to as the approximation granularity . A fundamental limitation of approximate memory is that the approximation granularity is as large as a few kilo bytes. However, applications may have critical and non-critical data interleaved with smaller granularity. For example, a data structure for graph nodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score (non-critical, depending on the use-case). This data structure cannot be directly mapped to approximate memory due to the gap between the approximation granularity and the granularity of data criticality. We refer to this issue as the granularity gap problem . In this paper, we first show that many applications potentially suffer from this problem. Then we propose a framework to quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead of a possible method to avoid this problem using known techniques. The evaluation results show that the performance overhead is non-negligible compared to expected benefit from approximate memory, suggesting that the granularity gap problem is a significant concern. ‚Ä† ‚Ä† *This is an extended version of our conference paper published in the 12 th normal-th {}^{\rm th} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT roman_th end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE).

 Large Zeeman Splitting in Out-of-Plane Magnetic Field in a Double-Layer Quantum Point Contact	Daiju TerasawastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Shota NorimotostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tomonori Arakawa,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Meydi Ferrier,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Akira FukudastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Kensuke Kobayashi,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Yoshiro HirayamastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this study, we observe that the conductance of a quantum point contact on a GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well depends significantly on the magnetic field perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron gas. In the presence of the magnetic field, the subband edge splitting due to the Zeeman energy reaches 0.09 meV at 0.16 T, thereby suggesting an enhanced g ùëî g italic_g -factor. The estimated g ùëî g italic_g -factor enhancement is 17.5 times that of the bare value. It is considered that a low electron density and high mobility makes it possible to reach a strong many-body interaction regime in which this type of strong enhancement in g ùëî g italic_g -factor can be observed.	
 On the distributions of some statistics related to adaptive filters trained with ùë°-distributed samples	Olivier Besson	None	None	In this paper we analyse the behaviour of adaptive filters or detectors when they are trained with t ùë° t italic_t -distributed samples rather than Gaussian distributed samples. More precisely we investigate the impact on the distribution of some relevant statistics including the signal to noise ratio loss and the Gaussian generalized likelihood ratio test. Some properties of partitioned complex F ùêπ F italic_F distributed matrices are derived which enable to obtain statistical representations in terms of independent chi-square distributed random variables. These representations are compared with their Gaussian counterparts and numerical simulations illustrate and quantify the induced degradation.	
 Effective Lagrangian for Non-Abelian Two-Dimensional Topological Field Theory	Pongwit Srisangyingcharoen, Paul Mansfield	pongwit.srisangyingcharoen@durham.ac.uk, pongwits@nu.ac.th	None	We develop a systematic approach to obtain an effective Lagrangian for 2 D 2 ùê∑ 2D 2 italic_D non-Abelian topological BF theory. A general expression is presented in a diagrammatic representation containing solely scalar fields. Expressions for the S U ( 2 ) ùëÜ ùëà 2 SU(2) italic_S italic_U ( 2 ) and S U ( 3 ) ùëÜ ùëà 3 SU(3) italic_S italic_U ( 3 ) effective actions are explicitly stated. In the case of S U ( 2 ) ùëÜ ùëà 2 SU(2) italic_S italic_U ( 2 ) , we show that the effective action can be interpreted as a winding number. By using the S U ( 2 ) ùëÜ ùëà 2 SU(2) italic_S italic_U ( 2 ) effective action, the partition function on a sphere for S U ( 2 ) ùëÜ ùëà 2 SU(2) italic_S italic_U ( 2 ) Yang-Mills theory is calculated. Moreover, we generalise the theory to include a source term for the gauge field as well as calculate the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop based on the effective theory.	
 Demystifying strange metal and violation of Luttinger theorem in a doped Mott insulator	WeiWei Yang, Yin Zhong, HongGang Luo	None	None	Metallic states coined strange metal (SM), with robust linear- T ùëá T italic_T resistivity, have been widely observed in many quantum materials under strong electron correlation, ranging from high- T c subscript ùëá ùëê T_{c} italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT cuprate superconductor, organic superconductor to twisted multilayer graphene and MoTe 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT /WSe 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT superlattice. Despite decades of intensive studies, the mystery of strange metal still defies any sensible theoretical explanation and has been the key puzzle in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we solve a doped Mott insulator model, which unambiguously exhibits SM phenomena accompanied with quantum critical scaling in observables, e.g. resistivity, susceptibility and specific heat. Closer look at SM reveals the breakdown of Landau‚Äôs Fermi liquid without any symmetry-breaking, i.e. the violation of Luttinger theorem. Examining electron‚Äôs self-energy extracted from numerical simulation provides the explanation on the origin of linear- T ùëá T italic_T resistivity and suggests that the long-overlooked static fluctuations in literature play an essential role in non-Fermi liquid behaviors in correlated electron systems.	
 The Benson - Symonds invariant for Ordinary and signed permutation modules	Aparna Upadhyay	aparnaup@buffalo.edu	Department of MathematicsUniversity at Buffalo, SUNY244 Mathematics BuildingBuffalo, NY¬†14260, USA	The signed permutation modules are a simultaneous generalization of the ordinary permutation modules and the twisted permutation modules of the symmetric group.

 Observability for heat equations with memory	Gengsheng Wang, Yubiao Zhang, Enrique Zuazua	None	None	This paper studies the observability of heat equations with real analytic memory kernels. More precisely, we characterize the geometry on observation sets that ensure several observability inequalities, including two‚Äìside inequalities. By an observation set, we mean the space‚Äìtime support of an observer, which is chosen to be measurable. In addition, some applications to control are presented. The main components used to obtain our results are as follows: 1) the decomposition theorem given in [ 36 ] , 2) the time‚Äìanalyticity for solutions of our equations, 3) a modified three‚Äìstep strategy, and 4) an estimate for solutions of the pure heat equation.

         Joint senior authors"	None	Brain function relies on a precisely coordinated and dynamic balance between the functional integration and segregation of distinct neural systems. Characterizing the way in which neural systems reconfigure their interactions to give rise to distinct but hidden brain states remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model-based characterization of latent brain states and showcase a novel method based on posterior predictive discrepancy using the latent block model to detect transitions between latent brain states in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. The set of estimated parameters in the model includes a latent label vector that assigns network nodes to communities, and also block model parameters that reflect the weighted connectivity within and between communities. Besides extensive in-silico model evaluation, we also provide empirical validation (and replication) using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset of 100 healthy adults. Our results obtained through an analysis of task-fMRI data during working memory performance show appropriate lags between external task demands and change-points between brain states, with distinctive community patterns distinguishing fixation, low-demand and high-demand task conditions.	
 Local shape of the vapor-liquid critical point on the thermodynamic surface and the van der Waals equation of state	Yu, Zhou, Chen, Du, Wang, Liu, 	None	None	Differential geometry is powerful tool to analyze the vapor-liquid critical point on the surface of the thermodynamic equation of state. The existence of usual condition of the critical point ( ‚àÇ p / ‚àÇ V ) T = 0 subscript ùëù ùëâ ùëá 0 \left(\partial p/\partial V\right)_{T}=0 ( ‚àÇ italic_p / ‚àÇ italic_V ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0 requires the isothermal process, but the universality of the critical point is its independence of whatever process is taken, and so we can assume ( ‚àÇ p / ‚àÇ T ) V = 0 subscript ùëù ùëá ùëâ 0 \left(\partial p/\partial T\right)_{V}=0 ( ‚àÇ italic_p / ‚àÇ italic_T ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0 .

A slight extension of the van der Waals equation of state is to letting two parameters a ùëé a italic_a and b ùëè b italic_b in it vary with temperature, which then satisfies both assumptions and reproduces its usual form when the temperature is approximately the critical one.

 Graphonomy: Universal Image Parsing via Graph Reasoning and Transfer	Liang Lin, Yiming Gao, Ke Gong, Meng Wang, and Xiaodan Liang	None	None	Prior highly-tuned image parsing models are usually studied in a certain domain with a specific set of semantic labels and can hardly be adapted into other scenarios ( e . g .sharing discrepant label granularity) without extensive re-training. Learning a single universal parsing model by unifying label annotations from different domains or at various levels of granularity is a crucial but rarely addressed topic. This poses many fundamental learning challenges, e . g .discovering underlying semantic structures among different label granularity or mining label correlation across relevant tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a graph reasoning and transfer learning framework, named ‚ÄúGraphonomy‚Äù, which incorporates human knowledge and label taxonomy into the intermediate graph representation learning beyond local convolutions. In particular, Graphonomy learns the global and structured semantic coherency in multiple domains via semantic-aware graph reasoning and transfer, enforcing the mutual benefits of the parsing across domains ( e . g .different datasets or co-related tasks). The Graphonomy includes two iterated modules: Intra-Graph Reasoning and Inter-Graph Transfer modules. The former extracts the semantic graph in each domain to improve the feature representation learning by propagating information with the graph; the latter exploits the dependencies among the graphs from different domains for bidirectional knowledge transfer. We apply Graphonomy to two relevant but different image understanding research topics: human parsing and panoptic segmentation, and show Graphonomy can handle both of them well via a standard pipeline against current state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, some extra benefit of our framework is demonstrated, e . g ., generating the human parsing at various levels of granularity by unifying annotations across different datasets.

 Measuring the Distance and ZAMS Mass of Galactic Core-Collapse Supernovae Using Neutrinos	Manne Segerlund, Erin OSullivan, Evan OConnor	None	None	Neutrinos from a Galactic core-collapse supernova will be measured by neutrino detectors minutes to days before an optical signal reaches Earth. We present a novel calculation showing the ability of current and near-future neutrino detectors to make fast predictions of the progenitor distance and place constraints on the zero-age main sequence mass in order to inform the observing strategy for electromagnetic follow-up. We show that for typical Galactic supernovae, the distance can be constrained with an uncertainty of ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 5% using IceCube or Hyper-K and, furthermore, the zero-age main sequence mass can be constrained for extremal values of compactness.

 Robust Finite-Time Consensus Subject to Unknown Communication Time Delays Based on Delay-Dependent Criteria	MaryamSharifi	None	None	In this paper, robust finite-time consensus of a group of nonlinear multi-agent systems in the presence of communication time delays is considered. In particular, appropriate delay-dependent strategies which are less conservative are suggested. Sufficient conditions for finite-time consensus in the presence of deterministic and stochastic disturbances are presented. The communication delays don‚Äôt need to be time invariant, uniform, symmetric, or even known. The only required condition is that all delays satisfy a known upper bound. The consensus algorithm is appropriate for agents with partial access to neighbor agents‚Äô signals. The Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem for finite-time convergence is used to prove the results. Simulation results on a group of mobile robot manipulators as the agents of the system are presented.	
 Independent Control and Path Planning of Microswimmers with a Uniform Magnetic Field			None	Artificial bacteria flagella (ABFs) are magnetic helical micro-swimmers that can be remotely controlled via a uniform, rotating magnetic field. Previous studies have used the heterogeneous response of microswimmers to external magnetic fields for achieving independent control. Here we introduce analytical and reinforcement learning control strategies for path planning to a target by multiple swimmers using a uniform magnetic field. The comparison of the two algorithms shows the superiority of reinforcement learning in achieving minimal travel time to a target. The results demonstrate, for the first time, the effective independent navigation of realistic micro-swimmers with a uniform magnetic field in a viscous flow field.

 Open Quantum Dynamics Theory for Non-Equilibrium Work: Hierarchical Equations of Motion Approach	Souichi Sakamoto and Yoshitaka TanimurastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	A system‚Äìbath (SB) model is considered to examine the Jarzynski equality in the fully quantum regime. In our previous paper [J. Chem. Phys. 153 (2020) 234107], we carried out ‚Äúexact‚Äù numerical experiments using hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) in which we demonstrated that the SB model describes behavior that is consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics and that the dynamics of the total system are time irreversible. The distinctive quantity in the Jarzynski equality is the ‚Äúwork characteristic function (WCF)‚Äù, ‚ü® exp ‚Å° [ ‚àí Œ≤ W ] ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© ùõΩ ùëä \langle\exp[-\beta W]\rangle ‚ü® roman_exp [ - italic_Œ≤ italic_W ] ‚ü© , where W ùëä W italic_W is the work performed on the system and Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ is the inverse temperature. In the present investigation, we consider the definitions based on the partition function (PF) and on the path, and numerically evaluate the WCF using the HEOM to determine a method for extending the Jarzynski equality to the fully quantum regime. We show that using the PF-based definition of the WCF, we obtain a result that is entirely inconsistent with the Jarzynski equality, while if we use the path-based definition, we obtain a result that approximates the Jarzynski equality, but may not be consistent with it.

 ResLT: Residual Learning for Long-tailed Recognition	JiequanCui,ShuLiu,ZhuotaoTian,ZhishengZhong,JiayaJia	None	None	Deep learning algorithms face great challenges with long-tailed data distribution which, however, is quite a common case in real-world scenarios. Previous methods tackle the problem from either the aspect of input space (re-sampling classes with different frequencies) or loss space (re-weighting classes with different weights), suffering from heavy over-fitting to tail classes or hard optimization during training. To alleviate these issues, we propose a more fundamental perspective for long-tailed recognition, i.e. , from the aspect of parameter space, and aims to preserve specific capacity for classes with low frequencies. From this perspective, the trivial solution utilizes different branches for the head, medium, tail classes respectively, and then sums their outputs as the final results is not feasible. Instead, we design the effective residual fusion mechanism ‚Äì with one main branch optimized to recognize images from all classes, another two residual branches are gradually fused and optimized to enhance images from medium+tail classes and tail classes respectively. Then the branches are aggregated into final results by additive shortcuts. We test our method on several benchmarks, i.e. , long-tailed version of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places, ImageNet, and iNaturalist 2018. Experimental results manifest the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiequancui/ResLT .	
 1 Introduction			None	Heavy fields of Hubble scale order present during inflation contribute to the non-Gaussian signature for the three-point function of the inflaton. Taking into account that Hubble scale is around the scale of grand unified theory (GUT), this opens a possibility that the GUT scale signatures, which are very hard to be discovered at collider, might be detectable by using information from the precise observations of cosmic microwave background. We discuss a detactability of the X , Y ùëã ùëå X,Y italic_X , italic_Y gauge boson present in any GUT in a framework of cosmological collider physics. Calculating one-loop contributions of X , Y ùëã ùëå X,Y italic_X , italic_Y gauge bosons to the inflaton three-point functions, we find a remarkable result that one-loop diagram with interactions originated from the mass terms of X , Y ùëã ùëå X,Y italic_X , italic_Y gauge bosons provides an enhancement factor expressed by the ratio between the X , Y ùëã ùëå X,Y italic_X , italic_Y gauge boson mass and Hubble scale as ( m X / H ) 4 superscript subscript ùëö ùëã ùêª 4 (m_{X}/H)^{4} ( italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_H ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . In an estimation of the non-Gaussianity, this factor is crucial and its impact on the detactability of X , Y ùëã ùëå X,Y italic_X , italic_Y gauge bosons is discussed.	
 The Market Measure of Carbon Risk and its Impact on the Minimum Variance Portfolio11footnote 1The authors are grateful to Martin Nerlinger from the University of Augsburg, who provided them with the time series of the BMG risk factor (see https://carima-project.de/en/downloads for more details about this carbon risk factor). They would also like to thank Melchior Dechelette, Lauren Stagnol and Bruno Taillardat for their helpful comments.	Master in Bioinformatics BiostatisticsUniversity ParisSaclay, Paris, Quantitative ResearchAmundi Asset Management, France	None	None	Like ESG investing, climate change is an important concern for asset managers and owners, and a new challenge for portfolio construction. Until now, investors have mainly measured carbon risk using fundamental approaches, such as with carbon intensity metrics. Nevertheless, it has not been proven that asset prices are directly impacted by these fundamental-based measures. In this paper, we focus on another approach, which consists in measuring the sensitivity of stock prices with respect to a carbon risk factor. In our opinion, carbon betas are market-based measures that are complementary to carbon intensities or fundamental-based measures when managing investment portfolios, because carbon betas may be viewed as an extension or forward-looking measure of the current carbon footprint. In particular, we show how this new metric can be used to build minimum variance strategies and how they impact their portfolio construction.	
 Semi-supervised source localization in reverberant environments with deep generative modeling	MICHAEL BIANCO, , SHARON GANNOT, , EFREN FERNANDEZGRANDE, and PETER GERSTOFT, 	None	Marine Physical Laboratory, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA	We propose a semi-supervised approach to acoustic source localization in reverberant environments based on deep generative modeling. Localization in reverberant environments remains an open challenge. Even with large data volumes, the number of labels available for supervised learning in reverberant environments is usually small. We address this issue by performing semi-supervised learning (SSL) with convolutional variational autoencoders (VAEs) on reverberant speech signals recorded with microphone arrays. The VAE is trained to generate the phase of relative transfer functions (RTFs) between microphones, in parallel with a direction of arrival (DOA) classifier based on RTF-phase. These models are trained using both labeled and unlabeled RTF-phase sequences. In learning to perform these tasks, the VAE-SSL explicitly learns to separate the physical causes of the RTF-phase (i.e., source location) from distracting signal characteristics such as noise and speech activity. Relative to existing semi-supervised localization methods in acoustics, VAE-SSL is effectively an end-to-end processing approach which relies on minimal preprocessing of RTF-phase features. As far as we are aware, our paper presents the first approach to modeling the physics of acoustic propagation using deep generative modeling. The VAE-SSL approach is compared with two signal processing-based approaches, steered response power with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) and MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC), as well as fully supervised CNNs. We find that VAE-SSL can outperform the conventional approaches and the CNN in label-limited scenarios. Further, the trained VAE-SSL system can generate new RTF-phase samples, which shows the VAE-SSL approach learns the physics of the acoustic environment. The generative modeling in VAE-SSL thus provides a means of interpreting the learned representations.	
 Enhanced electro-actuation in dielectric elastomers: the non-linear effect of free ions	Bin Zheng, Xingkun Man, David Andelman, Masao Doi	None	None	Plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is a jelly-like soft dielectric material that attracted substantial interest recently as a new type of electro-active polymers. Under electric fields of several hundred Volt/mm, PVC gels undergo large deformations. These gels can be used as artificial muscles and other soft robotic devices, with striking deformation behavior that is quite different from conventional dielectric elastomers. Here, we present a simple model for the electro-activity of PVC gels, and show a non-linear effect of free ions on its dielectric behaviors. It is found that their particular deformation behavior is due to an electro-wetting effect and to a change in their interfacial tension. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for the surface tension as well as for the apparent dielectric constant of the gel. The theory indicates that the size of the mobile free ions has a crucial role in determining the electro-induced deformation, opening up the way to novel and innovative designs of electro-active gel actuators.	
 Generalized optical theorem for Rayleigh scattering approximation	Irving Rondnand Jooyoung LeeSchool of Computational Sciences,Korea Institute for Advanced Study, Hoegiro, Seoul ,Republic of Korea	None	None	A general expression for the optical theorem for probe sources given in terms of propagation invariant beams is derived.

 Hierarchical Clustering via Sketches and Hierarchical Correlation Clustering	Danny Vainstein, Vaggos Chatziafratis, Gui Citovsky, Anand Rajagopalan, Mohammad Mahdian, Yossi Azar	None	None	Recently, Hierarchical Clustering (HC) has been considered through the lens of optimization. In particular, two maximization objectives have been defined. Moseley and Wang defined the Revenue objective to handle similarity information given by a weighted graph on the data points (w.l.o.g., [ 0 , 1 ] 0 1 [0,1] [ 0 , 1 ] weights), while Cohen-Addad et al. defined the Dissimilarity objective to handle dissimilarity information. In this paper, we prove structural lemmas for both objectives allowing us to convert any HC tree to a tree with constant number of internal nodes while incurring an arbitrarily small loss in each objective. Although the best-known approximations are 0.585 and 0.667 respectively, using our lemmas we obtain approximations arbitrarily close to 1, if not all weights are small (i.e., there exist constants œµ , Œ¥ italic-œµ ùõø \epsilon,\delta italic_œµ , italic_Œ¥ such that the fraction of weights smaller than Œ¥ ùõø \delta italic_Œ¥ , is at most 1 ‚àí œµ 1 italic-œµ 1-\epsilon 1 - italic_œµ ); such instances encompass many metric-based similarity instances, thereby improving upon prior work. Finally, we introduce Hierarchical Correlation Clustering (HCC) to handle instances that contain similarity and dissimilarity information simultaneously. For HCC, we provide an approximation of 0.4767 and for complementary similarity/dissimilarity weights (analogous to + ‚Å£ / ‚Å£ ‚àí +/- + / - correlation clustering), we again present nearly-optimal approximations.	
 Probability distributions for analog-to-target distances			None	Some properties of chaotic dynamical systems can be probed through features of recurrences, also called analogs. In practice, analogs are nearest neighbours of the state of a system, taken from a large database called the catalog. Analogs have been used in many atmospheric applications including forecasts, downscaling, predictability estimation, and attribution of extreme events. The distances of the analogs to the target state condition the performances of analog applications. These distances can be viewed as random variables, and their probability distributions can be related to the catalog size and properties of the system at stake. A few studies have focused on the first moments of return time statistics for the best analog, fixing an objective of maximum distance from this analog to the target state. However, for practical use and to reduce estimation variance, applications usually require not just one, but many analogs. In this paper, we evaluate from a theoretical standpoint and with numerical experiments the probability distributions of the K ùêæ K italic_K -best analog-to-target distances. We show that dimensionality plays a role on the size of the catalog needed to find good analogs, and also on the relative means and variances of the K ùêæ K italic_K -best analogs. Our results are based on recently developed tools from dynamical systems theory. These findings are illustrated with numerical simulations of a well-known chaotic dynamical system and on 10m-wind reanalysis data in north-west France. A practical application of our derivations for the purpose of objective-based dimension reduction is shown using the same reanalysis data.

 Evaluation of BERT and ALBERT Sentence Embedding Performance on Downstream NLP Tasks	Hyunjin Choi, Judong Kim, Seongho Joe, and Youngjune Gwon	None	None	Contextualized representations from a pre-trained language model are central to achieve a high performance on downstream NLP task. The pre-trained BERT and A Lite BERT (ALBERT) models can be fine-tuned to give state-of-the-art results in sentence-pair regressions such as semantic textual similarity (STS) and natural language inference (NLI). Although BERT-based models yield the [CLS] token vector as a reasonable sentence embedding, the search for an optimal sentence embedding scheme remains an active research area in computational linguistics. This paper explores on sentence embedding models for BERT and ALBERT. In particular, we take a modified BERT network with siamese and triplet network structures called Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and replace BERT with ALBERT to create Sentence-ALBERT (SALBERT). We also experiment with an outer CNN sentence-embedding network for SBERT and SALBERT. We evaluate performances of all sentence-embedding models considered using the STS and NLI datasets. The empirical results indicate that our CNN architecture improves ALBERT models substantially more than BERT models for STS benchmark. Despite significantly fewer model parameters, ALBERT sentence embedding is highly competitive to BERT in downstream NLP evaluations.

 Kinetic derivation of a time-dependent SEIRD reaction-diffusion system for COVID-19		zagourmohamed@gmail.com	Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es, Universit√© EuroMed F√®s, Maroc	In this paper, we propose a time-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Died (SEIRD) reaction-diffusion system for the COVID-19 pandemic and we deal with its derivation from a kinetic model. The derivation is obtained by mathematical description delivered at the micro-scale of individuals. Our approach is based on the micro-macro decomposition which leads to an equivalent formulation of the kinetic model which couples the microscopic equations with the macroscopic equations. We develop a numerical asymptotic preservation scheme to solve the kinetic model. The proposed approach is validated by various numerical tests where particular attention is paid to the Moroccan situation against the actual pandemic.	
 essHi-C: Essential component analysis of Hi-C matrices	Stefano Franzini, Marco Di Stefano, Cristian Micheletti	None	None	Motivation: Hi-C matrices are cornerstones for qualitative and quantitative studies of genome folding, from its territorial organization to compartments and topological domains. The high dynamic range of genomic distances probed in Hi-C assays reflects in an inherent stochastic background of the interactions matrices, which inevitably convolve the features of interest with largely aspecific ones. Results: Here we introduce a discuss essHi-C, a method to isolate the specific, or essential component of Hi-C matrices from the aspecific portion of the spectrum that is compatible with random matrices. Systematic comparisons show that essHi-C improves the clarity of the interaction patterns, enhances the robustness against sequencing depth, allows the unsupervised clustering of experiments in different cell lines and recovers the cell-cycle phasing of single-cells based on Hi-C data. Thus, essHi-C provides means for isolating significant biological and physical features from Hi-C matrices.

 Bundled string solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations in the non-Hermitian spin chain	Yuki IshigruostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jun SatostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Katsuhiro NishinaristartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	yk1496@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; j.sato@eng.t-kougei.ac.jp; tknishi@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp	11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan22{}^{2}s	The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a paradigmatic stochastic integrable system that describes nonequilibrium transport phenomena. In this paper, we investigate the solutions of the Bethe equations for the ASEP in the thermodynamic limit. The Bethe equations for many Hermitian integrable systems, such as the spin- 1 / 2 1 2 1/2 1 / 2 Heisenberg chain, have regular solutions called string solutions. However, in the case of the ASEP, the pattern of the string solution changes owing to its non-hermiticity. We call this new type of string solutions ‚Äúbundled string solutions‚Äù. We introduce and formulate the bundled string solutions, and then derive the Bethe-Takahashi equation for the ASEP.	
 Strategic Evasion of Centrality Measures	Marcin Waniek, Jan Wonica, Kai Zhou, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Talal Rahwan, Tomasz Michalak	None	None	Among the most fundamental tools for social network analysis are centrality measures, which quantify the importance of every node in the network. This centrality analysis typically disregards the possibility that the network may have been deliberately manipulated to mislead the analysis. To solve this problem, a recent study attempted to understand how a member of a social network could rewire the connections therein to avoid being identified as a leader of that network. However, the study was based on the assumption that the network analyzer‚Äîthe seeker‚Äîis oblivious to any evasion attempts by the evader. In this paper, we relax this assumption by modelling the seeker and evader as strategic players in a Bayesian Stackelberg game. In this context, we study the complexity of various optimization problems, and analyze the equilibria of the game under different assumptions, thereby drawing the first conclusions in the literature regarding which centralities the seeker should use to maximize the chances of detecting a strategic evader.	
 Analyzing Zero-shot Cross-lingual Transfer in Supervised NLP Tasks	Hyunjin Choi, Judong Kim, Seongho Joe, Seungjai Min, Youngjune Gwon	None	None	In zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, a supervised NLP task trained on a corpus in one language is directly applicable to another language without any additional training. A source of cross-lingual transfer can be as straightforward as lexical overlap between languages ( e.g. , use of the same scripts, shared subwords) that naturally forces text embeddings to occupy a similar representation space. Recently introduced cross-lingual language model (XLM) pretraining brings out neural parameter sharing in Transformer-style networks as the most important factor for the transfer. In this paper, we aim to validate the hypothetically strong cross-lingual transfer properties induced by XLM pretraining. Particularly, we take XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) in our experiments that extend semantic textual similarity (STS), SQuAD and KorQuAD for machine reading comprehension, sentiment analysis, and alignment of sentence embeddings under various cross-lingual settings. Our results indicate that the presence of cross-lingual transfer is most pronounced in STS, sentiment analysis the next, and MRC the last. That is, the complexity of a downstream task softens the degree of cross-lingual transfer. All of our results are empirically observed and measured, and we make our code and data publicly available.	
 Neural machine translation, corpus and frugality	Raoul Blin, CNRSCRLAO, blinehessfr	None	None	In machine translation field, in both academia and industry, there is a growing interest in increasingly powerful systems, using corpora of several hundred million to several billion examples. These systems represent the state-of-the-art. Here we defend the idea of developing in parallel ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù bilingual translation systems, trained with relatively small corpora. Based on the observation of a standard human professional translator, we estimate that the corpora should be composed at maximum of a monolingual sub-corpus of 75 million examples for the source language, a second monolingual sub-corpus of 6 million examples for the target language, and an aligned bilingual sub-corpus of 6 million bi-examples. A less desirable alternative would be an aligned bilingual corpus of 47.5 million bi-examples.

 Quasinormal modes of NUT-charged black branes in the AdS/CFT correspondence	Pablo Cano, and David Pereiguez	None	None	We study the scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of planar AdS 4 4 {}_{4} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 4 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT black holes with NUT charge. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, these solutions describe a thermal quantum field theory embedded in a G√∂del-type universe with closed time-like curves. For a given temperature and NUT charge, two different planar Taub-NUT solutions exist, but we show that only the one with a positive specific heat contributes to the Euclidean saddle point in the path integral. By using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we then derive the master equations satisfied by scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations in this background, and show that the corresponding equations are separable. Interestingly, the solutions pile up in the form of Landau levels, and hence are characterized by a single quantum number q ùëû q italic_q . We determine the appropriate boundary conditions satisfied by the master variables and using these we compute the quasinormal modes of scalar and gravitational perturbations. On the other hand, electromagnetic perturbations depend on a free parameter whose determination is problematic. We find that all the scalar and gravitational QNM frequencies lie in the lower half of the complex plane, indicating that these Taub-NUT spacetimes are stable. We discuss the implications of these results in the light of the AdS/CFT correspondence.	
 Electromagnetic transitions of the singly charmed baryons with spin 3/2	JuneYoung Kim, HyunChul Kim, GhilSeok Yang, Makoto Oka	Jun-Young.Kim@ruhr-uni-bochum.de	None	We investigate the electromagnetic transitions of the singly charmed baryons with spin 3/2, based on a pion mean-field approach, also known as the chiral quark-soliton model, taking into account the rotational 1 / N c 1 subscript ùëÅ ùëê 1/N_{c} 1 / italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT corrections and the effects of flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking.

Formulae for the nonlocal Darboux transformation are obtained and its relation to the generalized Moutard transformation is established.

 Variational Information Bottleneck Model for Accurate Indoor Position Recognition	Weizhu Qian, Franck Gechter	None	None	Recognizing user location with WiFi fingerprints is a popular approach for accurate indoor positioning problems. In this work, our goal is to interpret WiFi fingerprints into actual user locations. However, WiFi fingerprint data can be very high dimensional in some cases, we need to find a good representation of the input data for the learning task first. Otherwise, using neural networks will suffer from severe overfitting. In this work, we solve this issue by combining the Information Bottleneck method and Variational Inference. Based on these two approaches, we propose a Variational Information Bottleneck model for accurate indoor positioning. The proposed model consists of an encoder structure and a predictor structure. The encoder is to find a good representation in the input data for the learning task. The predictor is to use the latent representation to predict the final output. To enhance the generalization of our model, we also adopt the Dropout technique for each hidden layer of the decoder. We conduct the validation experiments on a real-world dataset. We also compare the proposed model to other existing methods so as to quantify the performances of our method.

 Dwarf galaxies in the MATLAS survey: Hubble Space Telescope observations of the globular cluster system in the ultra-diffuse galaxy MATLAS-2019	Oliver Mller, Patrick Durrell, Francine Marleau, PierreAlain Duc, Sungsoon Lim, Lorenzo Posti, Adriano Agnello, Rubn SnchezJanssen, Mlina Poulain, Rebecca Habas, Eric Emsellem, Sanjaya Paudel, Remco van der Burg, Jrmy Fensch	None	None	Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are very low-surface brightness galaxies with large effective radii. Spectroscopic measurements of a few UDGs have revealed a low dark matter content, based on the internal motion of stars or globular clusters (GCs). This is in contrast to the large number of GCs found for these systems, from which it would be expected to correspond to a large dark matter halo mass. Here we present HST+ACS observations for the UDG MATLAS-2019 in the NGC 5846 group. Using the F 606 W ùêπ 606 ùëä F606W italic_F 606 italic_W and F 814 W ùêπ 814 ùëä F814W italic_F 814 italic_W filters, we trace the GC population two magnitudes below the peak of the GC luminosity function (GCLF). Employing Bayesian considerations, we identify 26 ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 6 GCs associated with the dwarf, yielding a large specific frequency of S N = 58 ¬± 14 subscript ùëÜ ùëÅ plus-or-minus 58 14 S_{N}=58\pm 14 italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 58 ¬± 14 . We use the turnover of the GCLF to derive a distance of 21 ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 2 Mpc, which is consistent with the NGC 5846 group of galaxies. Due to the superior image quality of the HST, we are able to resolve the GCs and measure their sizes, which are consistent with the sizes of GCs around Local Group galaxies. Using the linear relation between the total mass of galaxies and of GCs, we derive a halo mass of 0.9 ¬± 0.2 √ó 10 11 plus-or-minus 0.9 0.2 superscript 10 11 0.9\pm 0.2\times 10^{11} 0.9 ¬± 0.2 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT (M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT /L > ‚äô 1000 {}_{\odot}>1000 start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT > 1000 ). The high abundance of GCs, together with the small uncertainties, make MATLAS-2019 one of the most extreme UDGs, which likely sets an upper limit of the number of GCs for UDGs.

 Kirby diagrams and 5-colored graphs representing compact 4-manifolds	Maria Rita Casali, Paola Cristofori	None	None	It is well-known that in dimension 4 any framed link ( L , c ) ùêø ùëê (L,c) ( italic_L , italic_c ) uniquely represents the PL 4-manifold M 4 ( L , c ) superscript ùëÄ 4 ùêø ùëê M^{4}(L,c) italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_L , italic_c ) obtained from ùîª 4 superscript ùîª 4 \mathbb{D}^{4} blackboard_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT by adding 2-handles along ( L , c ) ùêø ùëê (L,c) ( italic_L , italic_c ) . Moreover, if trivial dotted components are also allowed (i.e. in case of a Kirby diagram ( L ( * ) , d ) superscript ùêø ùëë (L^{(*)},d) ( italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ) ), the associated PL 4-manifold M 4 ( L ( * ) , d ) superscript ùëÄ 4 superscript ùêø ùëë M^{4}(L^{(*)},d) italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ) is obtained from ùîª 4 superscript ùîª 4 \mathbb{D}^{4} blackboard_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT by adding 1-handles along the dotted components and 2-handles along the framed components. In this paper we study the relationships between framed links and/or Kirby diagrams and the representation theory of compact PL manifolds by edge-colored graphs: in particular, we describe how to construct algorithmically a (regular) 5-colored graph representing M 4 ( L ( * ) , d ) superscript ùëÄ 4 superscript ùêø ùëë M^{4}(L^{(*)},d) italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ) , directly ‚Äúdrawn over‚Äù a planar diagram of ( L ( * ) , d ) superscript ùêø ùëë (L^{(*)},d) ( italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ) , or equivalently how to algorithmically obtain a triangulation of M 4 ( L ( * ) , d ) superscript ùëÄ 4 superscript ùêø ùëë M^{4}(L^{(*)},d) italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ) . As a consequence, the procedure yields triangulations for any closed (simply-connected) PL 4-manifold admitting handle decompositions without 3-handles. Furthermore, upper bounds for both the invariants gem-complexity and regular genus of M 4 ( L ( * ) , d ) superscript ùëÄ 4 superscript ùêø ùëë M^{4}(L^{(*)},d) italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_d ) are obtained, in terms of the combinatorial properties of the Kirby diagram.

 Extreme case of density scaling: The Weeks-Chandler-Andersen system at low temperatures	Eman Attia, Jeppe Dyre, Ulf Pedersen	attia@ruc.dk	None	This paper studies numerically the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) system, which is shown to obey hidden scale invariance with a density-scaling exponent that varies from below 5 to above 500. This unprecedented variation makes it advantageous to use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm for tracing out isomorphs. Good isomorph invariance of structure and dynamics is observed over more than three orders of magnitude temperature variation. For all state points studied, the virial potential-energy correlation coefficient and the density-scaling exponent are controlled mainly by the temperature. Based on the assumption of statistically independent pair interactions, a mean-field theory is developed that rationalizes this finding and provides an excellent fit to data at low temperatures and densities.	
 Discontinuous Galerkin methods for semilinear elliptic boundary value problem	Jiajun Zhan, Liuqiang Zhong, Jie Peng	zhan@m.scnu.edu.cn	School of Mathematical Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, China	A discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for solving semilinear elliptic problem is developed and analyzed in this paper.

 Local homeostatic regulation of the spectral radius of echo-state networks	Fabian Schubert,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Claudius GrosstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None		Recurrent cortical networks provide reservoirs of states that are thought to play a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain. However, classical reservoir computing requires manual adjustments of global network parameters, particularly of the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix. It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is accessible to biological neural networks.	
 Global existence and uniform boundedness in a chemotaxis model with signal-dependent motility	Jie Jiang, Philippe Laurenot	jiang@apm.ac.cn, jiang@wipm.ac.cn	Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, HuBei Province, P.R. China	Global existence is established for classical solutions to a chemotaxis model with signal-dependent motility for a general class of motility functions Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ which may in particular decay in an arbitrary way at infinity.

 Evolutionary Multi-objective Architecture Search Framework: Application to COVID-19 3D CT Classification	Xin He, Guohao Ying, Jiyong Zhangdagger, Xiaowen Chudagger	None	None	The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened global health. Many studies have applied deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to recognize COVID-19 based on chest 3D computed tomography (CT). Recent works show that no model generalizes well across CT datasets from different countries, and manually designing models for specific datasets requires expertise; thus, neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to search models automatically has become an attractive solution. To reduce the search cost on large 3D CT datasets, most NAS-based works use the weight-sharing (WS) strategy to make all models share weights within a supernet; however, WS inevitably incurs search instability, leading to inaccurate model estimation. In this work, we propose an efficient E volutionary M ulti-objective AR chitecture S earch ( EMARS ) framework. We propose a new objective, namely potential , which can help exploit promising models to indirectly reduce the number of models involved in weights training, thus alleviating search instability. We demonstrate that under objectives of accuracy and potential, EMARS can balance exploitation and exploration, i.e., reducing search time and finding better models. Our searched models are small and perform better than prior works on three public COVID-19 3D CT datasets.	
 Necessary Optimality Conditions for Optimal Control Problems in Wasserstein Spaces	Benot Bonnet, Hlne Frankowska	None	None	In this article, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions for a constrained optimal control problem formulated in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. To this end, we introduce a new notion of localised metric subdifferential for compactly supported probability measures, and investigate the intrinsic linearised Cauchy problems associated to non-local continuity equations. In particular, we show that when the velocity perturbations belong to the tangent cone to the convexification of the set of admissible velocities, the solutions of these linearised problems are tangent to the solution set of the corresponding continuity inclusion. We then make use of these novel concepts to provide a synthetic and geometric proof of the celebrated Pontryagin Maximum Principle for an optimal control problem with inequality final-point constraints. In addition, we propose sufficient conditions ensuring the normality of the maximum principle.

 Joint Estimation of Location and Scatter in Complex Elliptical DistributionsThe work of S. Fortunati, A. Renaux and F. Pascal has been partially supported by DGA under grant ANR-17-ASTR-0015.	StefanoFortunati, AlexandreRenaux, FrdricPascal	None	None	The joint estimation of the location vector and the shape matrix of a set of independent and identically Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) distributed observations is investigated from both the theoretical and computational viewpoints. This joint estimation problem is framed in the original context of semiparametric models allowing us to handle the (generally unknown) density generator as an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter. In the first part of the paper, a computationally efficient and memory saving implementation of the robust and semiparmaetric efficient R ùëÖ R italic_R -estimator for shape matrices is derived. Building upon this result, in the second part, a joint estimator, relying on the Tyler‚Äôs M ùëÄ M italic_M -estimator of location and on the R ùëÖ R italic_R -estimator of shape matrix, is proposed and its Mean Squared Error (MSE) performance compared with the Semiparametric Cram√©r-Rao Bound (CSCRB).

The magnetic volume fraction measured with Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº SR increases linearly from 0% to ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 40% with applied magnetic field up to 8 T. This allows us to conclude, in contrast to earlier field-dependent neutron diffraction studies, that the ordered stripe regions are induced by an applied field, and that their ordered magnetic moment is field-independent.	
 The Linkage between the Core Mass and the Magnetic Field of an Extrasolar Giant Planet from Future Radio Observations	Yasunori Hori	None	None	Close-in gas giants are expected to have a strong magnetic field of ‚àº 10 ‚àí 100 similar-to absent 10 100 \sim 10-100 ‚àº 10 - 100 G. Magnetic fields in extrasolar giant planets are detectable by future radio observations in ‚â≥ 10 greater-than-or-equivalent-to absent 10 \gtrsim 10 ‚â≥ 10 MHz and the spectropolarimetry of atomic lines. In contrast, the elusive interiors of exoplanets remain largely unknown. Here we consider the possibility of inferring the existence of the innermost cores of extrasolar giant planets through the detection of planetary magnetic fields. We simulated the long-term thermal evolution of close-in giant planets with masses of 0.2 ‚àí 10 M Jup 0.2 10 subscript ùëÄ Jup 0.2-10\,M_{\mathrm{Jup}} 0.2 - 10 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Jup end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to estimate their magnetic field strengths. A young, massive gas giant tends to have a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field strength of a hot Jupiter is insensitive to its core mass, whereas the core strongly affects the emergence of a planetary dynamo in a hot Saturn. No dynamo-driven magnetic field is generated in a hot Saturn with no core or a small one until ‚àº 10 ‚àí 100 similar-to absent 10 100 \sim 10-100 ‚àº 10 - 100 Myr if metallization of hydrogen occurs at ‚â≥ 1 ‚àí 1.5 greater-than-or-equivalent-to absent 1 1.5 \gtrsim 1-1.5 ‚â≥ 1 - 1.5 Mbar. The magnetic field strength of an evolved gas giant after ‚àº 100 Myr similar-to absent 100 Myr \sim 100\,\mathrm{Myr} ‚àº 100 roman_Myr is almost independent of the stellar incident flux. Detecting the magnetic field of a young, hot Saturn as a good indicator of its core may be challenging because of the weakness of radio signals and the shielding effect of plasma in the Earth‚Äôs ionosphere.

 LEVERAGING 3D INFORMATION IN UNSUPERVISED BRAIN MRI SEGMENTATION			None	Automatic segmentation of brain abnormalities is challenging, as they vary considerably from one pathology to another. Current methods are supervised and require numerous annotated images for each pathology, a strenuous task. To tackle anatomical variability, Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods are proposed, detecting anomalies as outliers of a healthy model learned using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Previous work on UAD adopted a 2D approach, meaning that MRIs are processed as a collection of independent slices. Yet, it does not fully exploit the spatial information contained in MRI. Here, we propose to perform UAD in a 3D fashion and compare 2D and 3D VAEs. As a side contribution, we present a new loss function guarantying a robust training. Learning is performed using a multicentric dataset of healthy brain MRIs, and segmentation performances are estimated on White-Matter Hyperintensities and tumors lesions. Experiments demonstrate the interest of 3D methods which outperform their 2D counterparts.	
 Discrete Adaptive Control Allocation	STohidiMechasnical Engineering DepartmentBilkent UniversityAnkara, TurkeyYYildizMechasnical Engineering DepartmentBilkent UniversityAnkara, Turkey	None	None	The main purpose of a control allocator is to distribute a total control effort among redundant actuators. This paper proposes a discrete adaptive control allocator for over-actuated sampled-data systems in the presence of actuator uncertainty. The proposed method does not require uncertainty estimation or persistency of excitation. Furthermore, the presented algorithm employs a closed loop reference model, which provides fast convergence without introducing excessive oscillations. To generate the total control signal, an LQR controller with reference tracking is used to guarantee the outer loop asymptotic stability.

 A Concise Introduction to Control Theory for Stochastic Partial Differential EquationsThis is a lecture notes of ‚Äúa concise introduction to control theory for stochastic partial differential equations‚Äù. It was written for the EECI (European Embedded Control Institute) Summer School ‚ÄúInternational Graduate School on Control‚Äù at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China from July 8 to July 27, 2019. We refer to the monograph [53] for a more detailed presentation of the whole theory, while the survey paper [56] is mainly for the engineering-oriented readers.	Qi andXu Zhang	None	None	The aim of this notes is to give a concise introduction to control theory for systems governed by stochastic partial differential equations. We shall mainly focus on controllability and optimal control problems for these systems. For the first one, we present results for the exact controllability of stochastic transport equations, null and approximate controllability of stochastic parabolic equations and lack of exact controllability of stochastic hyperbolic equations. For the second one, we first introduce the stochastic linear quadratic optimal control problems and then the Pontryagin type maximum principle for general optimal control problems. It deserves mentioning that, in order to solve some difficult problems in this field, one has to develop new tools, say, the stochastic transposition method introduced in our previous works.	
 Robustness of the international oil trade network under targeted attacks to economies	Na Wei, WenJie Xie, WeiXing Zhou	None	School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China	In the international oil trade network (iOTN), trade shocks triggered by extreme events may spread over the entire network along the trade links of the central economies and even lead to the collapse of the whole system. In this study, we focus on the concept of ‚Äútoo central to fail‚Äù and use traditional centrality indicators as strategic indicators for simulating attacks on economic nodes, and simulates various situations in which the structure and function of the global oil trade network are lost when the economies suffer extreme trade shocks. The simulation results show that the global oil trade system has become more vulnerable in recent years. The regional aggregation of oil trade is an essential source of iOTN‚Äôs vulnerability. Maintaining global oil trade stability and security requires a focus on economies with greater influence within the network module of the iOTN. International organizations such as OPEC and OECD established more trade links around the world, but their influence on the iOTN is declining. We improve the framework of oil security and trade risk assessment based on the topological index of iOTN, and provide a reference for finding methods to maintain network robustness and trade stability.

Together with 51 already covered by the project and an additional 67 in the existing literature, these systems bring the total number of contact binaries with known combined spectroscopic and photometric solutions to 138. It was found that mass, radius and luminosity of the components follow certain relations along the MS and new empirical power relations are extracted. We found that 30 per cent of the systems in the current sample show extreme values in their parameters, expressed in their mass ratio or fill-out factor. This study shows that, among the contact binary systems studied, some have an extremely low mass ratio ( q < 0.1 ùëû 0.1 q<0.1 italic_q < 0.1 ) or an ultra-short orbital period ( P o r b < 0.25 subscript ùëÉ ùëú ùëü ùëè 0.25 P_{orb}<0.25 italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_o italic_r italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0.25 d), which are expected to show evidence of mass transfer progress. The evolutionary status of these components is discussed with the aid of correlation diagrams and their physical and orbital parameters compared to those in the entire sample of known contact binaries. The existence of very short orbital periods confirms the very slow nature of the merging process, which seems to explain why their components still exist as MS stars in contact configurations even after several Gyr of evolution.	
 What‚Äôs in Score for Website Users: A Data-driven Long-term Study on Risk-based Authentication Characteristics	Stephan Wiefling, Markus Drmuth, Luigi Lo Iacono	None	None	Risk-based authentication (RBA) aims to strengthen password-based authentication rather than replacing it. RBA does this by monitoring and recording additional features during the login process. If feature values at login time differ significantly from those observed before, RBA requests an additional proof of identification. Although RBA is recommended in the NIST digital identity guidelines, it has so far been used almost exclusively by major online services. This is partly due to a lack of open knowledge and implementations that would allow any service provider to roll out RBA protection to its users.	
 Revisiting non-Gaussianity in non-attractor inflation models in the light of the cosmological soft theorem	Teruaki Suyama, Yuichiro Tada, Masahide Yamaguchi	None	None	We revisit the squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity in the single-field non-attractor inflation models from the viewpoint of the cosmological soft theorem. In the single-field attractor models, inflaton‚Äôs trajectories with different initial conditions effectively converge into a single trajectory in the phase space, and hence there is only one clock degree of freedom (DoF) in the scalar part. Its long-wavelength perturbations can be absorbed into the local coordinate renormalization and lead to the so-called consistency relation between n ùëõ n italic_n - and ( n + 1 ) ùëõ 1 (n+1) ( italic_n + 1 ) -point functions. On the other hand, if the inflaton dynamics deviates from the attractor behavior, its long-wavelength perturbations cannot necessarily be absorbed and the consistency relation is expected not to hold any longer. In this work, we derive a formula for the squeezed bispectrum including the explicit correction to the consistency relation, as a proof of its violation in the non-attractor cases. First one must recall that non-attractor inflation needs to be followed by attractor inflation in a realistic case. Then, even if a specific non-attractor phase is effectively governed by a single DoF of phase space (represented by the exact ultra-slow-roll limit) and followed by a single-DoF attractor phase, its transition phase necessarily involves two DoF in dynamics and hence its long-wavelength perturbations cannot be absorbed into the local coordinate renormalization. Thus, it can affect local physics, even taking account of the so-called local observer effect , as shown by the fact that the bispectrum in the squeezed limit can go beyond the consistency relation. More concretely, the observed squeezed bispectrum does not vanish in general for long-wavelength perturbations exiting the horizon during a non-attractor phase.

 Subgame-perfect Equilibria in Mean-payoff Games	Lonard Brice, JeanFranois Raskin, Marie van den Bogaard	None	None	In this paper, we provide an effective characterization of all the subgame-perfect equilibria in infinite duration games played on finite graphs with mean-payoff objectives. To this end, we introduce the notion of requirement, and the notion of negotiation function. We establish that the plays that are supported by SPEs are exactly those that are consistent with the least fixed point of the negotiation function. Finally, we show that the negotiation function is piecewise linear, and can be analyzed using the linear algebraic tool box. As a corollary, we prove the decidability of the SPE constrained existence problem, whose status was left open in the literature.	
 Maclaurin‚Äôs series expansions for positive integer powers of inverse (hyperbolic) sine and related functions, specific values of partial Bell polynomials, and two applications	BaiNi Guo, Dongkyu Lim, Feng Qi	bai.ni.guo@gmail.com, bai.ni.guo@hotmail.com	School of Mathematics and Informatics, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo 454010, Henan, China	In the paper, the authors establish Maclaurin‚Äôs series expansions and series identities for positive integer powers of the inverse sine function, for positive integer powers of the inverse hyperbolic sine function, for the composite of incomplete gamma functions with the inverse hyperbolic sine function, for positive integer powers of the inverse tangent function, and for positive integer powers of the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, in terms of the first kind Stirling numbers and binomial coefficients, apply the newly established Maclaurin‚Äôs series expansion for positive integer powers of the inverse sine function to derive a closed-form formula for specific values of partial Bell polynomials and to derive a series representation of the generalized logsine function, and deduce several combinatorial identities involving the first kind Stirling numbers. Some of these results simplify and unify some known ones. All of these newly established Maclaurin‚Äôs series expansions of positive integer powers of the inverse (hyperbolic) sine and tangent functions can be used to derive infinite series representations of the circular constant Pi and of positive integer powers of Pi.

 Signatures of the spatial extent of plastic events in the yielding transition in amorphous solids	Daniel Korchinski, Cline Ruscher, Jrg Rottler	None	None	Amorphous solids are yield stress materials that flow when a sufficient load is applied. Their flow consists of periods of elastic loading interrupted by rapid stress drops, or avalanches, coming from microscopic rearrangements known as shear transformations (STs). Here we show that the spatial extent of avalanches in a steadily sheared amorphous solid has a profound effect on the distribution of local residual stresses x ùë• x italic_x . We find that in this distribution, the most unstable sites are located in a system size dependent plateau. While the entrance into the plateau is set by the lower cutoff of the mechanical noise produced by individual STs, the departure from the usually assumed power-law (pseudogap) form P ( x ) ‚àº x Œ∏ similar-to ùëÉ ùë• superscript ùë• ùúÉ P(x)\sim x^{\theta} italic_P ( italic_x ) ‚àº italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∏ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT comes from far field effects related to spatially extended rearrangements. Interestingly, we observe that the average value of weakest sites ‚ü® x m i n ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùë• ùëö ùëñ ùëõ \langle x_{min}\rangle ‚ü® italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_i italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© is located in an intermediate power law regime between the pseudogap and the plateau regimes, whose exponent decreases with system size. Our findings imply a new scaling relation linking the exponents characterizing the avalanche size and residual stress distributions.	
 A Distributed Implementation of Steady-State Kalman Filter	Jiaqi Yan, Xu Yang, Yilin MostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Keyou You	None	None	This paper studies the distributed state estimation in sensor network, where m ùëö m italic_m sensors are deployed to infer the n ùëõ n italic_n -dimensional state of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Gaussian system. By a lossless decomposition of optimal steady-state Kalman filter, we show that the problem of distributed estimation can be reformulated as the synchronization of homogeneous linear systems. Based on such decomposition, a distributed estimator is proposed, where each sensor node runs a local filter using only its own measurement, alongside with a consensus algorithm to fuse the local estimate of every node. We prove that the average of estimates from all sensors coincides with the optimal Kalman estimate, and under certain condition on the graph Laplacian matrix and the system matrix, the covariance of estimation error is bounded and the asymptotic error covariance is derived. As a result, the distributed estimator is stable for each single node. We further show that the proposed algorithm has a low message complexity of min ‚Å° ( m , n ) ùëö ùëõ \min(m,n) roman_min ( italic_m , italic_n ) . Numerical examples are provided in the end to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	
 Conditional Action and imperfect Erasure of Qubits	HeinzJrgen Schmidt	None	None	"We consider state changes in quantum theory due to ‚Äúconditional action"" and relate these to the discussion of entropy decrease due to interventions of ‚Äúintelligent beings"" and the principles of Szilard and Landauer/Bennett. The mathematical theory of conditional actions is a special case of the theory of ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù which describes changes of state due to general measurements and will therefore be briefly outlined in the present paper. As a detailed example we consider the imperfect erasure of a qubit that can also be viewed as a conditional action and will be realized by the coupling of a spin to another small spin system in its ground state."

 Screening the Higgs portal	Philippe Brax, Clare Burrage	None	None	Light scalar fields that couple to matter through the Higgs portal mediate long range fifth forces. We show how the mixing of a light scalar with the Higgs field can lead to this fifth force being screened around macroscopic objects. This behaviour can only be seen by considering both scalar fields as dynamical, and is missed if the mixing between the Higgs field and the scalar field is not taken into account. We explain under which conditions the naive ‚Äúintegrating out‚Äù procedure fails, i.e. when the mass matrix of the Higgs-scalars system has a nearly vanishing mass eigenvalue. The resulting flat direction in field space can be lifted at the quadratic order in the presence of matter and the resulting fifth force mediated by the Higgs portal can be screened either when the gravitating objects are large enough or their surface Newton potential exceeds a threshold. Finally we discuss the implications of these results for nearly massless relaxion models.	
 Analytical Bounds for Dynamic Multi-Channel Discrimination	Cillian Harney and Stefano Pirandola	None	None	The ability to precisely discriminate multiple quantum channels is fundamental to achieving quantum enhancements in data-readout, target detection, pattern recognition, and more. Optimal discrimination protocols often rely on entanglement shared between an incident probe and a protected idler-mode. While these protocols can be highly advantageous over classical ones, the storage of idler-modes is extremely challenging in practice. In this work, we investigate idler-free block protocols based on the use of multipartite entangled probe states. In particular, we focus on a class of idler-free protocol which uses non-disjoint distributions of multipartite probe states irradiated over multi-channels, known as dynamic discrimination protocols. We derive new, analytical bounds for the average error probability of such protocols in a bosonic Gaussian channel setting, revealing idler-free strategies that display performance close to idler-assistance for powerful, near-term quantum sensing applications.

The common practice is to first evenly divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel A ssociation I mplantation (AI) module to enable the network to explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. The proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary pixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our method could not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but maintain satisfactory inference efficiency.

 Towards a Staging Environment for the Internet of Things	Jossekin Beilharz, Philipp Wiesner, Arne Boockmeyer, Florian Brokhausen,Ilja Behnke, Robert Schmid, Lukas Pirl, and Lauritz Thamsen	None	None	Internet of Things (IoT) applications promise to make many aspects of our lives more efficient and adaptive through the use of distributed sensing and computing nodes. A central aspect of such applications is their complex communication behavior that is heavily influenced by the physical environment of the system. To continuously improve IoT applications, a staging environment is needed that can provide operating conditions representative of deployments in the actual production environments ‚Äì similar to what is common practice in cloud application development today. Towards such a staging environment, we present Marvis , a framework that orchestrates hybrid testbeds, co-simulated domain environments, and a central network simulation for testing distributed IoT applications. Our preliminary results include an open source prototype and a demonstration of a Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication scenario.	
 A fast algorithm for complex discord searches in time series: HOT SAX Time	Paolo Avogadro, Matteo Alessandro Dominoni	None	None	Time series analysis is quickly proceeding towards long and complex tasks. In recent years, fast approximate algorithms for discord search have been proposed in order to compensate for the increasing size of the time series. It is more interesting, however, to find quick exact solutions. In this research, we improved HOT SAX by exploiting two main ideas: the warm-up process, and the similarity between sequences close in time. The resulting algorithm, called HOT SAX Time (HST), has been validated with real and synthetic time series, and successfully compared with HOT SAX, RRA, SCAMP, and DADD. The complexity of a discord search has been evaluated with a new indicator, the cost per sequence ( cps ), which allows one to compare searches on time series of different lengths. Numerical evidence suggests that two conditions are involved in determining the complexity of a discord search in a non-trivial way: the length of the discords, and the noise/signal ratio. In the case of complex searches, HST can be more than 100 times faster than HOT SAX, thus being at the forefront of the exact discord search.	
 Measuring Decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum using Multiple Metrics and Granularities	QinweiLin,ChaoLi,XifengZhao andXianhaiChen	None	None	Decentralization has been widely acknowledged as a core virtue of blockchains. However, in the past, there have been few measurement studies on measuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between existing blockchains using multiple metrics and granularities. This paper presents a new comparison study of the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two most prominent blockchains, with various decentralization metrics and different granularities within the time dimension. Specifically, we measure the degree of decentralization in the two blockchains during 2019 by computing the distribution of mining power with three metrics (Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, and Nakamoto coefficient) as well as three granularities (days, weeks, and months). Our measurement results with different metrics and granularities reveal the same trend that, compared with each other, the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin is higher, while the degree of decentralization in Ethereum is more stable. To obtain the cross-interval information missed in the fixed window based measurements, we propose the sliding window based measurement approach. The corresponding results demonstrate that the use of sliding windows could reveal additional cross-interval information overlooked by the fixed window based measurements, thus enhancing the effectiveness of measuring decentralization in terms of continuous trends and abnormal situations. We believe that the methodologies and findings in this paper can facilitate future studies of decentralization in blockchains.	
 Semi-classical Lindblad master equation for spin dynamics			None	We derive the semi-classical Lindblad master equation in phase space for both canonical and non-canonical Poisson brackets using the Wigner-Moyal formalism and the Moyal star-product. The semi-classical limit for canonical dynamical variables, i. e., canonical Poisson brackets, is the Fokker-Planck equation, as derived before. We generalize this limit and show that it holds also for non-canonical Poisson brackets. Examples are gyro-Poisson brackets, which occur in spin ensembles, systems of recent interest in atomic physics and quantum optics. We show that the equations of motion for the collective spin variables are given by the Bloch equations of nuclear magnetization with relaxation. The Bloch and relaxation vectors are expressed in terms of the microscopic operators: The Hamiltonian and the Lindblad functions in the Wigner-Moyal formalism.

 Privacy-preserving Channel Estimation in Cell-free Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems	JunXu,XiaodongWang,,PengchengZhu, ,andXiaohuYou,	None	None	We consider a cell-free hybrid massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with K ùêæ K italic_K users and M ùëÄ M italic_M access points (APs), each with N a subscript ùëÅ ùëé N_{a} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT antennas and N r < N a subscript ùëÅ ùëü subscript ùëÅ ùëé N_{r}<N_{a} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_a end_POSTSUBSCRIPT radio frequency (RF) chains.

However, such a scheme requires the central processing unit (CPU) to collect received signals from all APs, which may enable the CPU to infer the private information of user locations. We therefore develop and analyze privacy-preserving channel estimation schemes under the framework of differential privacy (DP). As the key ingredient of the channel estimator, two joint differentially private noisy matrix completion algorithms based respectively on Frank-Wolfe iteration and singular value decomposition are presented. We provide an analysis on the tradeoff between the privacy and the channel estimation error. In particular, we show that the estimation error can be mitigated while maintaining the same privacy level by increasing the payload size with fixed pilot size; and the scaling laws of both the privacy-induced and privacy-independent error components in terms of payload size are characterized. Simulation results are provided to further demonstrate the tradeoff between privacy and channel estimation performance.	
 The evolution of network controllability in growing networks	Rui Zhang, Xiaomeng Wang, Ming Cheng, Tao Jia	None	College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, P. R. China	The study of network structural controllability focuses on the minimum number of driver nodes needed to control a whole network. Despite intensive studies on this topic, most of them consider static networks only. It is well-known, however, that real networks are growing, with new nodes and links added to the system. Here, we analyze controllability of evolving networks and propose a general rule for the change of driver nodes. We further apply the rule to solve the problem of network augmentation subject to the controllability constraint. The findings fill a gap in our understanding of network controllability and shed light on controllability of real systems.

 The Pixels and Sounds of Emotion: General-Purpose Representations of Arousal in Games	Konstantinos Makantasis,Antonios Liapis, andGeorgios Yannakakis	None	None	What if emotion could be captured in a general and subject-agnostic fashion? Is it possible, for instance, to design general-purpose representations that detect affect solely from the pixels and audio of a human-computer interaction video? In this paper we address the above questions by evaluating the capacity of deep learned representations to predict affect by relying only on audiovisual information of videos. We assume that the pixels and audio of an interactive session embed the necessary information required to detect affect. We test our hypothesis in the domain of digital games and evaluate the degree to which deep classifiers and deep preference learning algorithms can learn to predict the arousal of players based only on the video footage of their gameplay. Our results from four dissimilar games suggest that general-purpose representations can be built across games as the arousal models obtain average accuracies as high as 85 % percent 85 85\% 85 % using the challenging leave-one-video-out cross-validation scheme. The dissimilar audiovisual characteristics of the tested games showcase the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.

 Few-Shot Semantic Parsing for New Predicates	Zhuang Li, Lizhen Qu , Shuo Huang, Gholamreza HaffariFaculty of Information TechnologyMonash University	None	None	In this work, we investigate the problems of semantic parsing in a few-shot learning setting. In this setting, we are provided with k ùëò k italic_k utterance-logical form pairs per new predicate. The state-of-the-art neural semantic parsers achieve less than 25% accuracy on benchmark datasets when k = 1 ùëò 1 k=1 italic_k = 1 . To tackle this problem, we proposed to i) apply a designated meta-learning method to train the model; ii) regularize attention scores with alignment statistics; iii) apply a smoothing technique in pre-training. As a result, our method consistently outperforms all the baselines in both one and two-shot settings.

In this paper, a novel XAI visual explanation algorithm known as the Similarity Difference and Uniqueness (SIDU) method that can effectively localize entire object regions responsible for prediction is presented in full detail. The SIDU algorithm robustness and effectiveness is analyzed through various computational and human subject experiments. In particular, the SIDU algorithm is assessed using three different types of evaluations (Application, Human and Functionally-Grounded) to demonstrate its superior performance. The robustness of SIDU is further studied in the presence of adversarial attack on ‚Äôblack-box‚Äô models to better understand its performance.

 ALMA reveals a cloud‚Äìcloud collision that triggers star formation in N66N of the Small Magellanic Cloud	NaslimN, Kazuki Tokuda, Susmita Barman, Hiroshi Kondo, Hidetoshi Sano, Toshikazu Onishi	None	None	We present the results of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation in 12 12 {}^{12} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO(1‚Äì0) emission at 0.58 √ó \times √ó 0.52 pc 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT resolution toward the brightest H ii region N66 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The 12 12 {}^{12} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO(1‚Äì0) emission toward the north of N66 reveals the clumpy filaments with multiple velocity components. Our analysis shows that a blueshifted filament at a velocity range 154.4‚Äì158.6 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT interacts with a redshifted filament at a velocity 158.0‚Äì161.8 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT . A third velocity component in a velocity range 161‚Äì165.0 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT constitutes hub-filaments. An intermediate-mass young stellar object (YSO) and a young pre-main sequence star cluster have hitherto been reported in the intersection of these filaments. We find a V-shape distribution in the position-velocity diagram at the intersection of two filaments. This indicates the physical association of those filaments due to a cloud-cloud collision. We determine the collision timescale ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 0.2 Myr using the relative velocity ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 5.1 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ) and displacement ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 1.1 pc) of those interacting filaments. These results suggest that the event occurred at about 0.2 Myr ago and triggered the star formation, possibly an intermediate-mass YSO. We report the first observational evidence for a cloud‚Äìcloud collision that triggers star formation in N66N of the low metallicity ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 0.2 Z ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT galaxy, the SMC, with similar kinematics as in N159W-South and N159E of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

 Relieving the ùêª‚ÇÄ tension with a new interacting dark energy model	LiYang Gao, ZeWei Zhao, SheSheng Xue, Xin Zhang	None	None	We investigate an extended cosmological model motivated by the asymptotic safety of gravitational field theory, in which the matter and radiation densities and the cosmological constant receive a correction parametrized by the parameters Œ¥ G subscript ùõø ùê∫ \delta_{G} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Œ¥ Œõ subscript ùõø Œõ \delta_{\Lambda} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Œõ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , leading to that both the evolutions of the matter and radiation densities and the cosmological constant slightly deviate from the standard forms. Here we explain this model as a scenario of vacuum energy interacting with matter and radiation. We consider two cases of the model: (i) Œõ ~ ~ Œõ {\tilde{\Lambda}} over~ start_ARG roman_Œõ end_ARG CDM with one additional free parameter Œ¥ G subscript ùõø ùê∫ \delta_{G} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , with Œ¥ G subscript ùõø G \delta_{\rm G} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_G end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Œ¥ Œõ subscript ùõø Œõ \delta_{\Lambda} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Œõ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT related by a low-redshift limit relation and (ii) e Œõ ~ ~ Œõ {\tilde{\Lambda}} over~ start_ARG roman_Œõ end_ARG CDM with two additional free parameters Œ¥ G subscript ùõø ùê∫ \delta_{G} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Œ¥ Œõ subscript ùõø Œõ \delta_{\Lambda} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Œõ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that are independent of each other. We use two data combinations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) and CMB+BAO+SN+ H 0 subscript ùêª 0 H_{0} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (CBSH), to constrain the models. We find that, in the case of using the CBS data, neither Œõ ~ ~ Œõ {\tilde{\Lambda}} over~ start_ARG roman_Œõ end_ARG CDM nor e Œõ ~ ~ Œõ {\tilde{\Lambda}} over~ start_ARG roman_Œõ end_ARG CDM can effectively alleviate the H 0 subscript ùêª 0 H_{0} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT tension.

Nonetheless, their development has happened in isolation, while the combination of both could potentially be effective for tackling task-specific labelled data shortage. To bridge this gap, we combine semi-supervised deep generative models and multi-lingual pretraining to form a pipeline for document classification task. Compared to strong supervised learning baselines, our semi-supervised classification framework is highly competitive and outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts in low-resource settings across several languages. 1 1 1 Code is available at https://github.com/cambridgeltl/mling_sdgms .	
 The VLT-MUSE and ALMA view of the MACS 1931.8-2635 brightest cluster galaxy	Ciocan, Ziegler, , Verdugo, , Papaderos, , Fogarty, , Donahue, , Postman, 	None	None	We reveal the importance of ongoing in-situ star formation in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in the massive cool-core CLASH cluster MACS 1931.8-2635 at a redshift of z=0.35 by analysing archival VLT-MUSE optical integral field spectroscopy. Using a multi-wavelength approach, we assess the stellar and warm ionized medium components, spatially resolved by the VLT-MUSE spectroscopy, and link them to the molecular gas by incorporating sub-mm ALMA observations. We measure the fluxes of strong emission lines such as: [ O ii ] Œª 3727 delimited-[] O ii ùúÜ 3727 \rm{[O\textsc{ii}]}\>\lambda 3727 [ roman_O ii ] italic_Œª 3727 , H Œ≤ H ùõΩ \rm{H\beta} roman_H italic_Œ≤ , [ O iii ] Œª 5007 delimited-[] O iii ùúÜ 5007 \rm{[O\textsc{iii}]}\>\lambda 5007 [ roman_O iii ] italic_Œª 5007 , H Œ± H ùõº \rm{H\alpha} roman_H italic_Œ± , [ N ii ] Œª 6584 delimited-[] N ii ùúÜ 6584 \rm{[N\textsc{ii}]}\>\ \lambda 6584 [ roman_N ii ] italic_Œª 6584 and [ S ii ] Œª 6718 , 6732 delimited-[] S ii ùúÜ 6718 6732 \rm{[S\textsc{ii}]}\>\lambda 6718,6732 [ roman_S ii ] italic_Œª 6718 , 6732 , allowing us to determine the physical conditions of the warm ionized gas, such as electron temperature, electron density, extinction, ionization parameter, (O/H) gas metallicities, star formation rates and gas kinematics, as well as the star formation history of the system. Our analysis reveals the ionizing sources in different regions of the galaxy. The ionized gas flux brightness peak corresponds to the location of the supermassive black hole in the BCG and the system shows a diffuse warm ionized gas tail extending 30 kpc in N-E direction. The ionized and molecular gas are co-spatial and co-moving, with the gaseous component in the tail likely falling inward, providing fuel for star formation and accretion-powered nuclear activity. The gas is ionized by a mix of star formation and other energetic processes which give rise to LINER-like emission, with active galactic nuclei emission dominant only in the BCG core. We measure a star formation rate of ‚àº 97 M ‚äô / yr similar-to absent 97 subscript M direct-product yr \sim 97\>\rm{M_{\odot}/yr} ‚àº 97 roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / roman_yr , with its peak at the BCG core. However, star formation accounts for only 50-60% of the energetics needed to ionize the warm gas. In situ star formation generated by thermally unstable intracluster medium cooling and/or dry mergers dominate the stellar mass growth of the BCG at z¬°0.5 and these mechanisms account for the build-up of 20% of the stellar mass of the system. Our measurements reveal that the most central regions of the BCG contain the lowest gas phase oxygen abundance whereas the H Œ± H ùõº \rm{H\alpha} roman_H italic_Œ± arm exhibits slightly more elevated values, suggesting the transport of gas out to large distances from the centre due to active galactic nuclei outbursts. The galaxy is a dispersion dominated system, typical for massive, elliptical galaxies. The gas and stellar kinematics are decoupled, with the gaseous velocity fields being more closely related to the bulk motions of the intracluster medium.	
 Short-term prediction of Time Series based on bounding techniques	Pedro Cadaha, Jos Bravo	pedro.cadahia@alu.uhu.es	Escuela T√©cnica Superior de Ingenier√≠a, Universidad de Huelva,Carretera Huelva - Palos de la Frontera s/n. 21819. La R√°bida - Palos de la Frontera. Huelva. Spain	In this paper it is reconsidered the prediction problem in time series framework by using a new non-parametric approach. Through this reconsideration, the prediction is obtained by a weighted sum of past observed data. These weights are obtained by solving a constrained linear optimization problem that minimizes an outer bound of the prediction error. The innovation is to consider both deterministic and stochastic assumptions in order to obtain the upper bound of the prediction error, a tuning parameter is used to balance these deterministic-stochastic assumptions in order to improve the predictor performance. A benchmark is included to illustrate that the proposed predictor can obtain suitable results in a prediction scheme, and can be an interesting alternative method to the classical non-parametric methods. Besides, it is shown how this model can outperform the preexisting ones in a short term forecast.

 Data sharing games	Vctor Gallego, Roi Naveiro, David Ros Insua, Wolfram Rozas	None	ICMAT-CSIC, Spain	Data sharing issues pervade online social and economic environments. To foster social progress, it is important to develop models of the interaction between data producers and consumers that can promote the rise of cooperation between the involved parties. We formalize this interaction as a game, the data sharing game, based on the Iterated Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma and deal with it through multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques. We consider several strategies for how the citizens may behave, depending on the degree of centralization sought. Simulations suggest mechanisms for cooperation to take place and, thus, achieve maximum social utility: data consumers should perform some kind of opponent modeling, or a regulator should transfer utility between both players and incentivise them.	
 Two-lane totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with extended Langmuir kinetics	Hiroki YamamotostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Shingo IchikistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Daichi Yanagisawa,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Katsuhiro Nishinari,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	h18m1140@hirosaki-u.ac.jp	None	Multi-lane totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes with interactions between the lanes have recently been investigated actively. This paper proposes a two-lane model with extended Langmuir kinetics on a periodic lattice. Both bidirectional and unidirectional flows are investigated. In our model, the hopping, attachment, and detachment rates vary depending on the state of the corresponding site in the other lane. We obtain a theoretical expression for the global density of the system in the steady state from three kinds of mean-field analyses (1-, 2-, and 4-cluster cases). We verify that the 4-cluster mean-field analysis approximates well the results of computer simulations for the two directional flows and reproduces the differences between them. We expect these findings to contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic features of actual traffic systems.

However, keeping track of the constantly changing legislation is difficult, thus organizations are increasingly adopting Regulatory Technology (RegTech) to facilitate the process. To this end, we introduce regulatory information retrieval ( reg-ir ), an application of document-to-document information retrieval ( doc2doc ir ), where the query is an entire document making the task more challenging than traditional ir where the queries are short. Furthermore, we compile and release two datasets based on the relationships between eu directives and uk legislation. We experiment on these datasets using a typical two-step pipeline approach comprising a pre-fetcher and a neural re-ranker. Experimenting with various pre-fetchers from bm 25 25 {}_{25} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 25 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT to k ùëò k italic_k nearest neighbors over representations from several bert models, we show that fine-tuning a bert model on an in-domain classification task produces the best representations for ir . We also show that neural re-rankers under-perform due to contradicting supervision, i.e., similar query-document pairs with opposite labels. Thus, they are biased towards the pre-fetcher‚Äôs score. Interestingly, applying a date filter further improves the performance, showcasing the importance of the time dimension.	
 Liberalized market designs for district heating networks under the EMB3Rs platform	stAntnio Faria, ndTiago Soares, rdJos Maria Cunha, thZenaida Mouro	None	None	Current developments in heat pumps, supported by innovative business models, are driving several industry sectors to take a proactive role in future district heating and cooling networks in cities. For instance, supermarkets and data centers have been assessing the reuse of waste heat as an extra source for the district heating network, which would offset the additional investment in heat pumps. This innovative business model requires complete deregulation of the district heating market to allow industrial heat producers to provide waste heat as an additional source in the district heating network.	
 Signatures of quenching in dwarf galaxies in local galaxy clusters	Joachim Janz, Heikki Salo, Alan Su, , Aku Venhola	None	None	Context: The transformation of late-type galaxies has been suggested as the origin of early-type dwarf galaxies (typically M ‚ãÜ ‚â§ 10 9 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ superscript 10 9 subscript M direct-product M_{\star}\leq 10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â§ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) in galaxy clusters.

 Model-free Data-Driven simulation of inelastic materials using structured data sets, tangent space information and transition rules	, 	Kerem.Ciftci@rub.de	None	Model-free data-driven computational mechanics replaces phenomenological constitutive functions by numerical simulations based on data sets of representative samples in stress-strain space. The distance of strain and stress pairs from the data set is minimized, subject to equilibrium and compatibility constraints. Although this method operates well for non-linear elastic problems, there are challenges dealing with history-dependent materials, since one and the same point in stress-strain space might correspond to different material behaviour. In recent literature, this issue has been treated by including local histories into the data set. However, there is still the necessity to include models for the evolution of specific internal variables. Thus, a mixed formulation of classical and data-driven modeling is obtained. In the presented approach, the data set is augmented with directions in the tangent space of points in stress-strain space. Moreover, the data set is divided into subsets corresponding to different material behaviour. Based on this classification, transition rules map the modeling points to the various subsets. The approach will be applied to non-linear elasticity and elasto-plasticity with isotropic hardening.

 Thermal rectification through a nonlinear quantum resonator	Bibek Bhandari, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Rosario Fazio, Elisabetta Paladino, Fabio Taddei	None	None	We present a comprehensive and systematic study of thermal rectification in a prototypical low-dimensional quantum system ‚Äì a non-linear resonator: we identify necessary conditions to observe thermal rectification and we discuss strategies to maximize it. We focus, in particular, on the case where anharmonicity is very strong and the system reduces to a qubit. In the latter case, we derive general upper bounds on rectification which hold in the weak system-bath coupling regime, and we show how the Lamb shift can be exploited to enhance rectification. We then go beyond the weak-coupling regime by employing different methods: i) including co-tunneling processes, ii) using the non-equilibrium Green‚Äôs function formalism and iii) using the Feynman-Vernon path integral approach. We find that the strong coupling regime allows us to violate the bounds derived in the weak-coupling regime, providing us with clear signatures of high order coherent processes visible in the thermal rectification. In the general case, where many levels participate to the system dynamics, we compare the heat rectification calculated with the equation of motion method and with a mean-field approximation. We find that the former method predicts, for a small or intermediate anharmonicity, a larger rectification coefficient.

We construct galaxy mock catalogues adopting a standard sub-halo abundance matching scheme coupled with a secondary assignment between galaxy colour or specific star formation rate and the following subhalo properties: starvation redshift z starve starve {}_{\rm starve} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT roman_starve end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , concentration at infall, overdensity Œ¥ R env superscript subscript ùõø ùëÖ env \delta_{R}^{\rm env} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_env end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , tidal anisotropy Œ± R subscript ùõº ùëÖ \alpha_{R} italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and tidal overdensity Œ¥ R subscript ùõø ùëÖ \delta_{R} italic_Œ¥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_R end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . The last two quantities allow us to fully characterise the tidal field of our subhaloes, acting as mediators between their internal and large-scale properties. The resulting mock catalogues overall return good agreement with the IllustrisTNG100 measurements. The accuracy of each model strongly depends on the correlation between the secondary galaxy and subhalo properties employed. Among all the subhalo proxies tested, we find that z starve starve {}_{\rm starve} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT roman_starve end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and c infall subscript ùëê infall c_{\rm infall} italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_infall end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the ones that best trace the large-scale structure, producing robust clustering predictions for different samples of red/blue and quenched/star-forming galaxies.	
 Consistent Mesh Colors for Multi-View Reconstructed 3D Scenes			None	We address the issue of creating consistent mesh texture maps captured from scenes without color calibration. We find that the method for aggregation of the multiple views is crucial for creating spatially consistent meshes without the need to explicitly optimize for spatial consistency. We compute a color prior from the cross-correlation of observable view faces and the faces per view to identify an optimal per-face color. We then use this color in a re-weighting ratio for the best-view texture, which is identified by prior mesh texturing work, to create a spatial consistent texture map. Despite our method not explicitly handling spatial consistency, our results show qualitatively more consistent results than other state-of-the-art techniques while being computationally more efficient. We evaluate on prior datasets and additionally Matterport3D showing qualitative improvements.

 Real-time Video Streaming and Control of Cellular-Connected UAV System: Prototype and Performance Evaluation	HuiZhou,Fenghe Hu,MichalJuras,Asish Mehta,and Yansha Deng	None	None	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an increasingly important role in military, public, and civilian applications, where providing connectivity to UAVs is crucial for its real-time control, video streaming, and data collection. Considering that cellular networks offer wide area, high speed, and secure wireless connectivity, cellular-connected UAVs have been considered as an appealing solution to provide UAV connectivity with enhanced reliability, coverage, throughput, and security. Due to the nature of UAVs mobility, the throughput, reliability and End-to-End (E2E) delay of UAVs communication under various flight heights, video resolutions, and transmission frequencies remain unknown. To evaluate these parameters, we develop a cellular-connected UAV testbed based on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network with its uplink video transmission and downlink control&command (CC) transmission. We also design algorithms for sending control signal and controlling UAV. The indoor experimental results provide fundamental insights for the cellular-connected UAV system design from the perspective of transmission frequency, adaptability, and link outage, respectively.	
 Mining the Stars: Learning Quality Ratings with User-facing Explanations for Vacation Rentals	Anastasiia Kornilova, Lucas Bernardi	anastasiia.kornilova@booking.com	None	Online Travel Platforms are virtual two-sided marketplaces where guests search for accommodations and accommodation providers list their properties such as hotels and vacation rentals. The large majority of hotels are rated by official institutions with a number of stars indicating the quality of service they provide. It is a simple and effective mechanism that contributes to match supply with demand by helping guests to find options meeting their criteria and accommodation suppliers to market their product to the right segment directly impacting the number of transactions on the platform. Unfortunately, no similar rating system exists for the large majority of vacation rentals, making it difficult for guests to search and compare options and hard for vacation rentals suppliers to market their product effectively. In this work we describe a machine learned quality rating system for vacation rentals. The problem is challenging, mainly due to explainability requirements and the lack of ground truth. We present techniques to address these challenges and empirical evidence of their efficacy. Our system was successfully deployed and validated through Online Controlled Experiments performed in Booking.com, a large Online Travel Platform, and running for more than one year, impacting more than a million accommodations and millions of guests.

 Dynamic prediction of time to event with survival curves	Jie Zhu, Blanca Gallego	elliott.zhu@unsw.edu.au	"Centre for Big Data Research in Health (CBDRH),
University of New South Wales, Kensington, 2052, NSW, Australia"	With the ever-growing complexity of primary health care system, proactive patient failure management is an effective way to enhancing the availability of health care resource. One key enabler is the dynamic prediction of time-to-event outcomes. Conventional explanatory statistical approach lacks the capability of making precise individual level prediction, while the data adaptive binary predictors does not provide nominal survival curves for biologically plausible survival analysis. The purpose of this article is to elucidate that the knowledge of explanatory survival analysis can significantly enhance the current black-box data adaptive prediction models. We apply our recently developed counterfactual dynamic survival model (CDSM) to static and longitudinal observational data and testify that the inflection point of its estimated individual survival curves provides reliable prediction of the patient failure time.

 A Supernova-driven, Magnetically-collimated Outflow as the Origin of the Galactic Center Radio Bubbles	Mengfei Zhang, Zhiyuan Li, Mark Morris	zmf@nju.edu.cn	None	A pair of non-thermal radio bubbles recently discovered in the inner few hundred parsecs of the Galactic center bears a close spatial association with elongated, thermal X-ray features called the X-ray chimneys. While their morphology, position, and orientation vividly point to an outflow from the Galactic center, the physical processes responsible for the outflow remain to be understood. We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to test the hypothesis that the radio bubbles/X-ray chimneys are the manifestation of an energetic outflow driven by multiple core-collapsed supernovae in the nuclear stellar disk, where numerous massive stars are known to be present. Our simulations are run with different combinations of two main parameters, the supernova birth rate and the strength of a global magnetic field being vertically oriented with respect to the disk. The simulation results show that a hot gas outflow can naturally form and acquire a vertically elongated shape due to collimation by the magnetic pressure. In particular, the simulation with an initial magnetic field strength of 80 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº G and a supernova rate of 1 kyr ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT can well reproduce the observed morphology, internal energy and X-ray luminosity of the bubbles after an evolutionary time of 330 kyr. On the other hand, a magnetic field strength of 200 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº G gives rise to an overly elongated outflow that is inconsistent with the observed bubbles. The simulations also reveal that, inside the bubbles, mutual collisions between the shock waves of individual supernovae produce dense filaments of locally amplified magnetic field. Such filaments may account for a fraction of the synchrotron-emitting radio filaments known to exist in the Galactic center.

 Interference Alignment Using Reaction in Molecular Interference Channels	Maryam FarahnakGhazani, Mahtab Mirmohseni, and Masoumeh NasiriKenari	None	None	Co-channel interference (CCI) is a performance limiting factor in molecular communication (MC) systems with shared medium. Interference alignment (IA) is a promising scheme to mitigate CCI in traditional communication systems. Due to the signal-dependent noise in MC systems, the traditional IA schemes are less useful in MC systems. In this paper, we propose a novel IA scheme in molecular interference channels (IFCs), based on the choice of releasing/sampling times. To cancel the aligned interference signals and reduce the signal dependent noise, we use molecular reaction in the proposed IA scheme. We obtain the feasible region for the releasing/sampling times in the proposed scheme. Further, we investigate the error performance of the proposed scheme. Our results show that the proposed IA scheme using reaction improves the performance significantly. ‚Ä† ‚Ä† This work was supported in part by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) Research Grant on Nano-Network Communications and in part by the Research Center of Sharif University of Technology. ‚Ä† ‚Ä† The authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (email: maryam.farahnak@ee.sharif.edu, mirmohseni@sharif.edu, mnasiri@sharif.edu).	
 The hybrid number of a ploidy profile	Katharina Huber and Liam Maher	K.Huber@uea.ac.uk	"School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia,
Norwich, UK"	Polyploidization, whereby an organism inherits multiple copies of the genome of their parents, is an important evolutionary event that has been observed in plants and animals. One way to study such events is in terms of the ploidy number of the species that make up a dataset of interest. It is therefore natural to ask: How much information about the evolutionary past of the set of species that form a dataset can be gleaned from the ploidy numbers of the species? To help answer this question, we introduce and study the novel concept of a ploidy profile which allows us to formalize it in terms of a multiplicity vector indexed by the species the dataset is comprised of . Using the framework of a phylogenetic network, we present a closed formula for computing the hybrid number (i.e. the minimal number of polyploidization events required to explain a ploidy profile) of a large class of ploidy profiles. This formula relies on the construction of a certain phylogenetic network from the simplification sequence of a ploidy profile and the hybrid number of the ploidy profile with which this construction is initialized. Both of them can be computed easily in case the ploidy numbers that make up the ploidy profile are not too large. To help illustrate the applicability of our approach, we apply it to a simplified version of a publicly available Viola dataset.	
 TOWARDS UNIVERSAL PHYSICAL ATTACKS ON CASCADED CAMERA-LIDAR 3D OBJECT DETECTION MODELS			None	We propose a universal and physically realizable adversarial attack on a cascaded multi-modal deep learning network (DNN), in the context of self-driving cars. DNNs have achieved high performance in 3D object detection, but they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. These attacks have been heavily investigated in the RGB image domain and more recently in the point cloud domain, but rarely in both domains simultaneously - a gap to be filled in this paper. We use a single 3D mesh and differentiable rendering to explore how perturbing the mesh‚Äôs geometry and texture can reduce the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks. We attack a prominent cascaded multi-modal DNN, the Frustum-Pointnet model. Using the popular KITTI benchmark, we showed that the proposed universal multi-modal attack was successful in reducing the model‚Äôs ability to detect a car by nearly 73%. This work can aid in the understanding of what the cascaded RGB-point cloud DNN learns and its vulnerability to adversarial attacks.	
 A probabilistic proof of Cooper&Frieze‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Visit Time Lemma‚Äù	Francesco ManzostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Matteo QuattropanidaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Elisabetta ScoppolastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	manzo.fra@gmail.com	*{}^{*}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT * end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDipartimento di Matematica e Fisca, Universit√† di Roma Tre, Largo San Leonardo Murialdo 1, 00146 Roma, Italy.	In this short note we present an alternative proof of the so-called First Visit Time Lemma (FVTL), originally presented by Cooper and Frieze in its first formulation in [ 21 ] , and then used and refined in a list of papers by Cooper, Frieze and coauthors. We work in the original setting, considering a growing sequence of irreducible Markov chains on n ùëõ n italic_n states. We assume that the chain is rapidly mixing and with a stationary measure having no entry which is too small nor too large. Under these assumptions, the FVTL shows the exponential decay of the distribution of the hitting time of a given state x ùë• x italic_x ‚Äîfor the chain started at stationarity‚Äîup to a small multiplicative correction. While the proof of the FVTL presented by Cooper and Frieze is based on tools from complex analysis, and it requires an additional assumption on a generating function, we present a completely probabilistic proof, relying on the theory of quasi-stationary distributions and on strong-stationary times arguments. In addition, under the same set of assumptions, we provide some quantitative control on the Doob‚Äôs transform of the chain on the complement of the state x ùë• x italic_x .	
 Weak Kaon Production off the nucleon and Watson‚Äôs theorem	SalSala, Sobczyk, Rafi Alam, AlvarezRuso, Nieves	None	None	We have improved the tree-level model of Ref Rafi Alam et al. ( 2010 ) for weak production of kaons off nucleons by partially restoring unitarity. This is achieved by imposing Watson‚Äôs theorem to the dominant vector and axial-vector contributions in appropriate angular momentum and isospin quantum number sectors. The observable consequences of this procedure are investigated.

In spite of the electron-like curvature of the Fermi surface, the Seebeck coefficient is positive at low temperatures. Such a feature, previously observed in copper, silver, gold and lithium, is caused by a non-trivial energy dependence of the scattering time. We argue that this feature implies a strong asymmetry between the lifetime of occupied and unoccupied states along the zone diagonals and such an electron-hole asymmetry impedes formation of Cooper pairs along the nodal direction in the superconducting ground state emerging at lower doping levels.

We perform a simultaneous analysis of the wide upper main sequence and main sequence turn-off observed in the cluster, to verify whether these features are due to an extended star formation or a range of stellar rotation rates, or a combination of these two effects. Comparing the observed CMD with Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic stellar populations, we derive that the morphology of NGC 1831 can be fully explained in the context of the rotation velocity scenario, under the assumption of a bimodal distribution for the rotating stars, with ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 40% of stars being slow-rotators ( Œ© / Œ© crit < 0.5 Œ© subscript Œ© crit 0.5 \Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit}<0.5 roman_Œ© / roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_crit end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 0.5 ) and the remaining ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 60% being fast rotators ( Œ© / Œ© crit > 0.9 Œ© subscript Œ© crit 0.9 \Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit}>0.9 roman_Œ© / roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_crit end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 0.9 ). We derive the dynamical properties of the cluster, calculating the present cluster mass and escape velocity, and predicting their past evolution starting at an age of 10 Myr.

These results, combined with those obtained from the CMD morphology analysis, indicate that for the clusters whose morphology cannot be easily explained only in the context of the rotation velocity scenario, the threshold limit should be at least ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 20 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT .

 Separation of Control and Data Transmissions in 5G Networks may not be Beneficial	Zainab Zaidi, Hazer Inaltekin and Jamie Evans	None	None	The logical separation of control signaling from data transmission in a mobile cellular network has been shown to have significant energy saving potential compared with the legacy systems. As a result, there has been a lot of focus in recent years on development and realization of separation architectures. Our study, however, shows that the energy savings of separation architecture remain under 16 ‚àí 17 % 16 percent 17 16-17\% 16 - 17 % when compared with legacy systems and this gain falls to a mere 7 % percent 7 7\% 7 % when both architectures are realized under a CloudRAN (CRAN) setting. Moreover, when we strategically place some small base-stations (SBSs) to cover the area in a densely deployed scenario and allow all other base-stations (BSs) to be used only on-demand, the system consumes much less energy than the separation architecture. While we expected that most equipment would be shut down during nights, our study shows that around 70 % percent 70 70\% 70 % of the small cells are required to be active to serve randomly distributed minimum data load, i.e., active mobile equipment. Contemporary mobile traffic is predominantly data which does not go to extremely low levels during nights. We discuss, in detail, the assumptions, their implications, and the effects of system parameter values on our conclusions.	
 Forbidding Couples of Tournaments and the Erd√∂s-Hajnal Conjecture			None	A celebrated unresolved conjecture of Erd√∂s and Hajnal states that for every undirected graph H ùêª H italic_H there exists œµ ( H ) > 0 italic-œµ ùêª 0 \epsilon(H)>0 italic_œµ ( italic_H ) > 0 such that every undirected graph on n ùëõ n italic_n vertices that does not contain H ùêª H italic_H as an induced subgraph contains a clique or a stable set of size at least n œµ ( H ) superscript ùëõ italic-œµ ùêª n^{\epsilon(H)} italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œµ ( italic_H ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT .

 Spin-Hall Detector	YuN Chiang, MO DzyubaB Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering,National Academy of Sciences of UkraineNauki Ave , Kharkov , UkraineEmailchiangiltkharkovua	None	None	An oscillographic study of the Hall voltage with an unpolarized alternating current through a platinum sample revealed choral features of the Hall effect, which clearly demonstrate the presence of the spin Hall effect in metals with a noticeable spin-orbit interaction. It was confirmed that, as in the case of direct current, the possibility of a spin-Hall effect is associated with the presence of an imbalance of the spins and charges at the edges of the samples, which is realized using their asymmetric geometry. In particular, it was found that such chiral features of the nonequilibrium spin-Hall effect, such as independence from the direction of the injection current and the direction of the constant magnetic field, in the case of alternating current, make it possible to obtain a double-frequency transverse voltage, which can be used as a platform for creating spintronics devices.

 On the Performance of Spectrum Sharing Backscatter Communication Systems	Yazan AlBadarneh,, Ahmed Elzanaty,, MohamedSlim Alouini	None	None	Spectrum sharing backscatter communication systems are among the most prominent technologies for ultra-low power and spectrum efficient communications. In this paper, we propose an underlay spectrum sharing backscatter communication system, in which the secondary network is a backscatter communication system. We analyze the performance of the secondary network under a transmit power adaption strategy at the secondary transmitter, which guarantees that the interference caused by the secondary network to the primary receiver is below a predetermined threshold. We first derive a novel analytical expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio of the secondary network. Capitalizing on the obtained CDF, we derive novel accurate approximate expressions for the ergodic capacity, effective capacity and average bit error rate. We further validate our theoretical analysis using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.	
 EDGF: Empirical dataset generation framework for wireless network networks	Dinesh Kumar Sah, Praveen Kumar Donta Tarachand Amgoth	None	Department of Computer Science and EngineeringIndian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), DhanbadJharkhand, India-826004dksah.iitd@gmail.com, ‚ÄÜ praveeniitism@gmail.com ‚ÄÜ tarachand.ism@gma	In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), simulation practices, system models, algorithms, and protocols have been published worldwide based on the assumption of randomness. The applied statistics used for randomness in WSNs are broad in nature, e.g., random deployment, activity tracking, packet generation, etc. Even though with adequate formal and informal information provided and pledge by authors, validation of the proposal became a challenging issue. The minuscule information alteration in implementation and validation can reflect the enormous effect on eventual results. In this proposal, we show how the results are affected by the generalized assumption made on randomness. In sensor node deployment, ambiguity arises due to node error-value ( œµ italic-œµ \epsilon italic_œµ ), and it‚Äôs upper bound in the relative position is estimated to understand the delicacy of diminutives changes. Moreover, the effect of uniformity in the traffic and contribution of scheduling position of nodes also generalized. We propose an algorithm to generate the unified dataset for the general and some specific applications system models in WSNs. The results produced by our algorithm reflects the pseudo-randomness and can efficiently regenerate through seed value for validation.	
 Summarising Historical Text in Modern Languages	Xutan PengYi ZhengChenghua LinAdvaith SiddharthanDepartment of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield, UKSchool of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, ChinaKnowledge Media Institute, The OpenUniversity, UK	None	None	We introduce the task of historical text summarisation, where documents in historical forms of a language are summarised in the corresponding modern language. This is a fundamentally important routine to historians and digital humanities researchers but has never been automated. We compile a high-quality gold-standard text summarisation dataset, which consists of historical German and Chinese news from hundreds of years ago summarised in modern German or Chinese. Based on cross-lingual transfer learning techniques, we propose a summarisation model that can be trained even with no cross-lingual (historical to modern) parallel data, and further benchmark it against state-of-the-art algorithms. We report automatic and human evaluations that distinguish the historic to modern language summarisation task from standard cross-lingual summarisation (i.e., modern to modern language), highlight the distinctness and value of our dataset, and demonstrate that our transfer learning approach outperforms standard cross-lingual benchmarks on this task.	
 Learning Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Pixel Aggregations for Image and Video Denoising	Xiangyu Xu, Muchen Li, Wenxiu Sun, MingHsuan Yang	None	None	Existing denoising methods typically restore clear results by aggregating pixels from the noisy input. Instead of relying on hand-crafted aggregation schemes, we propose to explicitly learn this process with deep neural networks. We present a spatial pixel aggregation network and learn the pixel sampling and averaging strategies for image denoising. The proposed model naturally adapts to image structures and can effectively improve the denoised results. Furthermore, we develop a spatio-temporal pixel aggregation network for video denoising to efficiently sample pixels across the spatio-temporal space. Our method is able to solve the misalignment issues caused by large motion in dynamic scenes. In addition, we introduce a new regularization term for effectively training the proposed video denoising model. We present extensive analysis of the proposed method and demonstrate that our model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and video denoising approaches on both synthetic and real-world data.	
 An Efficient Statistical-based Gradient Compression Technique for Distributed Training Systems			None	The recent many-fold increase in the size of deep neural networks makes efficient distributed training challenging. Many proposals exploit the compressibility of the gradients and propose lossy compression techniques to speed up the communication stage of distributed training. Nevertheless, compression comes at the cost of reduced model quality and extra computation overhead. In this work, we design an efficient compressor with minimal overhead. Noting the sparsity of the gradients, we propose to model the gradients as random variables distributed according to some sparsity-inducing distributions . We empirically validate our assumption by studying the statistical characteristics of the evolution of gradient vectors over the training process. We then propose Sparsity-Inducing Distribution-based Compression ( SIDCo ) ‚Äã, a threshold-based sparsification scheme that enjoys similar threshold estimation quality to deep gradient compression ( DGC ) while being faster by imposing lower compression overhead. Our extensive evaluation of popular machine learning benchmarks involving both recurrent neural network ( RNN ) and convolution neural network ( CNN ) models shows that SIDCo ‚Äã speeds up training by up to ‚âà 41.7 √ó \approx\!41.7\times ‚âà 41.7 √ó , 7.6 √ó 7.6\times 7.6 √ó , and 1.9 √ó 1.9\times 1.9 √ó compared to the no-compression baseline, Top k subscript Top ùëò {\text{Top}_{k}} Top start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and DGC compressors, respectively.

 Benchmarking Invertible Architectures on Inverse Problems	Jakob Kruse, Lynton Ardizzone, Carsten Rother, Ullrich Kthe	None	None	Recent work demonstrated that flow-based invertible neural networks are promising tools for solving ambiguous inverse problems. Following up on this, we investigate how ten invertible architectures and related models fare on two intuitive, low-dimensional benchmark problems, obtaining the best results with coupling layers and simple autoencoders. We hope that our initial efforts inspire other researchers to evaluate their invertible architectures in the same setting and put forth additional benchmarks, so our evaluation may eventually grow into an official community challenge.

 Automatic Detection of Causality in Requirement Artifacts: the CiRA Approach	Jannik Fischbach, Julian Frattini, Arjen Spaans, Maximilian Kummeth, Andreas Vogelsang, Daniel Mendez, Michael Unterkalmsteiner	None	None	[ Context & motivation: ] System behavior is often expressed by causal relations in requirements (e.g., If event 1, then event 2 ). Automatically extracting this embedded causal knowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also various automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases. However, causality extraction from natural language (NL) is still an open research challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable performance. [ Question/problem: ] We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two-step problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or not. Second, we need to understand and extract their causal relations. At present, though, we lack knowledge about the form and complexity of causality in requirements, which is necessary to develop a suitable approach addressing these two problems. [ Principal ideas/results: ] We conduct an exploratory case study with 14,983 sentences from 53 requirements documents originating from 18 different domains and shed light on the form and complexity of causality in requirements. Based on our findings, we develop a tool-supported approach for causality detection (CiRA, standing for Causality in Requirement Artifacts). This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL requirements. [ Contribution: ] We report on a case study and the resulting tool-supported approach for causality detection in requirements. Our case study corroborates, among other things, that causality is, in fact, a widely used linguistic pattern to describe system behavior, as about a third of the analyzed sentences are causal. We further demonstrate that our tool CiRA achieves a macro-F 1 score of 82 % on real word data and that it outperforms related approaches with an average gain of 11.06 % in macro-Recall and 11.43 % in macro-Precision. Finally, we disclose our open data sets as well as our tool to foster the discourse on the automatic detection of causality in the RE community.	
 A broadband view on microquasar MAXI J1820+070 during the 2018 outburst	Rodi, Tramacere, Onori, Bruni, SnchezFernndez, Fiocchi, Natalucci, Ubertini	None	None	The microquasar MAXI J 1820 + 070 1820 070 1820+070 1820 + 070 went into outburst from mid-March until mid-July 2018 with several faint rebrightenings afterwards. With a peak flux of approximately 4 Crab in the 20 ‚àí 50 20 50 20-50 20 - 50 keV, energy range the source was monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum with detections from radio to hard X-ray frequencies. Using these multi-wavelength observations, we analyzed quasi-simultaneous observations from 12 April, near the peak of the outburst ( ‚àº 23 similar-to absent 23 \sim 23 ‚àº 23 March). Spectral analysis of the hard X-rays found a k T e ‚àº 30 similar-to ùëò subscript ùëá ùëí 30 kT_{e}\sim 30 italic_k italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àº 30 keV and œÑ ‚àº 2 similar-to ùúè 2 \tau\sim 2 italic_œÑ ‚àº 2 with a CompTT model, indicative of an accreting black hole binary in the hard state. The flat/inverted radio spectrum and the accretion disk winds seen at optical wavelengths are also consistent with the hard state. Then we constructed a spectral energy distribution spanning ‚àº 12 similar-to absent 12 \sim 12 ‚àº 12 orders of magnitude using modelling in JetSeT . The model is composed of an irradiated disk with a Compton hump and a leptonic jet with an acceleration region and a synchrotron-dominated cooling region. JetSeT finds the spectrum is dominated by jet emission up to approximately 10 14 superscript 10 14 10^{14} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT Hz after which disk and coronal emission dominate. The acceleration region has a magnetic field of B ‚àº 1.6 √ó 10 4 similar-to ùêµ 1.6 superscript 10 4 B\sim 1.6\times 10^{4} italic_B ‚àº 1.6 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT G, a cross section of R ‚àº 2.8 √ó 10 9 similar-to ùëÖ 2.8 superscript 10 9 R\sim 2.8\times 10^{9} italic_R ‚àº 2.8 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm, and a flat radio spectral shape naturally obtained from the synchroton cooling of the accelerated electrons. The jet luminosity of > 8 √ó 10 37 absent 8 superscript 10 37 >8\times 10^{37} > 8 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 37 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT erg/s ( > 0.15 L E d d absent 0.15 subscript ùêø ùê∏ ùëë ùëë >0.15L_{Edd} > 0.15 italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_E italic_d italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) compared to an accretion luminosity of ‚àº 6 √ó 10 37 similar-to absent 6 superscript 10 37 \sim 6\times 10^{37} ‚àº 6 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 37 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT erg/s, assuming a distance of 3 kpc. Because these two values are comparable, it is possible the jet is powered predominately via accretion with only a small contribution needed from the Blanford-Znajek mechanism from the reportedly slowly spinning black hole.	
 Cryogenic thermo-acoustic oscillations highlight and study in the SPIRAL2 superconducting LINAC	Adnan Ghribi, Muhammad Aburas, Yoann Baumont, PierreEmmanuel Bernaudin, Stphane Bonneau, JeanFranois Leyge, Guillaume Lescali, JeanPierre Thermeau, Yann Thivel, Laurent Valentin, Adrien Vassal	ghribi@in2p3.fr	None	Cryogenic thermoacoustic oscillations is an area of interest of several studies. For superconducting accelerators, it is an unwanted phenomena that we usually want to get rid off. The SPIRAL2 superconducting accelerator had distributed Taconis all over its cryostats. This paper spans the different steps from their first detection to their damping with a highlight on the methods and the instrumentation that has been used. The presented study also sets the ground for a real life experimental investigation of thermo-ascoustics in complex geometries such as superconducting LINACs. With modern Big data analysis and simulation tools, it also sets the ground for the developments of new data linked codes that fit these complex situations.

 New fixed-circle results related to ùêπ_ùëê-contractive and ùêπ_ùëê-expanding mappings on metric spaces	Nabil MLAIKIstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, NHAL ZGRstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand NHAL TAstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	nmlaiki@psu.edu.sa; nmlaiki2012@gmail.com	"11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Mathematics and General Sciences, Prince Sultan
University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."	The fixed-circle problem is a recent problem about the study of geometric properties of the fixed point set of a self-mapping on metric (resp. generalized metric) spaces. The fixed-disc problem occurs as a natural consequence of this problem. Our aim in this paper, is to investigate new classes of self-mappings which satisfy new specific type of contraction on a metric space. We see that the fixed point set of any member of these classes contains a circle (or a disc) called the fixed circle (resp. fixed disc) of the corresponding self-mapping. For this purpose, we introduce the notions of an F c subscript ùêπ ùëê F_{c} italic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -contractive mapping and an F c subscript ùêπ ùëê F_{c} italic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -expanding mapping. Activation functions with fixed circles (resp. fixed discs) are often seen in the study of neural networks. This shows the effectiveness of our fixed-circle (resp. fixed-disc) results. In this context, our theoretical results contribute to future studies on neural networks.

 LIGHTS: LIGHT Specularity Dataset for specular detection in Multi-view			None	Specular highlights are commonplace in images, however, methods for detecting them and in turn removing the phenomenon are particularly challenging. A reason for this, is due to the difficulty of creating a dataset for training or evaluation, as in the real-world we lack the necessary control over the environment. Therefore, we propose a novel physically-based rendered LIGHT Specularity (LIGHTS) Dataset for the evaluation of the specular highlight detection task. Our dataset consists of 18 18 18 18 high quality architectural scenes, where each scene is rendered with multiple views.

 Data-driven design of a new class of rare-earth free permanent magnets	Alena Vishina, Daniel Hedlund, Vitalii Shtender, Erna DelczegCzirjak, Simon Larsen, Olga Yu Vekilova, Shuo Huang, Levente Vitos, Peter Svedlindh, Martin Sahlberg, Olle Eriksson, Heike Herper	alena.vishina@physics.uu.se	None	A new class of rare-earth-free permanent magnets is proposed. The parent compound of this class is Co 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Mn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Ge, and its discovery is the result of first principles theory combined with experimental synthesis and characterisation. The theory is based on a high-throughput/data-mining search among materials listed in the ICSD database. From ab-initio theory of the defect free material it is predicted that the saturation magnetization is 1.71 T, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 1.44 MJ/m 3 3 {}^{3} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT , and the Curie temperature is 700 K. Co 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Mn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Ge samples were then synthesized and characterised with respect to structure and magnetism. The crystal structure was found to be the MgZn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT -type, with partial disorder of Co and Ge on the crystallographic lattice sites. From magnetization measurements a saturation polarization of 0.86 T at 10 K was detected, together with a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of 1.18 MJ/m 3 3 {}^{3} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT , and the Curie temperature of T C subscript ùëá C T_{\rm C} italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_C end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 359 K. These magnetic properties make Co 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Mn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Ge a very promising material as a rare-earth free permanent magnet, and since we can demonstrate that magnetism depends critically on the amount of disorder of the Co and Ge atoms, a further improvement of the magnetism is possible. From the theoretical works, a substitution of Ge by neighboring elements suggest two other promising materials - Co 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Mn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Al and Co 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Mn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Ga. We demonstrate here that the class of compounds based on T 3 subscript ùëá 3 T_{3} italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT Mn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT X (T = Co or alloys between Fe and Ni; X=Ge, Al or Ga) in the MgZn 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT structure type, form a new class of rare-earth free permanent magnets with very promising performance.	
 Lightweight Multi-Branch Network for Person Re-Identification			None	Person Re-Identification aims to retrieve person identities from images captured by multiple cameras or the same cameras in different time instances and locations. Because of its importance in many vision applications from surveillance to human-machine interaction, person re-identification methods need to be reliable and fast. While more and more deep architectures are proposed for increasing performance, those methods also increase overall model complexity. This paper proposes a lightweight network that combines global, part-based, and channel features in a unified multi-branch architecture that builds on the resource-efficient OSNet backbone. Using a well-founded combination of training techniques and design choices, our final model achieves state-of-the-art results on CUHK03 labeled, CUHK03 detected, and Market-1501 with 85.1% mAP / 87.2% rank1, 82.4% mAP / 84.9% rank1, and 91.5% mAP / 96.3% rank1, respectively.

With the rotation of the cameras we overcome the limitations of standard static systems that restrict the duration of the collected data to the short interval of time in which targets are in the cameras common field of view, but at the same time we change in time the external parameters of the system, which have then to be calibrated frame-by-frame. We address the calibration of the external parameters measuring the position of the cameras and their three angles of yaw, pitch and roll in the system home configuration (rotational stage at an angle equal to 0 ¬∞ 0 ¬∞ 0\degree 0 ¬∞ ) and combining this static information with the time dependent rotation due to the stages. We evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the system by comparing reconstructed and measured 3 D 3 ùê∑ 3D 3 italic_D distances in what we call 3 D 3 ùê∑ 3D 3 italic_D tests, which show a relative error of the order of 1 % percent 1 1\% 1 % . The novelty of the work presented in this paper is not only on the system itself, but also on the approach we use in the tests, which we show to be a very powerful tool in detecting and fixing calibration inaccuracies and that, for this reason, may be relevant for a broad audience.	
 The radiative efficiency of neutron stars at low-level accretion	Erlin Qiao,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand BF Liu,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTKey Laboratory of Space Astronomy and Technology, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy ofSciences, Beijing , ChinastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSchool of Astronomy andSpace Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road, Beijing , China	None	None	When neutrons star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs) are in the low-level accretion regime (i.e., L X ‚â≤ 10 36 erg s ‚àí 1 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùêø X superscript 10 36 erg superscript s 1 L_{\rm X}\lesssim 10^{36}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_X end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 36 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_erg roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), the accretion flow in the inner region around the NS is expected to be existed in the form of the hot accretion flow, e.g., the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) as that in black hole X-ray binaries. Following our previous studies in Qiao & Liu 2020a and 2020b on the ADAF accretion around NSs, in this paper, we investigate the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF accretion in detail, showing that the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF accretion is much lower than that of œµ ‚àº M Àô G M R * / M Àô c 2 ‚àº 0.2 similar-to italic-œµ Àô ùëÄ ùê∫ ùëÄ subscript ùëÖ Àô ùëÄ superscript ùëê 2 similar-to 0.2 \epsilon\sim{\dot{M}GM\over R_{*}}/{\dot{M}c^{2}}\sim 0.2 italic_œµ ‚àº divide start_ARG overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG italic_G italic_M end_ARG start_ARG italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT * end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG / overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àº 0.2 despite the existence of the hard surface.

Finally, we discuss that if applicable, the model of ADAF accretion around a NS can be applied to explain the observed millisecond X-ray pulsation in some NS-LMXBs (such as PSR J1023+0038, XSS J12270-4859 and IGR J17379-3747) at a lower X-ray luminosity of a few times of 10 33 erg s ‚àí 1 superscript 10 33 erg superscript s 1 10^{33}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 33 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_erg roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , since at this X-ray luminosity the calculated M Àô Àô ùëÄ \dot{M} overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG with the model of ADAF accretion can be high enough to drive a fraction of the matter in the accretion flow to be channelled onto the surface of the NS forming the X-ray pulsation.	
 Joint Forecasting of Features and Feature Motion for Dense Semantic Future PredictionThis work has been funded by Rimac Automobili.

Josip ari, Sacha Vrai, Sinia egvi, Josip ari, Sacha Vrai, Sinia egvi	None	None	Dense semantic forecasting anticipates future events in video by inferring pixel-level semantics of an unobserved future image. We present a novel approach that is applicable to various single-frame architectures and tasks. Our approach consists of two modules. Feature-to-motion (F2M) module forecasts a dense deformation field that warps past features into their future positions. Feature-to-feature (F2F) module regresses the future features directly and is therefore able to account for emergent scenery. The compound F2MF model decouples the effects of motion from the effects of novelty in a task-agnostic manner. We aim to apply F2MF forecasting to the most subsampled and the most abstract representation of a desired single-frame model. Our design takes advantage of deformable convolutions and spatial correlation coefficients across neighbouring time instants. We perform experiments on three dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation, instance-level segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. The results reveal state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across three dense prediction tasks.	
 Measurement-device-independent entanglement detection for continuous-variable systems	Paolo Abiuso, Stefan Buml, Daniel Cavalcanti, Antonio Acn	paolo.abiuso@icfo.eu	None	We study the detection of continuous-variable entanglement, for which most of the existing methods designed so far require a full specification of the devices, and we present protocols for entanglement detection in a scenario where the measurement devices are completely uncharacterised. We first generalise, to the continuous variable regime, the seminal results by Buscemi [PRL 108, 200401 (2012)] and Branciard et al. [PRL 110, 060405 (2013)], showing that all entangled states can be detected in this scenario. Most importantly, we then describe a practical protocol that allows for the measurement-device-independent certification of entanglement of all two-mode entangled Gaussian states. This protocol is feasible with current technology as it makes only use of standard optical setups such as coherent states and homodyne measurements.

Most of our understanding and modeling of such systems are based upon macroscopic theories, wherein the atoms are treated as a smooth, quantum polarizable medium. Although it is known that such approaches ignore a number of microscopic details, such as the granularity of atoms, dipole-dipole interactions and multiple scattering of light, the consequences of such effects in practical settings are usually mixed with background macroscopic effects and difficult to quantify. In this work we demonstrate a time-domain method to measure microscopically-driven optical effects in a background-free fashion, by transiently suppressing the macroscopic dynamics. With the method, we reveal a microscopic dipolar dephasing mechanism that generally limits the lifetime of the optical spin-wave order in a random gas. Theoretically, we show the dephasing effect emerges from the strong resonant dipole interaction between close-by atomic pairs.

 The primary proton spectrum of the hadronic PeVatron candidate HAWC J1825-134	Timur Dzhatdoev, Egor Podlesnyi, Igor Vaiman	None	None	The Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray spectrum of the source HAWC J1825-134 measured with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory extends beyond 200 TeV without any evidence for a steepening or cutoff. There are some indications that the Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -rays detected with HAWC were produced by cosmic ray protons or nuclei colliding with the ambient gas. Assuming primary protons, we inquire which shape of the primary proton spectrum is compatible with the HAWC measurements. We find that the primary proton spectrum with the power-law shape of Œ≥ p = 2.2 subscript ùõæ ùëù 2.2 \gamma_{p}=2.2 italic_Œ≥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2.2 and the cutoff energy E c ‚àí p > 500 subscript ùê∏ ùëê ùëù 500 E_{c-p}>500 italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c - italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 500 TeV describes the data well. However, much harder spectra with Œ≥ p subscript ùõæ ùëù \gamma_{p} italic_Œ≥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT down to 1.3 and E c ‚àí p subscript ùê∏ ùëê ùëù E_{c-p} italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c - italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as low as 200 TeV also do not contradict the HAWC measurements. The former option might be realized if the accelerator is inside or very near to the Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray production zone. The latter option is viable for the case of a cosmic ray source which effectively confines low-energy ( E p < 10 subscript ùê∏ ùëù 10 E_{p}<10 italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 10 TeV) accelerated protons. Using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray telescope, we derive upper limits on the intensity of the HAWC J1825-134 (catalog ) source in the 1 GeV ‚Äì 1 TeV energy range. We show that the account of these upper limits drastically changes the interpretation: only hard ( Œ≥ p < 1.7 subscript ùõæ ùëù 1.7 \gamma_{p}<1.7 italic_Œ≥ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 1.7 ) spectra describe the combined HAWC and Fermi-LAT datasets well.	
 A Behavioural Analysis of Credulous Twitter Users	Alessandro Balestrucci, Rocco De Nicola, Marinella Petrocchi, Catia Trubiani	a.balestrucci@gssi.it	Gran Sasso Science Institute, via M. Iacobucci 2, 67100 L‚ÄôAquila, Italy	Thanks to platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, people can know facts and events that otherwise would have been silenced. However, social media significantly contribute also to fast spreading biased and false news while targeting specific segments of the population. We have seen how false information can be spread using automated accounts, known as bots. Using Twitter as a benchmark, we investigate behavioural attitudes of so called ‚Äòcredulous‚Äô users, i.e., genuine accounts following many bots. Leveraging our previous work, where supervised learning is successfully applied to single out credulous users, we improve the classification task with a detailed features‚Äô analysis and provide evidence that simple and lightweight features are crucial to detect such users. Furthermore, we study the differences in the way credulous and not credulous users interact with bots and discover that credulous users tend to amplify more the content posted by bots and argue that their detection can be instrumental to get useful information on possible dissemination of spam content, propaganda, and, in general, little or no reliable information.	
 A simple low-degree optimal finite element scheme for the elastic transmission eigenvalue problem	Yingxia Xi, Xia Ji, Shuo Zhang	xiyingxia@njust.edu.cn	School of Science, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing 210094, China.	The paper presents a finite element scheme for the elastic transmission eigenvalue problem written as a fourth order eigenvalue problem. The scheme uses piecewise cubic polynomials and obtains optimal convergence rate. Compared with other low-degree and nonconforming finite element schemes, the scheme inherits the continuous bilinear form which does not need extra stabilizations and is thus simple to implement.

AmrAlanwar,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, AlexanderBerndt,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, KarlHenrikJohanssonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and HenrikSandbergstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We propose a method to perform set-based state estimation of an unknown dynamical linear system using a data-driven set propagation function. Our method comes with set-containment guarantees, making it applicable to safety-critical systems. The method consists of two phases: (1) an offline learning phase where we collect noisy input-output data to determine a function to propagate the state-set ahead in time; and (2) an online estimation phase consisting of a time update and a measurement update. It is assumed that known finite sets bound measurement noise and disturbances, but we assume no knowledge of their statistical properties. These sets are described using zonotopes, allowing efficient propagation and intersection operations. We propose a new approach to compute a set of models consistent with the data and noise-bound, given input-output data in the offline phase. The set of models is utilized in replacing the unknown dynamics in the data-driven set propagation function in the online phase. Then, we propose two approaches to perform the measurement update. Simulations show that the proposed estimator yields state sets comparable in volume to the 3 œÉ 3 ùúé 3\sigma 3 italic_œÉ confidence bounds obtained by a Kalman filter approach, but with the addition of state set-containment guarantees. We observe that using constrained zonotopes yields smaller sets but with higher computational costs than unconstrained ones.

The software is fully modular to support adaption to different video conference software, programming languages and implementations.	
 Hydrodynamical study of Terahertz emission in magnetized graphene field-effect transistors	Pedro Cosme, Hugo Teras	pedro.cosme.e.silva@tecnico.ulisboa.pt	None	Several hydrodynamic descriptions of charge transport in graphene have been presented in the late years. We discuss a general hydrodynamic model governing the dynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas in a magnetized field-effect transistor in the slow drift regime. The Dyakonov‚ÄìShur instability is investigated, including the effect of weak magnetic fields (i.e. away from Landau levels). We show that the gap on the dispersion relation prevents the instability from reaching the lower frequencies, thus imposing a limit on the Mach number of the electronic flow. Furthermore, we discuss that the presence of the external magnetic field decreases the growth rate of the instability, as well as the saturation amplitude. The numerical results from our simulations and the presented higher order dynamic mode decomposition support such reasoning.	
 Minimal Spacelike Surfaces and the Graphic Equations in ‚Ñù‚ÇÅ‚Å¥	Dussan, Franco Filho, Santos	None	None	In this paper we study an extension of the Bernstein Theorem for minimal spacelike surfaces of the four dimensional Minkowski vector space form and we obtain the class of those surfaces which are also graphics and have non-zero Gauss curvature. That is the class of entire solutions of a system of two elliptic non-linear equations that is an extension of the equation of minimal graphic of ‚Ñù 3 superscript ‚Ñù 3 \mathbb{R}^{3} blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Therefore, we prove that the so-called Bernstein property does not hold in general for the case of graphic spacelike surfaces in ‚Ñù 1 4 subscript superscript ‚Ñù 4 1 \mathbb{R}^{4}_{1} blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .

 Floquet phonon lasing in multimode optomechanical systems	Laura Mercad, Karl Pelka, Roel Burgwal, Andr Xuereb, Alejandro Martnez, Ewold Verhagen	None	None	Dynamical radiation pressure effects in cavity optomechanical systems give rise to self-sustained oscillations or ‚Äòphonon lasing‚Äô behavior, producing stable oscillators up to GHz frequencies in nanoscale devices. Like in photonic lasers, phonon lasing normally occurs in a single mechanical mode. We show here that phase-locked, multimode phonon lasing can be established in a multimode optomechanical system through Floquet dynamics induced by a temporally modulated laser drive. We demonstrate this concept in a suitably engineered silicon photonic nanocavity coupled to multiple GHz-frequency mechanical modes. We find that the long-term frequency stability is significantly improved in the multimode lasing state as a result of the phase locking. These results provide a path towards highly stable ultra-compact oscillators, pulsed phonon lasing, coherent waveform synthesis, and emergent many-mode phenomena in oscillator arrays.

Customer satisfaction with airlines and airport performance is considerably influenced by how much flights are delayed. But how should the delay be quantified with thousands of flights for each airport and airline? Here, we present a statistical analysis of arrival delays at several UK airports between 2018 and 2020. We establish a procedure to compare both mean delay and extreme events among airlines and airports, identifying a power-law decay of large delays. Furthermore, we note drastic changes in plane delay statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we find that delays are described by a superposition of simple distributions, leading to a superstatistics.

 Adversarial Vulnerability of Active Transfer Learning	Nicolas Mller, Konstantin Bttinger	None	None	Two widely used techniques for training supervised machine learning models on small datasets are Active Learning and Transfer Learning. The former helps to optimally use a limited budget to label new data. The latter uses large pre-trained models as feature extractors and enables the design of complex, non-linear models even on tiny datasets. Combining these two approaches is an effective, state-of-the-art method when dealing with small datasets.

When a superconductor exchanges unpaired electrons with a quantum dot, its gap is populated by a pair of electron-hole symmetric Yu-Shiba-Rusinov excitations between doublet and singlet many-body states. The fate of these excitations in the presence of a strong Coulomb repulsion in the superconductor is unknown, but of importance in applications such as topological superconducting qubits and multi-channel impurity models. Here we couple a quantum dot to a superconducting island with a tunable Coulomb repulsion. We show that a strong Coulomb repulsion changes the singlet many-body state into a two-body state. It also breaks the electron-hole energy symmetry of the excitations, which thereby lose their Yu-Shiba-Rusinov character.

Recent research highlighted that useful forensic traces are also left in the video container structure, thus offering the opportunity to understand the life-cycle of a video file without looking at the media stream itself.

For a Grothendieck abelian category ùñ† ùñ† \mathsf{A} sansserif_A , we construct the injective derived and coderived model structures on complexes. Assuming Vopƒõnka‚Äôs principle, we prove that the derived category ùñ£ ( ùñ† ) ùñ£ ùñ† \mathsf{D}(\mathsf{A}) sansserif_D ( sansserif_A ) is generated, as a triangulated category with products, by the injective cogenerator of ùñ† ùñ† \mathsf{A} sansserif_A . More generally, we define the notion of an exact category with an object size function and prove that the derived category of any such exact category with exact Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ -directed colimits of chains of admissible monomorphisms has Hom sets. In particular, the derived category of any locally presentable abelian category has Hom sets.	
 Mirror Chern numbers in the hybrid Wannier representation	Tom Rauch, Thomas Olsen, David Vanderbilt, Ivo Souza	None	None	The topology of electronic states in band insulators with mirror symmetry can be classified in two different ways. One is in terms of the mirror Chern number, an integer that counts the number of protected Dirac cones in the Brillouin zone of high-symmetry surfaces. The other is via a ‚Ñ§ 2 subscript ‚Ñ§ 2 \mathbbm{Z}_{2} blackboard_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT index that distinguishes between systems that have a nonzero quantized orbital magnetoelectric coupling (‚Äúaxion-odd‚Äù), and those that do not (‚Äúaxion-even‚Äù); this classification can also be induced by other symmetries in the magnetic point group, including time reversal and inversion. A systematic characterization of the axion ‚Ñ§ 2 subscript ‚Ñ§ 2 \mathbbm{Z}_{2} blackboard_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT topology has previously been obtained by representing the valence states in terms of hybrid Wannier functions localized along one chosen crystallographic direction, and inspecting the associated Wannier band structure. Here we focus on mirror symmetry, and extend that characterization to the mirror Chern number. We choose the direction orthogonal to the mirror plane as the Wannierization direction, and show that the mirror Chern number can be determined from the winding numbers of the touching points between Wannier bands on mirror-invariant planes, and from the Chern numbers of flat bands pinned to those planes.

 ImageCHD: A 3D Computed Tomography Image Dataset for Classification of Congenital Heart Disease	Xiaowei Xu, Tianchen Wang, Jian Zhuang, Haiyun Yuan, Meiping Huang, Jianzheng Cen, Qianjun Jia, Yuhao Dong, Yiyu Shi	None	None	Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defects, which occurs 1 in every 110 births in the United States. CHD usually comes with severe variations in heart structure and great artery connections that can be classified into many types. Thus highly specialized domain knowledge and time-consuming human process is needed to analyze the associated medical images. On the other hand, due to the complexity of CHD and the lack of dataset, little has been explored on the automatic diagnosis (classification) of CHDs. In this paper, we present ImageCHD, the first medical image dataset for CHD classification. ImageCHD contains 110 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images covering most types of CHD, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging datasets. Classification of CHDs requires the identification of large structural changes without any local tissue changes, with limited data. It is an example of a larger class of problems that are quite difficult for current machine-learning based vision methods to solve. To demonstrate this, we further present a baseline framework for automatic classification of CHD, based on a state-of-the-art CHD segmentation method. Experimental results show that the baseline framework can only achieve a classification accuracy of 81.9% under selective prediction scheme with 88.8% coverage, leaving big room for further improvement. We hope that ImageCHD can stimulate further research and lead to innovative and generic solutions that would have an impact in multiple domains. Our dataset is released to the public [ 1 ] .	
 Robust Scheduling of Virtual Power Plant under Exogenous and Endogenous Uncertainties	Yunfan Zhang,Feng Liu,Zhaojian Wang,Yifan Su,WeishengWang,andShuangleiFeng	None	None	Virtual power plant (VPP) provides a flexible solution to distributed energy resources integration by aggregating renewable generation units, conventional power plants, energy storages, and flexible demands. This paper proposes a novel model for determining the optimal offering strategy in the day-ahead energy-reserve market and the optimal self-scheduling plan. It considers exogenous uncertainties (or called decision-independent uncertainties, DIUs) associated with market clearing prices and available wind power generation, as well as the endogenous uncertainties (or called decision-dependent uncertainties, DDUs) pertaining to real-time reserve deployment requests. A tractable solution method based on strong duality theory, McCormick relaxation, and the Benders‚Äô decomposition to solve the proposed stochastic adaptive robust optimization with DDUs formulation is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.	
 Global-Local Propagation Network for RGB-D Semantic Segmentation			None	Depth information matters in RGB-D semantic segmentation task for providing additional geometric information to color images. Most existing methods exploit a multi-stage fusion strategy to propagate depth feature to the RGB branch. However, at the very deep stage, the propagation in a simple element-wise addition manner can not fully utilize the depth information. We propose Global-Local propagation network (GLPNet) to solve this problem. Specifically, a local context fusion module(L-CFM) is introduced to dynamically align both modalities before element-wise fusion, and a global context fusion module(G-CFM) is introduced to propagate the depth information to the RGB branch by jointly modeling the multi-modal global context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of the proposed fusion modules. Embedding two fusion modules into a two-stream encoder-decoder structure, our GLPNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two challenging indoor scene segmentation datasets, i.e., NYU-Depth v2 and SUN-RGBD dataset.	
 Dynamical analysis approaches in spatially curved FRW spacetimes	Morteza Kerachian, ,aGiovanni Acquaviva, ,band Georgios LukesGerakopoulos, ,cInstitute of Theoretical Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, CZ Prague, Czech RepublicAstronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Bon II, CZ Prague, Czech Republicakerachianmortezagmailcombgioacquagmailcomcgglukesgmailcom	None	None	In this article, we summarize two agnostic approaches in the framework of spatially curved Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmologies discussed in detail in (Kerachian et al., 2020 , 2019 ) . The first case concerns the dynamics of a fluid with an unspecified barotropic equation of state (EoS), for which the only assumption made is the non-negativity of the fluid√¢s energy density. The second case concerns the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled real scalar field with unspecified positive potential. For each of these models, we define a new set of dimensionless variables and a new evolution parameter. In the framework of these agnostic setups, we are able to identify several general features, like symmetries, invariant subsets and critical points, and provide their cosmological interpretation.	
 ACAV100M: Automatic Curation of Large-Scale Datasets for Audio-Visual Video Representation Learning	Sangho Lee,Jiwan Chung,Youngjae Yu,Gunhee KimSeoul National University, Thomas Breuel,Gal ChechikNVIDIA Research, Yale SongMicrosoft Research, httpsacavmgithubio	None	None	The natural association between visual observations and their corresponding sound provides powerful self-supervisory signals for learning video representations, which makes the ever-growing amount of online videos an attractive source of training data. However, large portions of online videos contain irrelevant audio-visual signals because of edited/overdubbed audio, and models trained on such uncurated videos have shown to learn suboptimal representations. Therefore, existing approaches rely almost exclusively on datasets with predetermined taxonomies of semantic concepts, where there is a high chance of audio-visual correspondence. Unfortunately, constructing such datasets require labor intensive manual annotation and/or verification, which severely limits the utility of online videos for large-scale learning. In this work, we present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between audio and visual channels in videos. We demonstrate that our approach finds videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models trained on existing manually curated datasets. The most significant benefit of our approach is scalability: We release ACAV100M that contains 100 million videos with high audio-visual correspondence, ideal for self-supervised video representation learning.	
 CPTR: Full Transformer Network for Image Captioning			None	In this paper, we consider the image captioning task from a new sequence-to-sequence prediction perspective and propose CaPtion TransformeR (CPTR) which takes the sequentialized raw images as the input to Transformer. Compared to the ‚ÄúCNN+Transformer‚Äù design paradigm, our model can model global context at every encoder layer from the beginning and is totally convolution-free. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and we surpass the conventional ‚ÄúCNN+Transformer‚Äù methods on the MSCOCO dataset. Besides, we provide detailed visualizations of the self-attention between patches in the encoder and the ‚Äúwords-to-patches‚Äù attention in the decoder thanks to the full Transformer architecture.

 Recovery of underdrawings and ghost-paintings via style transfer by deep convolutional neural networks: A digital tool for art scholars	Anthony Bourached, George HCann, RyanRhys Griffiths, and David GStorkdaComputer Science Department, University College London, London, UKbDepartment of Space and Climate Physics, University College London, London, UKcDepartment of Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UKdPortola Valley, CA USA	None	None	We describe the application of convolutional neural network style transfer to the problem of improved visualization of underdrawings and ghost-paintings in fine art oil paintings. Such underdrawings and hidden paintings are typically revealed by x-ray or infrared techniques which yield images that are grayscale, and thus devoid of color and full style information. Past methods for inferring color in underdrawings have been based on physical x-ray fluorescence spectral imaging of pigments in ghost-paintings and are thus expensive, time consuming, and require equipment not available in most conservation studios. Our algorithmic methods do not need such expensive physical imaging devices. Our proof-of-concept system, applied to works by Pablo Picasso and Leonardo, reveal colors and designs that respect the natural segmentation in the ghost-painting. We believe the computed images provide insight into the artist and associated oeuvre not available by other means. Our results strongly suggest that future applications based on larger corpora of paintings for training will display color schemes and designs that even more closely resemble works of the artist. For these reasons refinements to our methods should find wide use in art conservation, connoisseurship, and art analysis.

 Exploring Transfer Learning on Face Recognition of Dark Skinned, Low Quality and Low Resource Face Data	Nuredin AliDepartment of Information SystemsMekelle University	None	None	There is a big difference in the tone of color of skin between dark and light skinned people. Despite this fact, most face recognition tasks almost all classical state-of-the-art models are trained on datasets containing an overwhelming majority of light skinned face images. It is tedious to collect a huge amount of data for dark skinned faces and train a model from scratch. In this paper, we apply transfer learning on VGGFace to check how it works on recognising dark skinned mainly Ethiopian faces. The dataset is of low quality and low resource. Our experimental results show above 95% accuracy which indicates that transfer learning in such settings works.

Recent years, data-driven methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are continuously pushing stereo matching to new heights. However, data-driven methods require large amount of training data, which is not an easy task for real stereo data due to the annotation difficulties of per-pixel ground-truth disparity. Though synthetic dataset is proposed to fill the gaps of large data demand, the fine-tuning on real dataset is still needed due to the domain variances between synthetic data and real data. In this paper, we found that in synthetic datasets, close-to-real-scene texture rendering is a key factor to boost up stereo matching performance, while close-to-real-scene 3D modeling is less important. We then propose semi-synthetic, an effective and fast way to synthesize large amount of data with close-to-real-scene texture to minimize the gap between synthetic data and real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with our proposed semi-synthetic datasets achieve significantly better performance than with general synthetic datasets, especially on real data benchmarks with limited training data. With further fine-tuning on the real dataset, we also achieve SOTA performance on Middlebury and competitive results on KITTI and ETH3D datasets.	
 Intelligent Routing to Enhance Energy Consumption in Wireless Sensor Network: A survey			None		
 Impact of Explanation on Trust of a Novel Mobile Robot	Stephanie Rosenthal and Elizabeth CarterCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh PA rosenthal,lizcartercmuedu	None	None	One challenge with introducing robots into novel environments is misalignment between supervisor expectations and reality, which can greatly affect a user‚Äôs trust and continued use of the robot. We performed an experiment to test whether the presence of an explanation of expected robot behavior affected a supervisor‚Äôs trust in an autonomous robot. We measured trust both subjectively through surveys and objectively through a dual-task experiment design to capture supervisors‚Äô neglect tolerance (i.e., their willingness to perform their own task while the robot is acting autonomously). Our objective results show that explanations can help counteract the novelty effect of seeing a new robot perform in an unknown environment. Participants who received an explanation of the robot‚Äôs behavior were more likely to focus on their own task at the risk of neglecting their robot supervision task during the first trials of the robot‚Äôs behavior compared to those who did not receive an explanation. However, this effect diminished after seeing multiple trials, and participants who received explanations were equally trusting of the robot‚Äôs behavior as those who did not receive explanations. Interestingly, participants were not able to identify their own changes in trust through their survey responses, demonstrating that the dual-task design measured subtler changes in a supervisor‚Äôs trust.

Burning and firefighting have been discussed in particular on static graphs. Graph burning simulates the notion of the spread of ‚Äúfire‚Äù throughout a graph (plus, one unburned node burned at each time-step); graph firefighting simulates the defending of nodes by placing firefighters on the nodes which have not been already burned while the fire is being spread (started by only a single fire source).

 When Would You Trust a Robot?

Theory of Mind (ToM) has been defined as the ability to understand the beliefs and intentions of others that may differ from one‚Äôs own. Evidences in psychology and HRI suggest that trust and ToM are interconnected and interdependent concepts, as the decision to trust another agent must depend on our own representation of this entity‚Äôs actions, beliefs and intentions. However, very few works take ToM of the robot into consideration while studying trust in HRI. In this paper, we investigated whether the exposure to the ToM abilities of a robot could affect humans‚Äô trust towards the robot. To this end, participants played a Price Game with a humanoid robot (Pepper) that was presented having either low-level ToM or high-level ToM . Specifically, the participants were asked to accept the price evaluations on common objects presented by the robot. The willingness of the participants to change their own price judgement of the objects (i.e., accept the price the robot suggested) was used as the main measurement of the trust towards the robot. Our experimental results showed that robots possessing a high-level of ToM abilities were trusted more than the robots presented with low-level ToM skills.	
 T-Quadratic Forms and Spectral Analysis of T-Symmetric Tensors	Liqun Qiand Xinzhen Zhang	None	None	An n √ó n √ó p ùëõ ùëõ ùëù n\times n\times p italic_n √ó italic_n √ó italic_p tensor is called a T-square tensor. It arises from many applications, such as the image feature extraction problem and the multi-view clustering problem. We may symmetrize a T-square tensor to a T-symmetric tensor. For each T-square tensor, we define a T-quadratic form, whose variable is an n √ó p ùëõ ùëù n\times p italic_n √ó italic_p matrix, and whose value is a p ùëù p italic_p -dimensional vector. We define eigentuples and eigenmatrices for T-square tensors. We show that a T-symmetric tensor has unique largest and smallest eigentuples, and a T-quadratic form is positive semi-definite (definite) if and only if its smallest eigentuple is nonnegative (positive). The relation between the eigen-decomposition of T-symmetric tensors, and the TSVD of general third order tensors are also studied.

Our system is composed of a single level quantum dot, attached to ferromagnetic leads. By properly rotating the leads magnetizations we can select the spin component to be detected. Counting the number of tunneling events taken in four different magnetic alignments we find the Stokes parameters, that are used as a train data set into a supervised machine learning algorithm. The predicted model allows the complete knowledge of the open system density matrix, including both probability amplitudes and relative phases.

 1 Introduction			None	Human societies are characterized, besides others, by three constituent features. (A) Options, as for jobs and societal positions, differ with respect to their associated monetary and non-monetary payoffs. (B) Competition leads to reduced payoffs when individuals compete for the same option with others. (C) People care how they are doing relatively to others. The latter trait, the propensity to compare one‚Äôs own success with that of others, expresses itself as envy. It is shown that the combination of (A)-(C) leads to spontaneous class stratification. Societies of agents split endogenously into two social classes, an upper and a lower class, when envy becomes relevant. A comprehensive analysis of the Nash equilibria characterizing a basic reference game is presented. Class separation is due to the condensation of the strategies of lower-class agents, which play an identical mixed strategy. Upper class agents do not condense, following individualist pure strategies. Model and results are size-consistent, holding for arbitrary large numbers of agents and options. Analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. An analogy to interacting confined classical particles is discussed.	
 Propagation and reconstruction of re-entry uncertainties using continuity equation and simplicial interpolationfootnote footnotePresented as paper AAS 19-409 at the 29th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting, Ka‚Äôanapali, HI, 13-17 January 2019	Mirko Trisolini, Camilla Colombo	None	None	This work proposes a continuum-based approach for the propagation of uncertainties in the initial conditions and parameters for the analysis and prediction of spacecraft re-entries. Using the continuity equation together with the re-entry dynamics, the joint probability distribution of the uncertainties is propagated in time for specific sampled points. At each time instant, the joint probability distribution function is then reconstructed from the scattered data using a gradient-enhanced linear interpolation based on a simplicial representation of the state space. Uncertainties in the initial conditions at re-entry and in the ballistic coefficient for three representative test cases are considered: a three-state and a six-state steep Earth re-entry and a six-state unguided lifting entry at Mars. The paper shows the comparison of the proposed method with Monte Carlo based techniques in terms of quality of the obtained marginal distributions and runtime as a function of the number of samples used.

 Garden optimization problems for benchmarking quantum annealers	Carlos Gonzalez Calaza, Dennis Willsch, Kristel Michielsen	c.gonzalez.calaza@fz-juelich.de	None	We benchmark the 5000+ qubit system Advantage coupled with the Hybrid Solver Service 2 released by D-Wave Systems Inc. in September 2020 by using a new class of optimization problems called garden optimization problems known in companion planting . These problems are scalable to an arbitrarily large number of variables and intuitively find application in real-world scenarios. We derive their QUBO formulation and illustrate their relation to the quadratic assignment problem. We demonstrate that the Advantage system and the new hybrid solver can solve larger problems in less time than their predecessors. However, we also show that the solvers based on the 2000+ qubit system DW2000Q sometimes produce more favourable results if they can solve the problems.

 Para-abelian varieties and Albanese maps	Bruno Laurent, Stefan Schrer	bruno.laurent@hhu.de	"Mathematisches Institut, Heinrich-Heine-Universit√§t,
40204 D√ºsseldorf, Germany"	We construct for every proper algebraic space over a ground field an Albanese map to a para-abelian variety, which is unique up to unique isomorphism. This holds in the absence of rational points or ample sheaves, and also for reducible or non-reduced spaces, under the mere assumption that the structure morphism is in Stein factorization. It also works under suitable assumptions in families. In fact the treatment of the relative setting is crucial, even to understand the situation over ground fields. This also ensures that Albanese maps are equivariant with respect to actions of group schemes. Our approach depends on the notion of families of para-abelian varieties, where each geometric fiber admits the structure of an abelian variety, and representability of tau-parts in relative Picard groups, together with structure results on algebraic groups.

 Revisiting Locally Supervised Learning: an Alternative to End-to-end Training	Yulin Wang, Zanlin Ni, Shiji Song, Le Yang Gao HuangDepartment of Automation, BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China,	None	None	Due to the need to store the intermediate activations for back-propagation, end-to-end (E2E) training of deep networks usually suffers from high GPUs memory footprint. This paper aims to address this problem by revisiting the locally supervised learning, where a network is split into gradient-isolated modules and trained with local supervision. We experimentally show that simply training local modules with E2E loss tends to collapse task-relevant information at early layers, and hence hurts the performance of the full model. To avoid this issue, we propose an information propagation (InfoPro) loss, which encourages local modules to preserve as much useful information as possible, while progressively discard task-irrelevant information. As InfoPro loss is difficult to compute in its original form, we derive a feasible upper bound as a surrogate optimization objective, yielding a simple but effective algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed method boils down to minimizing the combination of a reconstruction loss and a normal cross-entropy/contrastive term. Extensive empirical results on five datasets (i.e., CIFAR, SVHN, STL-10, ImageNet and Cityscapes) validate that InfoPro is capable of achieving competitive performance with less than 40% memory footprint compared to E2E training, while allowing using training data with higher-resolution or larger batch sizes under the same GPU memory constraint. Our method also enables training local modules asynchronously for potential training acceleration. Code is available at: https://github.com/blackfeather-wang/InfoPro-Pytorch .	
 DataLoc+: A Data Augmentation Technique for Machine Learning in Room-Level Indoor Localization 1 Amr Hilal is also affiliated with the Department of Computer and Systems Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt. 2 Ismail Arai was a visiting scholar at James Madison University, Virginia, USA, while working on parts of this paper.	Amr Hilal, Ismail Arai, Samy ElTawab	None	None	Indoor localization has been a hot area of research over the past two decades. Since its advent, it has been steadily utilizing the emerging technologies to improve accuracy, and machine learning has been at the heart of that. Machine learning has been increasingly used in fingerprint-based indoor localization to replace or emulate the radio map that is used to predict locations given a location signature. The prediction quality of a machine learning model primarily depends on how well the model was trained, which relies on the amount and quality of data used to train it. Data augmentation has been used to improve quality of the trained models by synthetically producing more training data, and several approaches were used in the literature that tackles the problem of lack of training data from different angles. In this paper, we propose DataLoc+, a data augmentation technique for room-level indoor localization that combines different approaches in a simple algorithm. We evaluate the technique by comparing it to the typical direct snapshot approach using data collected from a field experiment conducted in a hospital. Our evaluation shows that the model trained using the proposed technique achieves higher accuracy. We also show that the technique adapts to larger problems using a limited dataset while maintaining high accuracy.	
 SGR 0755-2933: a new High Mass X-ray binary with the wrong name	VDoroshenko, Santangelo, STsygankov, Ji	None	None	The soft gamma-ray repeater candidate SGR~0755$-$2933 was discovered in 2016 by Swift /BAT, which detected a short ( ‚àº 30 similar-to absent 30 \sim 30 ‚àº 30 ms) powerful burst typical of magnetars. To understand the nature of the source, we present here an analysis of follow-up observations of the tentative soft X-ray counterpart of the source obtained with Swift /XRT, NuSTAR and Chandra . From our analysis we conclude that, based on the observed counterpart position and properties, it is actually not a soft gamma ray repeater but rather a new high mass X-ray binary. We suggest to refer to it as 2SXPS J075542.5 ‚àí - - 293353. We conclude, therefore, that the available data do not allow us to confirm existence and identify the true soft X-ray counterpart to the burst event. Presence of a soft counterpart is, however, essential to unambiguously associate the burst with a magnetar flare, and thus we conclude that magnetar origin of the burst and precise burst location remain uncertain and require further investigation.

 The Ikshana Hypothesis of Human Scene Understanding	Venkata Satya Sai Ajay DaliparthiBlekinge Insitute of TechnologyKarlskrona, Sweden	None	None	In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) achieved state-of-the-art performance on several computer vision tasks. However, the one typical drawback of these DNNs is the requirement of massive labeled data. Even though few-shot learning methods address this problem, they often use techniques such as meta-learning and metric-learning on top of the existing methods. In this work, we address this problem from a neuroscience perspective by proposing a hypothesis named Ikshana, which is supported by several findings in neuroscience. Our hypothesis approximates the refining process of conceptual gist in the human brain while understanding a natural scene/image. While our hypothesis holds no particular novelty in neuroscience, it provides a novel perspective for designing DNNs for vision tasks. By following the Ikshana hypothesis, we design a novel neural-inspired CNN architecture named IkshanaNet. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming several baselines on the entire and subsets of the Cityscapes and the CamVid semantic segmentation benchmarks.	
 Visible light communication-based monitoring for indoor environments using unsupervised learning	Mehmet IlterstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alexis DowhuszkostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jyri HmlinenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Risto WichmanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems provide not only illumination and data communication, but also indoor monitoring services if the effect that different events create on the received optical signal is properly tracked. For this purpose, the Channel State Information that a VLC receiver computes to equalize the subcarriers of the OFDM signal can be also reused to train an Unsupervised Learning classifier. This way, different clusters can be created on the collected CSI data, which could be then mapped into relevant events to-be-monitored in the indoor environments, such as the presence of a new object in a given position or the change of the position of a given object. When compared to supervised learning algorithms, the proposed approach does not need to add tags in the training data, simplifying notably the implementation of the machine learning classifier. The practical validation the monitoring approach was done with the aid of a software-defined VLC link based on OFDM, in which a copy of the intensity modulated signal coming from a Phosphor-converted LED was captured by a pair of Photodetectors (PDs). The performance evaluation of the experimental VLC-based monitoring demo achieved a positioning accuracy in the few-centimeter-range, without the necessity of deploying a large number of sensors and/or adding a VLC-enabled sensor on the object to-be-tracked.

 PConv: Simple yet Effective Convolutional Layer for Generative Adversarial Network	Seung Park, YoonJae Yeo, YongGoo Shin	None	None	This paper presents a novel convolutional layer, called perturbed convolution (PConv), which focuses on achieving two goals simultaneously: improving the generative adversarial network (GAN) performance and alleviating the memorization problem in which the discriminator memorizes all images from a given dataset as training progresses. In PConv, perturbed features are generated by randomly disturbing an input tensor before performing the convolution operation. This approach is simple but surprisingly effective. First, to produce a similar output even with the perturbed tensor, each layer in the discriminator should learn robust features having a small local Lipschitz value. Second, since the input tensor is randomly perturbed during the training procedure like the dropout in neural networks, the memorization problem could be alleviated. To show the generalization ability of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments with various loss functions and datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ, LSUN, and tiny-ImageNet. The quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PConv effectively boosts the performance of GAN and conditional GAN in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID).	
 Source-free Domain Adaptation via Distributional Alignment by Matching Batch Normalization Statistics	Masato IshiistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Masashi Sugiyama,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation method for the source-free setting. In this setting, we cannot access source data during adaptation, while unlabeled target data and a model pretrained with source data are given. Due to lack of source data, we cannot directly match the data distributions between domains unlike typical domain adaptation algorithms. To cope with this problem, we propose utilizing batch normalization statistics stored in the pretrained model to approximate the distribution of unobserved source data. Specifically, we fix the classifier part of the model during adaptation and only fine-tune the remaining feature encoder part so that batch normalization statistics of the features extracted by the encoder match those stored in the fixed classifier. Additionally, we also maximize the mutual information between the features and the classifier‚Äôs outputs to further boost the classification performance. Experimental results with several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods even though it does not require access to source data.	
 Examples of geodesic ghor algebras on hyperbolic surfaces	Karin Baur, Charlie Beil	pmtkb@leeds.ac.uk	School of Mathematics, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom	Cancellative dimer algebras on a torus have many nice algebraic and homological properties. However, these nice properties disappear for dimer algebras on higher genus surfaces. We consider a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called ‚Äògeodesic ghor algebras‚Äô, that reduce to cancellative dimer algebras on a torus, yet continue to have nice properties on higher genus surfaces. These algebras exhibit a rich interplay between their central geometry and the topology of the surface. We show that (nontrivial) geodesic ghor algebras do in fact exist, and give explicit descriptions of their central geometry. This article serves a companion to the article ‚ÄòA generalization of cancellative dimer aglebras to hyperbolic surfaces‚Äô, where the main statement is proven.	
 Deep View Synthesis via Self-Consistent Generative Network	ZhuomanLiustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,WeiJiastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,MingYang,PeiyaoLuo,YongGuo,andMingkuiTandaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	View synthesis aims to produce unseen views from a set of views captured by two or more cameras at different positions. This task is non-trivial since it is hard to conduct pixel-level matching among different views. To address this issue, most existing methods seek to exploit the geometric information to match pixels. However, when the distinct cameras have a large baseline ( i.e. , far away from each other), severe geometry distortion issues would occur and the geometric information may fail to provide useful guidance, resulting in very blurry synthesized images. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep generative model, called Self-Consistent Generative Network (SCGN), which synthesizes novel views from the given input views without explicitly exploiting the geometric information. The proposed SCGN model consists of two main components, i.e. , a View Synthesis Network (VSN) and a View Decomposition Network (VDN), both employing an Encoder-Decoder structure. Here, the VDN seeks to reconstruct input views from the synthesized novel view to preserve the consistency of view synthesis. Thanks to VDN, SCGN is able to synthesize novel views without using any geometric rectification before encoding, making it easier for both training and applications. Finally, adversarial loss is introduced to improve the photo-realism of novel views. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons against several state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark tasks demonstrated the superiority of our approach.

 Sinc-based convolutional neural networks for EEG-BCI-based motor imagery classificationThis work was supported by MIUR (Minister for Education, University and Research, Law 232/216, Department of Excellence).	Alessandro Bria, Claudio Marrocco, Francesco Tortorella	None	None	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on motor imagery translate mental motor images recognized from the electroencephalogram (EEG) to control commands. EEG patterns of different imagination tasks, e.g. hand and foot movements, are effectively classified with machine learning techniques using band power features. Recently, also Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that learn both effective features and classifiers simultaneously from raw EEG data have been applied. However, CNNs have two major drawbacks: (i) they have a very large number of parameters, which thus requires a very large number of training examples; and (ii) they are not designed to explicitly learn features in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, in this work we introduce Sinc-EEGNet, a lightweight CNN architecture that combines learnable band-pass and depthwise convolutional filters. Experimental results obtained on the publicly available BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a show that our approach outperforms reference methods in terms of classification accuracy.	
 Soft pions and transport near the chiral critical point	Eduardo Grossi, Alexander Soloviev, Derek Teaney, Fanglida Yan	eduardo.grossi@stonybrook.edu	None	Background: During the expansion of a heavy ion collision, the system passes close to the O ( 4 ) ùëÇ 4 O(4) italic_O ( 4 ) critical point of QCD, and thus the fluctuations of the order parameter ( œÉ , œÄ ‚Üí ) ùúé ‚Üí ùúã (\sigma,\vec{\pi}) ( italic_œÉ , over‚Üí start_ARG italic_œÄ end_ARG ) are expected to be enhanced. Purpose: Our goal is to compute how these enhanced fluctuations modify the transport coefficients of QCD near the pseudo-critical point. We also make a phenomenological estimate for how chiral fluctuations could effect the momentum spectrum of soft pions. Method: We first formulate the appropriate stochastic hydrodynamic equations close to the O ( 4 ) ùëÇ 4 O(4) italic_O ( 4 ) critical point. Then, working in mean field, we determine the correlation functions of the stress tensor and the currents which result from this stochastic real time theory, and use these correlation functions to determine the scaling behavior of the transport coefficients. The hydrodynamic theory also describes the propagation of pion waves, fixing the scaling behavior of the dispersion curve of soft pions. Results: We present scaling functions for the shear viscosity and the charge conductivities near the pseudo-critical point, and estimate the absolute magnitude of the critical fluctuations to these parameters and the bulk viscosity. Using the calculated pion dispersion curve, we estimate the expected critical enhancement of soft pion yields, and this estimate provides a plausible explanation for the excess seen in experiment relative to ordinary hydrodynamic computations. Conclusions: Our results motivate further phenomenological and numerical work on the implications of chiral symmetry on real time properties of thermal QCD near the pseudo-critical point.

 The Central Engines of Fermi Blazars	Vaidehi Paliya, Domnguez, Ajello, OlmoGarca, Hartmann	None	None	We present a catalog of central engine properties, i.e., black hole mass ( M BH subscript ùëÄ BH M_{\rm BH} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and accretion luminosity ( L disk subscript ùêø disk L_{\rm disk} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), for a sample of 1077 blazars detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. This includes broad emission line systems and blazars whose optical spectra lack emission lines but dominated by the absorption features arising from the host galaxy. The average M BH subscript ùëÄ BH M_{\rm BH} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for the sample is ‚ü® log ‚Å° M BH , all M ‚äô ‚ü© = 8.60 delimited-‚ü®‚ü© subscript ùëÄ BH all subscript ùëÄ direct-product 8.60 \langle\log~{}M_{{\rm BH,all}~{}M_{\odot}}\rangle=8.60 ‚ü® roman_log italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH , roman_all italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ü© = 8.60 and there are evidences suggesting the association of more massive black holes with absorption line systems. Our results indicate a bi-modality of L disk subscript ùêø disk L_{\rm disk} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in Eddington units ( L disk subscript ùêø disk L_{\rm disk} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / L Edd subscript ùêø Edd L_{\rm Edd} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Edd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) with broad line objects tend to have a higher accretion rate ( L disk subscript ùêø disk L_{\rm disk} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / L Edd subscript ùêø Edd L_{\rm Edd} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Edd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > > > 0.01). We have found that L disk subscript ùêø disk L_{\rm disk} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / L Edd subscript ùêø Edd L_{\rm Edd} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Edd end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Compton dominance (CD, the ratio of the inverse Compton to synchrotron peak luminosities) are positively correlated at > > > 5 œÉ ùúé \sigma italic_œÉ confidence level, suggesting that the latter can be used to reveal the state of accretion in blazars. Based on this result, we propose a CD based classification scheme. Sources with CD > > > 1 can be classified as High-Compton Dominated or HCD blazars, whereas, that with CD ‚â≤ less-than-or-similar-to \lesssim ‚â≤ 1 are Low-Compton Dominated (LCD) objects. This scheme is analogous to that based on the mass accretion rate proposed in the literature, however, it overcomes the limitation imposed by the difficulty in measuring L disk subscript ùêø disk L_{\rm disk} italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and M BH subscript ùëÄ BH M_{\rm BH} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for objects with quasi-featureless spectra. We conclude that the overall physical properties of Fermi blazars are likely to be controlled by the accretion rate in Eddington units.

We also analyze the stability of the model by using sound speed as well as adiabatic index and discuss certain special cases of the model. We find special equation of state in this model which yields to dynamical and thermodynamical stability. Furthermore, we study the cosmological consequences of this model under certain conditions.	
 How Much Communication Resource is Needed to Run a Wireless Blockchain Network?	Lei Zhang, Hao Xu, Oluwakayode Onireti, Muhammad Ali Imran and Bin Cao	None	None	Blockchain is built on a peer-to-peer network that relies on frequent communications among the distributively located nodes. In particular, the consensus mechanisms (CMs), which play a pivotal role in blockchain, are communication resource-demanding and largely determines blockchain security bound and other key performance metrics such as transaction throughput, latency and scalability. Most blockchain systems are designed in a stable wired communication network running in advanced devices under the assumption of sufficient communication resource provision. However, it is envisioned that the majority of the blockchain node peers will be connected through the wireless network in the future. Constrained by the highly dynamic wireless channel and scarce frequency spectrum, communication can significantly affect blockchain‚Äôs key performance metrics. Hence, in this paper, we present wireless blockchain networks (WBN) under various commonly used CMs and we answer the question of how much communication resource is needed to run such a network. We first present the role of communication in the four stages of the blockchain procedure. We then discuss the relationship between the communication resource provision and the WBNs performance, for three of the most used blockchain CMs namely, Proof-of-Work (PoW), practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) and Raft. Finally, we provide analytical and simulated results to show the impact of the communication resource provision on blockchain performance.

 The Higgs Field and the Jordan Brans Dicke Cosmology	Onder Dunya, Levent Akant, Metin Arik, Yelda Kardas,Selale Sahinand Tarik Tok	None	None	We investigate a field theoretical approach to the Jordan-Brans- Dicke (JBD) theory extended with a particular potential term on a cosmological background by starting with the motivation that the Higgs field and the scale factor of the universe are related. Based on this relation, it is possible to come up with mathematically equivalent but two different interpretations. From one point of view while the universe is static, the masses of the elementary particles change with time. The other one, which we stick with throughout the manuscript, is that while the universe is expanding, particle masses are constant. Thus, a coupled Lagrangian density of the JBD field and the scale factor (the Higgs field), which exhibit a massive particle and a linearly expanding space in zeroth order respectively, is obtained. By performing a coordinate transformation in the field space for the reduced JBD action whose kinetic part is nonlinear sigma model, the Lagrangian of two scalar fields can be written as uncoupled for the Higgs mechanism. After this transformation, as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the time dependent vacuum expectation value (vev) of the Higgs field and the Higgs bosons which are the particles corresponding to quantized oscillation modes about the vacuum, are found.

 BE-RAN: Blockchain-enabled Open RAN with Decentralized Identity Management and Privacy-Preserving Communication	HaoXu,LeiZhang,YunqingSun,andChihLinI	None	None	Radio Access Networks (RAN) tends to be more distributed in the 5G and beyond, in order to provide low latency and flexible on-demanding services. In this paper, Blockchain-enabled Radio Access Networks (BE-RAN) is proposed as a novel decentralized RAN architecture to facilitate enhanced security and privacy on identification and authentication. It can offer user-centric identity management for User Equipment (UE) and RAN elements, and enable mutual authentication to all entities while enabling on-demand point-to-point communication with accountable billing service add-on on public network. Also, a potential operating model with thorough decentralization of RAN is envisioned. The paper also proposed a distributed privacy-preserving P2P communication approach, as one of the core use cases for future mobile networks, is presented as an essential complement to the existing core network-based security and privacy management. The results show that BE-RAN significantly improves communication and computation overheads compared to the existing communication authentication protocols.

 The strong effect of network resolution on electricity system models with high shares of wind and solar	Martha Maria Frysztacki, Jonas Hrsch, Veit Hagenmeyer, Tom Brown	None	Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany	Energy system modellers typically choose a low spatial resolution for their models based on administrative boundaries such as countries, which eases data collection and reduces computation times. However, a low spatial resolution can lead to sub-optimal investment decisions for wind and solar generation. Ignoring power grid bottlenecks within regions tends to underestimate system costs, while combining locations with different wind and solar capacity factors in the same resource class tends to overestimate costs. We investigate these two competing effects in a capacity expansion model for Europe‚Äôs power system with a high share of renewables, taking advantage of newly-available high-resolution datasets as well as computational advances. We vary the number of nodes, interpolating between a 37-node model based on country and synchronous zone boundaries, and a 1024-node model based on the location of electricity substations. If we focus on the effect of renewable resource resolution and ignore network restrictions, we find that a higher resolution allows the optimal solution to concentrate wind and solar capacity at sites with better capacity factors and thus reduces system costs by up to 10% compared to a low resolution model. This results in a big swing from offshore to onshore wind investment. However, if we introduce grid bottlenecks by raising the network resolution, costs increase by up to 23% as generation has to be sourced more locally at sites with worse capacity factors. These effects are most pronounced in scenarios where grid expansion is limited, for example, by low local acceptance. We show that allowing grid expansion mitigates some of the effects of the low grid resolution, and lowers overall costs by around 16%.	
 Uniqueness of universal dimensions and configurations of points and lines		None	None	The problem of uniqueness of universal formulae for (quantum) dimensions of simple Lie algebras is investigated and connection of some of these functions with geometrical configurations, such as the famous Pappus-Brianchon-Pascal ( 9 3 ) 1 subscript subscript 9 3 1 (9_{3})_{1} ( 9 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT configuration of points and lines, is established by proposing some generic functions, which multiplied by a universal (quantum) dimension formula, preserve both its structure and its values at the points from Vogel‚Äôs table.

Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based applications have dominated aerial sensing research. However, a literature revision that combines both ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù and ‚ÄúUAV remote sensing‚Äù thematics has not yet been conducted.

We focused mainly on describing classification and regression techniques used in recent applications with UAV-acquired data. For that, a total of 232 papers published in international scientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published material and evaluated their characteristics regarding application, sensor, and technique used. We relate how DL presents promising results and has the potential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data. Lastly, we project future perspectives, commentating on prominent DL paths to be explored in the UAV remote sensing field. Our revision consists of a friendly-approach to introduce, commentate, and summarize the state-of-the-art in UAV-based image applications with DNNs algorithms in diverse subfields of remote sensing, grouping it in the environmental, urban, and agricultural contexts.

 On the value function for nonautonomous optimal control problems with infinite horizon	JBaumeisterDepartment of Mathematics, Goethe University,RobertMayer Str , Frankfurt aM, GermanyALeitoDepartment of Mathematics,Federal University of St Catarina, Florianopolis, BrazilGNSilvaDepartment of Computer Sciences and Statistics,Universidade Estadual Paulista, SJ Rio Preto, Brazil	None	None	In this paper we consider nonautonomous optimal control problems of infinite horizon type, whose control actions are given by L 1 superscript ùêø 1 L^{1} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -functions. We verify that the value function is locally Lipschitz. The equivalence between dynamic programming inequalities and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) inequalities for proximal sub (super) gradients is proven. Using this result we show that the value function is a Dini solution of the HJB equation. We obtain a verification result for the class of Dini sub-solutions of the HJB equation and also prove a minimax property of the value function with respect to the sets of Dini semi-solutions of the HJB equation. We introduce the concept of viscosity solutions of the HJB equation in infinite horizon and prove the equivalence between this and the concept of Dini solutions. In the appendix we provide an existence theorem.	
 Bulk topological states in a new collective dynamics model	Pierre, Antoine, Mingye	None	None	In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of topological states in a new collective dynamics model. This individual-based model (IBM) describes self-propelled rigid bodies moving with constant speed and adjusting their rigid-body attitude to that of their neighbors. In previous works, a macroscopic model has been derived from this IBM in a suitable scaling limit. In the present work, we exhibit explicit solutions of the macroscopic model characterized by a non-trivial topology. We show that these solutions are well approximated by the IBM during a certain time but then the IBM transitions towards topologically trivial states. Using a set of appropriately defined topological indicators, we reveal that the breakage of the non-trivial topology requires the system to go through a phase of maximal disorder. We also show that similar but topologically trivial initial conditions result in markedly different dynamics, suggesting that topology plays a key role in the dynamics of this system.	
 On managing vulnerabilities in AI/ML systems	Jonathan Spring, April Galyardt, Allen Householder, Nathan VanHoudnos	jspring AT sei dot cmu dot edu	None	This paper explores how the current paradigm of vulnerability management might adapt to include machine learning systems through a thought experiment: what if flaws in machine learning ( ML ) were assigned identifiers ? We consider both ML algorithms and model objects. The hypothetical scenario is structured around exploring the changes to the six areas of vulnerability management: discovery, report intake, analysis, coordination, disclosure, and response. While algorithm flaws are well-known in the academic research community, there is no apparent clear line of communication between this research community and the operational communities that deploy and manage systems that use ML . The thought experiments identify some ways in which CVE-IDs may establish some useful lines of communication between these two communities. In particular, it would start to introduce the research community to operational security concepts, which appears to be a gap left by existing efforts.	
 Deep neural network-based automatic metasurface design with a wide frequency range	Fardin Ghorbani, Sina Beyraghi, Javad Shabanpour, Homayoon Oraizi, Hossein Soleimani, Mohammad Soleimani	fardin.ghorbania@gmail.com	None	Beyond the scope of conventional metasurface which necessitates plenty of computational resources and time, an inverse design approach using machine learning algorithms promises an effective way for metasurfaces design. In this paper, benefiting from Deep Neural Network (DNN), an inverse design procedure of a metasurface in an ultra-wide working frequency band is presented where the output unit cell structure can be directly computed by a specified design target. To reach the highest working frequency, for training the DNN, we consider 8 ring-shaped patterns to generate resonant notches at a wide range of working frequencies from 4 to 45 GHz. We propose two network architectures. In one architecture, we restricted the output of the DNN, so the network can only generate the metasurface structure from the input of 8 ring-shaped patterns. This approach drastically reduces the computational time, while keeping the network‚Äôs accuracy above 91%. We show that our model based on DNN can satisfactorily generate the output metasurface structure with an average accuracy of over 90% in both network architectures. Determination of the metasurface structure directly without time-consuming optimization procedures, having ultra-wide working frequency, and high average accuracy equip an inspiring platform for engineering projects without the need for complex electromagnetic theory.	
 On the robustness of certain norms	William Leeb	None	None	We study a family of norms defined for functions on an interval. These norms are obtained by taking the p ùëù p italic_p -norm of the Volterra operator applied to the function. The corresponding distances have been previously studied in the context of comparing probability measures, and special cases include the Earth Mover‚Äôs Distance and Kolmogorov Metric. We study their properties for general signals, and show that they are robust to additive noise. We also show that the norm-induced distance between a function and its perturbation is bounded by the size of the perturbation, and that the distance between one-dimensional projections of a two-dimensional function is bounded by the size of the difference in projection directions. The results are illustrated in numerical experiments.

Based on recent news, techniques, and research, we indicate three increasing privacy threats caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. After that, we provide a systematic analysis of potential privacy issues related to the COVID pandemic. Furthermore, we propose a series of research directions about online user self-disclosure and privacy issues for future work as well as possible solutions.

 B-HAR: an open-source baseline framework for in depth study of human activity recognition datasets and workflows	Florenc Demrozi, , Cristian Turetta, and Graziano Pravadelli	None	None	Human Activity Recognition (HAR), based on machine and deep learning algorithms is considered one of the most promising technologies to monitor professional and daily life activities for different categories of people (e.g., athletes, elderly, kids, employers) in order to provide a variety of services related, for example to well-being, empowering of technical performances, prevention of risky situation, and educational purposes. However, the analysis of the effectiveness and the efficiency of HAR methodologies suffers from the lack of a standard workflow, which might represent the baseline for the estimation of the quality of the developed pattern recognition models. This makes the comparison among different approaches a challenging task. In addition, researchers can make mistakes that, when not detected, definitely affect the achieved results. To mitigate such issues, this paper proposes an open-source automatic and highly configurable framework, named B-HAR, for the definition, standardization, and development of a baseline framework in order to evaluate and compare HAR methodologies. It implements the most popular data processing methods for data preparation and the most commonly used machine and deep learning pattern recognition models.	
 Chromospheric Activity in 55 Cancri: I. Results from Theoretical Wave Studies	Diaa FawzystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Manfred CuntzstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTFaculty of Engineering, Izmir University of Economics, Izmir, TurkeystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Physics, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX , USA	None	None	We present theoretical models of chromospheric heating for 55 Cancri, an orange dwarf of relatively low activity. Self-consistent, nonlinear and time-dependent ab-initio numerical computations are pursued encompassing the generation, propagation, and dissipation of waves. We consider longitudinal waves operating among arrays of flux tubes as well as acoustic waves pertaining to nonmagnetic stellar regions. Additionally, flux enhancements for the longitudinal waves are also taken into account as supplied by transverse tube waves. The Ca II K fluxes are computed (multi-ray treatment) assuming partial redistribution as well as time-dependent ionization. The self-consistent treatment of time-dependent ionization (especially for hydrogen) greatly impacts the atmospheric temperatures and electron densities (especially behind the shocks); it also affects the emergent Ca II fluxes. Particularly, we focus on the influence of magnetic heating on the stellar atmospheric structure and the emergent Ca II emission, as well as the impact of nonlinearities. Our study shows that a higher photospheric magnetic filling factor entails a larger Ca II emission; however, an increased initial wave energy flux (e.g., associated with mode coupling) is of little difference. Comparisons of our theoretical results with observations will be conveyed in forthcoming Paper II.	
 Vortex rings from high energy central p+A collisions	Michael Annan Lisa, Joo Guilherme Prado Barbon, David Dobrigkeit Chinellato, Willian Matioli Serenone, Chun Shen, Jun Takahashi, Giorgio Torrieri	None	None	Relativistic p+A collisions may produce droplets of quark gluon plasma (QGP) that quickly develop a toroidal vortex structure similar to that of an expanding smoke ring. We present viscous relativistic hydrodynamic calculations of ultra-central p+A collisions and develop an experimental observable to probe the structure, correlating the polarization and momentum of hyperons emitted from the collision. This effect is robust against changes in the definition of vorticity used to calculate the polarization. Experiments at RHIC and LHC may test the existence and strength of the vortex toroids, bringing new evidence to bear on the question of collectivity in the smallest QGP droplets.

Physics however aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. While most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces [ 1 , 2 ] . This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural [ 3 ] . In fact, previous works showed that such ‚Äòreal quantum theory‚Äô can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states [ 4 ] . Thus, are complex numbers really needed in the quantum formalism? Here, we show this to be case by proving that real and complex quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment whose successful realization would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.	
 INT monitoring survey of Local Group dwarf galaxies: star formation history and chemical enrichment	Parto, Sh Dehghani, Javadi, Saremi, Th van Loon, Khosroshahi, Mirtorabi, Abdollahi, Gholami, SA Hashemi, Navabi, Noori, Aghdam, Torki, Vafaeizade	None	None	The Local Group (LG) hosts many dwarf galaxies with diverse physical characteristics in terms of morphology, mass, star formation, and metallicity. To this end, LG can offer a unique site to tackle questions about the formation and evolution of galaxies by providing detailed information. While large telescopes are often the first choices for such studies, small telescope surveys that perform dedicated observations are still important, particularly in studying bright objects in the nearby universe. In this regard, we conducted a nine epoch survey of 55 dwarf galaxies called the ‚ÄúLocal Group dwarf galaxies survey‚Äù using the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in the La Palma to identify Long-Period Variable (LPV) stars, namely Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Super Giant (RSG) stars. AGB stars formed at different times and studying their radial distribution and mass-loss rate can shed light on the structure formation in galaxies. To further investigate the evolutionary path of these galaxies, we construct their star formation history (SFH) using the LPV stars, which are at the final stages of their evolution and therefore experience brightness fluctuations on the timescales between hundred to thousand days. In this paper, we present some of the results of the Local Group dwarf galaxies survey.

Besides having a large impact on the star formation history, mergers are also able to influence gas motions at the centre of galaxies and trigger an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). In this paper, we present a case study of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2992, which together with NGC 2993 forms the early-stage merger system Arp 245. Using Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) integral field unit (IFU) data from the inner 1.1 kpc of the galaxy we were able to spatially resolve the stellar populations, the ionisation mechanism and kinematics of ionised gas. From full spectral synthesis, we found that the stellar population is primarily composed by old metal-rich stars (t ‚â• \geq ‚â• 1.4 Gyr, Z ‚â• 2.0 ùëç 2.0 Z\geq 2.0 italic_Z ‚â• 2.0 Z ‚äô subscript Z direct-product {\rm Z_{\odot}} roman_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), with a contribution of at most 30 per cent of the light from a young and metal-poor population (t ‚â§ \leq ‚â§ 100 Myr, Z ‚â§ 1.0 ùëç 1.0 Z\leq 1.0 italic_Z ‚â§ 1.0 Z ‚äô subscript Z direct-product {\rm Z_{\odot}} roman_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ).

 Blind Image Denoising and Inpainting Using Robust Hadamard Autoencoders	Rasika Karkare, Randy Paffenroth, Gunjan Mahindre	None	None	In this paper, we demonstrate how deep autoencoders can be generalized to the case of inpainting and denoising, even when no clean training data is available. In particular, we show how neural networks can be trained to perform all of these tasks simultaneously. While, deep autoencoders implemented by way of neural networks have demonstrated potential for denoising and anomaly detection, standard autoencoders have the drawback that they require access to clean data for training. However, recent work in Robust Deep Autoencoders (RDAEs) shows how autoencoders can be trained to eliminate outliers and noise in a dataset without access to any clean training data. Inspired by this work, we extend RDAEs to the case where data are not only noisy and have outliers, but also only partially observed. Moreover, the dataset we train the neural network on has the properties that all entries have noise, some entries are corrupted by large mistakes, and many entries are not even known. Given such an algorithm, many standard tasks, such as denoising, image inpainting, and unobserved entry imputation can all be accomplished simultaneously within the same framework. Herein we demonstrate these techniques on standard machine learning tasks, such as image inpainting and denoising for the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. However, these approaches are not only applicable to image processing problems, but also have wide ranging impacts on datasets arising from real-world problems, such as manufacturing and network processing, where noisy, partially observed data naturally arise.	
 Leveraging End-to-End ASR for Endangered Language Documentation: An Empirical Study on Yolox√≥chitl Mixtec	Jiatong ShistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTJonathan AmithstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTRey Castillo GarcastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTThe Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United StatesstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Anthropology, Gettysburg CollegestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSecretara de Educacin Pblica, Estado de Guerrero, Mexico	None	None	‚ÄúTranscription bottlenecks‚Äù, created by a shortage of effective human transcribers are one of the main challenges to endangered language (EL) documentation. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been suggested as a tool to overcome such bottlenecks. Following this suggestion, we investigated the effectiveness for EL documentation of end-to-end ASR, which unlike Hidden Markov Model ASR systems, eschews linguistic resources but is instead more dependent on large-data settings. We open source a Yolox√≥chitl Mixtec EL corpus. First, we review our method in building an end-to-end ASR system in a way that would be reproducible by the ASR community. We then propose a novice transcription correction task and demonstrate how ASR systems and novice transcribers can work together to improve EL documentation. We believe this combinatory methodology would mitigate the transcription bottleneck and transcriber shortage that hinders EL documentation.	
 Blue extreme disk-runaway stars with Gaia EDR3	AndreasIrrgang, MarkusDimpel, UlrichHeber, RobertoRaddi	None	None	Since the discovery of hypervelocity stars in 2005, it has been widely believed that only the disruption of a binary system by a supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC), that is, the so-called Hills mechanism, is capable of accelerating stars to beyond the Galactic escape velocity. In the meantime, however, driven by the Gaia space mission, there is mounting evidence that many of the most extreme high-velocity early-type stars at high Galactic latitudes do originate in the Galactic disk and not in the GC. Moreover, the ejection velocities of these extreme disk-runaway stars exceed the predicted limits of the classical scenarios for the production of runaway stars. Based on proper motions from the Gaia early data release 3 and on recent and new spectrophotometric distances, we studied the kinematics of 30 such extreme disk-runaway stars, allowing us to deduce their spatial origins in and their ejection velocities from the Galactic disk with unprecedented precision. Only three stars in the sample have past trajectories that are consistent with an origin in the GC, most notably S5-HVS 1, which is the most extreme object in the sample by far. All other program stars are shown to be disk runaways with ejection velocities that sharply contrast at least with classical ejection scenarios. They include HVS 5 and HVS 6, which are both gravitationally unbound to the Milky Way. While most stars originate from within a galactocentric radius of 15 kpc, which corresponds to the observed extent of the spiral arms, a group of five stars stems from radii of about 21‚Äì29 kpc. This indicates a possible link to outer Galactic rings and a potential origin from infalling satellite galaxies.

Either Pearson‚Äôs chi-squared test of independence, or the G ùê∫ G italic_G -test, are typically used for this task, but we argue that these tests have serious deficiencies, both in terms of their inability to control the size of the test, and their power properties. By contrast, the USP test is guaranteed to control the size of the test at the nominal level for all sample sizes, has no issues with small (or zero) cell counts, and is able to detect distributions that violate independence in only a minimal way. The test statistic is derived from a U ùëà U italic_U -statistic estimator of a natural population measure of dependence, and we prove that this is the unique minimum variance unbiased estimator of this population quantity. The practical utility of the USP test is demonstrated on both simulated data, where its power can be dramatically greater than those of Pearson‚Äôs test and the G ùê∫ G italic_G -test, and on real data.

 Accelerated Polynomial Evaluation and Differentiation at Power Series in Multiple Double PrecisionSupported by the National Science Foundation under grant DMS 1854513.	Jan Verschelde	None	None	The problem is to evaluate a polynomial in several variables and its gradient at a power series truncated to some finite degree with multiple double precision arithmetic. To compensate for the cost overhead of multiple double precision and power series arithmetic, data parallel algorithms for general purpose graphics processing units are presented. The reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation is organized into a massively parallel computation of many convolutions and additions of truncated power series. Experimental results demonstrate that teraflop performance is obtained in deca double precision with power series truncated at degree 152. The algorithms scale well for increasing precision and increasing degrees.

 Solitary waves and double layers in complex plasma media	Mamuna,cand Abdul Mannana,b	None	None	A complex plasma medium (containing Cairns nonthermal electron species, adiabatically warm inertial ion species, and stationary positively charged dust (PCD) species (making a plasma system very complex) is considered. The effects of PCD species, nonthermal electron species, and adiabatic ion-temperature on ion-acoustic (IA) solitary waves (SWs) and double layers (DLs) are investigated by the pseudo-potential approach, which is valid for the arbitrary amplitude time-independent SWs and DLs. It is observed that the presence of the PCD species reduces the phase speed of the IA waves, and consequently supports the IA subsonic compressive SWs in such electron-ion-PCD plasmas. On the other hand, the increase in both adiabatic ion-temperature and the number of nonthermal or fast electrons causes to reduce the possibility for the formation of the subsonic SWs, and thus convert subsonic SWs into supersonic ones. It is also observed that after at a certain value of the nonthermal parameter, the IA supersonic SWs with both positive and negative potentials as well as the DLs with only negative potential exist. The applications of the work in space environments (viz. Earth‚Äôs mesosphere, cometary tails, Jupiter‚Äôs magnetosphere, etc.) and laboratory devices, where the warm ion and nonthermal electron species along with PCD species have been observed, are briefly discussed.

Mechanical instabilities can be exploited to design innovative structures, able to change their shape in the presence of external stimuli. In this work, we derive a mathematical model of an elastic beam subjected to an axial force and constrained to smoothly slide along a rigid support, where the distance between the rod midline and the constraint is fixed and finite. Using both theoretical and computational techniques, we characterize the bifurcations of such a mechanical system, in which the axial force and the natural curvature of the beam are used as control parameters. We show that, in the presence of a straight support, the rod can deform into shapes exhibiting helices and perversions, namely transition zones connecting together two helices with opposite chirality. The mathematical predictions of the proposed model are also compared with some experiments, showing a good quantitative agreement. In particular, we find that the buckled configurations may exhibit multiple perversions and we propose a possible explanation for this phenomenon based on the energy landscape of the mechanical system.

 Regularizing (away) vacuum energy	Adam Koberinski	None	None	In this paper I formulate Minimal Requirements for Candidate Predictions in quantum field theories, inspired by viewing the standard model as an effective field theory. I then survey standard effective field theory regularization procedures, to see if the vacuum expectation value of energy density ( ‚ü® œÅ ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© ùúå \langle\rho\rangle ‚ü® italic_œÅ ‚ü© ) is a quantity that meets these requirements. The verdict is negative, leading to the conclusion that ‚ü® œÅ ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© ùúå \langle\rho\rangle ‚ü® italic_œÅ ‚ü© is not a physically significant quantity in the standard model. Rigorous extensions of flat space quantum field theory eliminate ‚ü® œÅ ‚ü© delimited-‚ü®‚ü© ùúå \langle\rho\rangle ‚ü® italic_œÅ ‚ü© from their conceptual framework, indicating that it lacks physical significance in the framework of quantum field theory more broadly. This result has consequences for problems in cosmology and quantum gravity, as it suggests that the correct solution to the cosmological constant problem involves a revision of the vacuum concept within quantum field theory.	
 Online Body Schema Adaptation through Cost-Sensitive Active Learning	Gonalo CunhastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Pedro VicentestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alexandre BernardinostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ricardo RibeirostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Plinio MorenostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Humanoid robots have complex bodies and kinematic chains with several Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) which are difficult to model. Learning the parameters of a kinematic model can be achieved by observing the position of the robot links during prospective motions and minimising the prediction errors. This work proposes a movement efficient approach for estimating online the body-schema of a humanoid robot arm in the form of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. A cost-sensitive active learning approach based on the A-Optimality criterion is used to select optimal joint configurations. The chosen joint configurations simultaneously minimise the error in the estimation of the body schema and minimise the movement between samples. This reduces energy consumption, along with mechanical fatigue and wear, while not compromising the learning accuracy. The work was implemented in a simulation environment, using the 7DoF arm of the iCub robot simulator. The hand pose is measured with a single camera via markers placed in the palm and back of the robot‚Äôs hand. A non-parametric occlusion model is proposed to avoid choosing joint configurations where the markers are not visible, thus preventing worthless attempts. The results show cost-sensitive active learning has similar accuracy to the standard active learning approach, while reducing in about half the executed movement.	
 Dynamic cyber risk estimation with Competitive Quantile Autoregression	Raisa Dzhamtyrova, Carsten Maple	None	None	The increasing value of data held in enterprises makes it an attractive target to attackers. The increasing likelihood and impact of a cyber attack have highlighted the importance of effective cyber risk estimation. We propose two methods for modelling Value-at-Risk (VaR) which can be used for any time-series data. The first approach is based on Quantile Autoregression (QAR), which can estimate VaR for different quantiles, i. e. confidence levels. The second method, we term Competitive Quantile Autoregression (CQAR), dynamically re-estimates cyber risk as soon as new data becomes available. This method provides a theoretical guarantee that it asymptotically performs as well as any QAR at any time point in the future. We show that these methods can predict the size and inter-arrival time of cyber hacking breaches by running coverage tests. The proposed approaches allow to model a separate stochastic process for each significance level and therefore provide more flexibility compared to previously proposed techniques. We provide a fully reproducible code used for conducting the experiments.

 Applications of Clustering with Mixed Type Data in Life Insurance	Shuang Yin, Guojun Gan, Emiliano Valdez, Jeyaraj Vadiveloo	None	None	Death benefits are generally the largest cash flow item that affects financial statements of life insurers where some still do not have a systematic process to track and monitor death claims experience. In this article, we explore data clustering to examine and understand how actual death claims differ from expected, an early stage of developing a monitoring system crucial for risk management. We extend the k ùëò k italic_k -prototypes clustering algorithm to draw inference from a life insurance dataset using only the insured‚Äôs characteristics and policy information without regard to known mortality. This clustering has the feature to efficiently handle categorical, numerical, and spatial attributes. Using gap statistics, the optimal clusters obtained from the algorithm are then used to compare actual to expected death claims experience of the life insurance portfolio. Our empirical data contains observations, during 2014, of approximately 1.14 million policies with a total insured amount of over 650 billion dollars. For this portfolio, the algorithm produced three natural clusters, with each cluster having a lower actual to expected death claims but with differing variability. The analytical results provide management a process to identify policyholders‚Äô attributes that dominate significant mortality deviations, and thereby enhance decision making for taking necessary actions.	
 HexCNN: A Framework for Native Hexagonal Convolutional Neural Networks	Yunxiang Zhao, Qiuhong Ke, Flip Korn, Jianzhong Qi, Rui Zhang	None	None	Hexagonal CNN models have shown superior performance in applications such as IACT data analysis and aerial scene classification due to their better rotation symmetry and reduced anisotropy. In order to realize hexagonal processing, existing studies mainly use the ZeroOut method to imitate hexagonal processing, which causes substantial memory and computation overheads. We address this deficiency with a novel native hexagonal CNN framework named HexCNN . HexCNN takes hexagon-shaped input and performs forward and backward propagation on the original form of the input based on hexagon-shaped filters, hence avoiding computation and memory overheads caused by imitation. For applications with rectangle-shaped input but require hexagonal processing, HexCNN can be applied by padding the input into hexagon-shape as preprocessing. In this case, we show that the time and space efficiency of HexCNN still outperforms existing hexagonal CNN methods substantially. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art models, which imitate hexagonal processing but using rectangle-shaped filters, HexCNN reduces the training time by up to 42.2%.

 Artificial Intelligence for Satellite Communication: A Review	FaresFourati,MohamedSlimAlouini	None	None	Satellite communication offers the prospect of service continuity over uncovered and under-covered areas, service ubiquity, and service scalability. However, several challenges must first be addressed to realize these benefits, as the resource management, network control, network security, spectrum management, and energy usage of satellite networks are more challenging than that of terrestrial networks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has been steadily growing as a research field and has shown successful results in diverse applications, including wireless communication. In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects have demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms. Several challenges facing diverse aspects of satellite communication systems are then discussed, and their proposed and potential AI-based solutions are presented. Finally, an outlook of field is drawn, and future steps are suggested.

 Untargeted Poisoning Attack Detection in Federated Learning via Behavior Attestation	RanwaAlMallah,DavidLpez, GodwinBaduMarfo, andBilalFarooq	None	None	Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm in Machine Learning (ML) that addresses data privacy, security, access rights and access to heterogeneous information issues by training a global model using distributed nodes. Despite its advantages, there is an increased potential for cyberattacks on FL-based ML techniques that can undermine the benefits. Model-poisoning attacks on FL target the availability of the model. The adversarial objective is to disrupt the training. We propose attestedFL, a defense mechanism that monitors the training of individual nodes through state persistence in order to detect a malicious worker . A fine-grained assessment of the history of the worker permits the evaluation of its behavior in time and results in innovative detection strategies. We present three lines of defense that aim at assessing if the worker is reliable by observing if the node is truly training, while advancing towards a goal. Our defense exposes an attacker‚Äôs malicious behavior and removes unreliable nodes from the aggregation process so that the FL process converge faster. attestedFL increased the accuracy of the model in different FL settings, under different attacking patterns, and scenarios e.g., attacks performed at different stages of the convergence, colluding attackers, and continuous attacks.	
 Sampling a Near Neighbor in High Dimensions	Martin Aumller, Sariel HarPeled, Sepideh Mahabadi, Rasmus Pagh, Francesco Silvestri	maau@itu.dk	None	Similarity search is a fundamental algorithmic primitive, widely used in many computer science disciplines. Given a set of points S ùëÜ S italic_S and a radius parameter r > 0 ùëü 0 r>0 italic_r > 0 , the r ùëü r italic_r -near neighbor ( r ùëü r italic_r -NN) problem asks for a data structure that, given any query point q ùëû q italic_q , returns a point p ùëù p italic_p within distance at most r ùëü r italic_r from q ùëû q italic_q . In this paper, we study the r ùëü r italic_r -NN problem in the light of individual fairness and providing equal opportunities: all points that are within distance r ùëü r italic_r from the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the theoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does not provide such a fairness guarantee.

 A characterization of length-factorial Krull monoids	Alfred Geroldinger and Qinghai Zhong	alfred.geroldinger@uni-graz.at, qinghai.zhong@uni-graz.at	University of Graz, NAWI GrazInstitute for Mathematics and Scientific ComputingHeinrichstra√üe 368010 Graz, Austria	An atomic monoid is length-factorial if each two distinct factorizations of any element have distinct factorization lengths.

 Reparameterization Dependence is Useful for Holographic Complexity	Ayoub Mounim, Wolfgang Mck	None	None	Holographic complexity in the ‚Äúcomplexity equals action‚Äù approach is reconsidered relaxing the requirement of reparameterization invariance of the action with the prescription that the action vanish in any static, vacuum causal diamond. This implies that vacuum anti-de Sitter space plays the role of the reference state. Moreover, the complexity of an anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild black hole becomes intrinsically finite and saturates Lloyd‚Äôs bound after a critical time. It is also argued that several artifacts, such as the unphysical negative-time interval, can be removed by truly considering the bulk dual of the thermofield double state.	
 Andrews-Beck type Congruences related to the Crank of a Partition	Shreejit Bandyopadhyay	None	None	In this paper, we discuss a few recent conjectures made by George Beck related to the ranks and cranks of partitions. The conjectures for the rank of a partition were proved by Andrews by using results due to Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer on a suitable generating function, while the conjectures related to cranks were studied by Shane Chern using weighted partition moments. We revisit the conjectures on the crank of a partition by decomposing the relevant generating function and further explore connections with Apple-Lerch series and tenth order mock theta functions.	
 \colorblue Co‚ÇÇFeAl full Heusler compound based spintronic terahertz emitter	Rahul Gupta, Sajid Husain, Ankit Kumar, Rimantas Brucas, Anders Rydberg, Peter Svedlindh	rahul.gupta@angstrom.uu.se; rahulguptaphy@gmail.com	None	To achieve a large terahertz (THz) amplitude from a spintronic THz emitter (STE), materials with 100% spin polarisation such as Co-based Heusler compounds as the ferromagnetic layer are required. However, these compounds are known to loose their half-metallicity in the ultrathin film regime, as it is difficult to achieve L2 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ordering, which has become a bottleneck for the film growth. Here, the successful deposition using room temperature DC sputtering of the L2 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and B2 ordered phases of the Co 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT FeAl full Heusler compound is reported. Co 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT FeAl is used as ferromagnetic layer together with highly orientated Pt as non-ferromagnetic layer in the Co 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT FeAl/Pt STE, where an MgO(10 nm) seed layer plays an important role to achieve the L2 1 1 {}_{1} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and B2 ordering of Co 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT FeAl. The generation of THz radiation in the CFA/Pt STE is presented, which has a bandwidth in the range of 0.1-4 THz. The THz electric field amplitude is optimized with respect to thickness, orientation, and growth parameters using a thickness dependent model considering the optically induced spin current, superdiffusive spin current, inverse spin Hall effect and the attenuation of THz radiation in the layers. This study, based on the full Heusler Co 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT FeAl compound opens up a plethora possibilities in STE research involving full Heusler compounds.

 Nondiscriminatory Treatment: a straightforward framework for multi-human parsing	Min Yan, Guoshan Zhang, Tong Zhang, Yuemin Zhang	None	School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, 300072 Tianjin, China	Multi-human parsing aims to segment every body part of every human instance. Nearly all state-of-the-art methods follow the ‚Äúdetection first‚Äù or ‚Äúsegmentation first‚Äù pipelines. Different from them, we present an end-to-end and box-free pipeline from a new and more human-intuitive perspective. In training time, we directly do instance segmentation on humans and parts. More specifically, we introduce a notion of ‚Äúindiscriminate objects with categories‚Äù which treats humans and parts without distinction and regards them both as instances with categories. In the mask prediction, each binary mask is obtained by a combination of prototypes shared among all human and part categories. In inference time, we design a brand-new grouping post-processing method that relates each part instance with one single human instance and groups them together to obtain the final human-level parsing result. We name our method as Nondiscriminatory Treatment between Humans and Parts for Human Parsing (NTHP). Experiments show that our network performs superiorly against state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the MHP v2.0 and PASCAL-Person-Part datasets.	
 Learning-Based Patch-Wise Metal Segmentation with Consistency Check	TristanMGottschalk,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, AndreasMaier,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, FlorianKordon,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, BjrnWKreherstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Metal implants that are inserted into the patient‚Äôs body during trauma interventions cause heavy artifacts in 3D X-ray acquisitions. Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) methods, whose first step is always a segmentation of the present metal objects, try to remove these artifacts. Thereby, the segmentation is a crucial task which has strong influence on the MAR‚Äôs outcome. This study proposes and evaluates a learning-based patch-wise segmentation network and a newly proposed Consistency Check as post-processing step. The combination of the learned segmentation and Consistency Check reaches a high segmentation performance with an average IoU score of 0.924 on the test set. Furthermore, the Consistency Check proves the ability to significantly reduce false positive segmentations whilst simultaneously ensuring consistent segmentations.

 I Beg to Differ: A study of constructive disagreement in online conversations	Christine De Kock University of CambridgeDepartment of Computer Science and Technology	None	None	Disagreements are pervasive in human communication. In this paper we investigate what makes disagreement constructive. To this end, we construct WikiDisputes, a corpus of 7 425 Wikipedia Talk page conversations that contain content disputes, and define the task of predicting whether disagreements will be escalated to mediation by a moderator. We evaluate feature-based models with linguistic markers from previous work, and demonstrate that their performance is improved by using features that capture changes in linguistic markers throughout the conversations, as opposed to averaged values. We develop a variety of neural models and show that taking into account the structure of the conversation improves predictive accuracy, exceeding that of feature-based models. We assess our best neural model in terms of both predictive accuracy and uncertainty by evaluating its behaviour when it is only exposed to the beginning of the conversation, finding that model accuracy improves and uncertainty reduces as models are exposed to more information.

         University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA"	None	The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS ) mission measured light from stars in ~ 75% of the sky throughout its two year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast data trove for transit signals, we aim to provide an approach that both is computationally efficient and produces highly performant predictions. This approach minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network, which we train to identify planetary transit signals and dismiss false positives. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior transit parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~ 5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present 181 new planet candidates identified by our network, which pass subsequent human vetting designed to rule out false positives. Our neural network model is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.	
 A Blockchain-based Trust System for Decentralised Applications: When trustless needs trust	Nguyen Truong, Gyu Myoung Lee, Kai Sun, Florian Guitton, YiKe Guo	None	Data Science Institute, South Kensington Campus, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom	Blockchain technology has been envisaged to commence an era of decentralised applications and services (DApps) without the need for a trusted intermediary. Such DApps open a marketplace in which services are delivered to end-users by contributors which are then incentivised by cryptocurrencies in an automated, peer-to-peer, and trustless fashion. However, blockchain, consolidated by smart contracts, only ensures on-chain data security, autonomy and integrity of the business logic execution defined in smart contracts. It cannot guarantee the quality of service of DApps, which entirely depends on the services‚Äô performance. Thus, there is a critical need for a trust system to reduce the risk of dealing with fraudulent counterparts in a blockchain network. These reasons motivate us to develop a fully decentralised trust framework deployed on top of a blockchain platform, operating along with DApps in the marketplace to demoralise deceptive entities while encouraging trustworthy ones. The trust system works as an underlying decentralised service providing a feedback mechanism for end-users and maintaining trust relationships among them in the ecosystem accordingly. We believe this research fortifies the DApps ecosystem by introducing an universal trust middleware for DApps as well as shedding light on the implementation of a decentralised trust system.

 The Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule up to ùí™‚Å¢(ùõº_ùë†‚Å¥)-order QCD corrections	XuDong Huang, XingGang Wu, Qing Yu, XuChang Zheng, Jun Zeng	hxud@cqu.edu.cn	None	In the paper, we analyze the properties of Gross-Llewellyn Smith (GLS) sum rule by using the ùí™ ( Œ± s 4 ) ùí™ superscript subscript ùõº ùë† 4 \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^{4}) caligraphic_O ( italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) -order QCD corrections with the help of principle of maximum conformality (PMC). By using the PMC single-scale approach, we obtain an accurate renormalization scale-and-scheme independent fixed-order pQCD contribution for GLS sum rule, e.g. S GLS ( Q 0 2 = 3 G e V 2 ) | PMC = 2.559 ‚àí 0.024 + 0.023 evaluated-at superscript ùëÜ GLS superscript subscript ùëÑ 0 2 3 G e superscript V 2 PMC subscript superscript 2.559 0.023 0.024 S^{\rm GLS}(Q_{0}^{2}=3{\rm GeV}^{2})|_{\rm PMC}=2.559^{+0.023}_{-0.024} italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_GLS end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = 3 roman_G roman_e roman_V start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) | start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PMC end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 2.559 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 0.023 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 0.024 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , where the error is squared average of those from Œî Œ± s ( M Z ) Œî subscript ùõº ùë† subscript ùëÄ ùëç \Delta\alpha_{s}(M_{Z}) roman_Œî italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , the predicted ùí™ ( Œ± s 5 ) ùí™ superscript subscript ùõº ùë† 5 \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^{5}) caligraphic_O ( italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) -order terms predicted by using the Pad√© approximation approach. After applying the PMC, a more convergent pQCD series has been obtained, and the contributions from the unknown higher-order terms are highly suppressed. In combination with the nonperturbative high-twist contribution, our final prediction of GLS sum rule agrees well with the experimental data given by the CCFR collaboration.

 Geometry and arithmetic of integrable hierarchies of KdV type. I.

Moreover, we find that the all-genera invariants themselves coincide with the coefficients of the unique calibration of the Frobenius manifold of ùî§ ùî§ {\mathfrak{g}} fraktur_g -type evaluated at a special point. For the A 4 subscript ùê¥ 4 A_{4} italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (5-spin) case we also find two other normalizations of the sequence that are again integral and of at most exponential growth, and hence conjecturally are the Taylor coefficients of some period functions.	
 Thermodynamics of ùëë-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in the canonical ensemble	Rui Andr, Jos Lemos	rui.andre@tecnico.ulisboa.pt	None	We study the thermodynamics of a d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, also known as a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole, in the canonical ensemble. This generalizes York‚Äôs formalism, which has been initially applied to four dimensions and later to five dimensions, to any number d ùëë d italic_d of dimensions. The canonical ensemble, characterized by a cavity of fixed radius r ùëü r italic_r and fixed temperature T ùëá T italic_T at the boundary, allows for two possible black hole solutions in thermal equilibrium, a smaller black hole and a larger black hole. In four and five dimensions, these solutions have a direct exact form, whereas in an arbitrary number of dimensions, one is compelled to resort to approximation schemes or numerical calculations. From the Euclidean action and the path integral approach, we obtain the free energy, the thermodynamic energy, the thermodynamic pressure, and the entropy, of the black hole plus cavity system. The entropy of the system is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. The analysis of the heat capacity of the system shows that the smaller black hole is in unstable equilibrium and the larger black hole is in stable equilibrium. The d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional photon sphere radius divides the stability criterion. Indeed, if the cavity‚Äôs radius is larger than the photon sphere radius, and so the black hole is small, the system is unstable, if the cavity‚Äôs radius is smaller than the photon sphere radius, and so the black hole is large, the system is stable. To study perturbations on the system, a generalized free energy function is obtained that also allows one to understand the possible phase transitions between classical hot flat space and the black holes. The Buchdahl radius, that appears naturally in the general relativistic study of star structure, also shows up in our context, the free energy is zero when the cavity‚Äôs radius has the d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional Buchdahl radius value. Then, if the cavity‚Äôs radius is larger than the Buchdahl radius, classical hot flat space phase cannot make a phase transition to a black hole phase, and if smaller, classical hot flat space can nucleate a black hole. The roles of both the photon sphere and the Buchdahl limit are present for every dimension d ùëë d italic_d , indicating that, besides their known role in dynamics, these radii also play a role in the thermodynamics of gravitational systems. The close link between the canonical analysis performed and the direct perturbation of the path integral is also pointed out. Since hot flat space is a quantum system made purely of gravitons, if only gravitation is considered, it is of great interest to compare the d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional free energies of quantum hot flat space and the stable black hole to find for which ranges of r ùëü r italic_r and T ùëá T italic_T , the quantities that characterize the canonical ensemble, one phase predominates over the other. Phase diagrams for a few different dimensions are displayed. The density of states at a given energy is found through an inverse Laplace transformation giving back the entropy of the stable black hole. Several side calculations and further deliberations are performed, namely, the calculation for the approximate expressions for the canonical ensemble black hole horizon radii, a brief study of the photon orbit radius and the Buchdahl radius in the d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional Schwarzschild solution, a connection to the thermodynamics of thin shells in d ùëë d italic_d spacetime dimensions which are systems that are also apt to a rigorous thermodynamic study, a presentation of quantum hot flat space in d ùëë d italic_d spacetime dimensions as a thermodynamic system, an analysis of classical hot flat space in d ùëë d italic_d spacetime dimensions as a product of quantum hot flat space with the black hole transitions and the corresponding phase diagrams for a few different dimensions, and a synopsis with the relevance of the work. It is still worth mentioning that the comparison of the thermodynamics of d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and classical hot flat space in the canonical ensemble with the thermodynamics of spherical thin shells in d ùëë d italic_d dimensions yields a striking direct matching between the two systems, most notably that the photon sphere radius appears here as a thermodynamic stability divisor in both systems, and the Buchdahl radius that appears on thermodynamic grounds for canonical black holes appears also as a thermodynamic and as a dynamical radius for thin shells.

For this inference, we use the local star formation histories to estimate the age for each supernova (SN). These star formation histories often show multiple bursts of star formation; our model assumes that one burst is associated with the SN progenitor and the others are random bursts of star formation. The primary inference is the progenitor age distribution. Due to the limited number of historic SNe and highly uncertain star formation at young ages, we restrict our inference to the slope of the age distribution and the maximum age for CCSNe. Using single-star evolutionary models, we transform the progenitor age distribution into a progenitor mass distribution. Under these assumptions, the minimum mass for CCSNe is M min = 8.60 ‚àí 0.41 + 0.37 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ min subscript superscript 8.60 0.37 0.41 subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\textrm{min}}~{}=~{}8.60^{+0.37}_{-0.41}\ M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT min end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 8.60 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 0.37 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 0.41 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is Œ± = ‚àí 2.61 ‚àí 1.18 + 1.05 ùõº subscript superscript 2.61 1.05 1.18 \alpha=-2.61^{+1.05}_{-1.18} italic_Œ± = - 2.61 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 1.05 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 1.18 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . The power-law slope for the progenitor mass distribution is consistent with the standard Salpeter initial mass function ( Œ± = ‚àí 2.35 ùõº 2.35 \alpha=-2.35 italic_Œ± = - 2.35 ). These values are consistent with previous estimates using precursor imaging and the age-dating technique, further confirming that using stellar populations around SN and supernova remnants is a reliable way to infer the progenitor masses.

However, recent observations questioned this result by showing only low-mass structures or no structure at all. We use Adaptative Mesh Refinement hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies with parsec-scale resolution to study the formation of structures inside clumpy high-redshift galaxies.

Those massive structures are similar in mass and size to the giant clumps observed in imaging surveys, in particular with the Hubble Space Telescope. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies, we show that at very high resolution with instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array or through gravitational lensing, only low-mass structures are likely to be detected, and their gathering into giant complexes might be missed. This leads to the non-detection of the giant clumps and therefore introduces a bias in the detection of these structures. We show that the simulated giant clumps can be gravitationally bound even when undetected in mocks representative for ALMA observations and HST observations of lensed galaxies. We then compare the top-down fragmentation of an initially warm disc and the bottom-up fragmentation of an initially cold disc to show that the process of formation of the clumps does not impact their physical properties.

 Anomalies in the gravitational recoil of eccentric black-hole mergers with unequal mass ratios	Miren Radia, Ulrich Sperhake, Emanuele Berti, Robin Croft	m.r.radia@damtp.cam.ac.uk	None	The radiation of linear momentum imparts a recoil (or ‚Äúkick‚Äù) to the center of mass of a merging black-hole binary system. Recent numerical relativity calculations have shown that eccentricity can lead to an approximate 25% increase in recoil velocities for equal-mass, spinning binaries with spins lying in the orbital plane (‚Äúsuperkick‚Äù configurations) [U. Sperhake et al. Phys. Rev. D 101 (2020) 024044 ]. Here we investigate the impact of nonzero eccentricity on the kick magnitude and gravitational-wave emission of nonspinning, unequal-mass black hole binaries. We confirm that nonzero eccentricities at merger can lead to kicks which are larger by up to ‚àº 25 % similar-to absent percent 25 \sim 25\,\% ‚àº 25 % relative to the quasicircular case. We also find that the kick velocity v ùë£ v italic_v has an oscillatory dependence on eccentricity, which we interpret as a consequence of changes in the angle between the infall direction at merger and the apoapsis (or periapsis) direction.	
 Explaining Excess Dipole in NVSS Data Using Superhorizon Perturbation	Kaustav Das, Kishan Sankharva, Pankaj Jain	None	None	Many observations in recent times have shown evidence against the standard assumption of isotropy in the Big Bang model. Introducing a superhorizon scalar metric perturbation has been able to explain some of these anomalies. In this work, we probe the net velocity arising due to the perturbation. We find that this extra component does not contribute to the CMB dipole amplitude while it does contribute to the dipole in large scale structures. Thus, within this model‚Äôs framework, our velocity with respect to the large scale structure is not the same as that extracted from the CMB dipole, assuming it to be of purely kinematic origin. Taking this extra velocity component into account, we study the superhorizon mode‚Äôs implications for the excess dipole observed in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We find that the mode can consistently explain both the CMB and NVSS observations. We also find that the model leads to small contributions to the local bulk flow and the dipole in Hubble parameter, which are consistent with observations. The model leads to several predictions which can be tested in future surveys. In particular, it implies that the observed dipole in large scale structure should be redshift dependent and should show an increase in amplitude with redshift. We also find that the Hubble parameter should show a dipole anisotropy whose amplitude must increase with redshift in the CMB frame. Similar anisotropic behaviour is expected for the observed redshift as a function of the luminosity distance.	
 Measuring time delays: I. Using a flux time series that is a linear combination of time-shifted light curves	Ofer Springer,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTEran OfekstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, IsraelstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTBenin School of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel	None	None	Several phenomena in astrophysics generate light curves with time delays. Among these are reverberation mapping, and lensed quasars. In some of these systems, the measurement of the time-delay is complicated by the fact that the delayed components are unresolved and that the light curves are generated from a red-noise process. We derive the likelihood function of the observations given a model of either a combination of time-delayed light curves or a single light curve (i.e., the null hypothesis). This likelihood function is different from the auto-correlation function investigated by previous studies. We demonstrate that given a single-band light curve that is a linear combination of two (or more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve, generated from a red-noise probability distribution, it is possible to test if the total-flux light curve is a composition of time-delayed copies or, alternatively, is consistent with being a single copy of the original light curve. We also demonstrate that, in some realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and flux ratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is about 1 / 10 1 10 1/10 1 / 10 . In the era of synoptic sky surveys, this method is useful for identifying lensed quasars and simultaneously measuring their time delays, and also for estimating the reverberation time scales of active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper, we build on these results to derive another method that uses the center-of-light astrometric position (e.g., of a lensed quasar) along with the combined flux. The combined flux and astrometry allow us to identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their time delays, with potentially higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method described in the current work. The astrometry + + + flux method, however, is not suitable for quasar reverberation mapping. We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting a power-law model to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such a fit. We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and MATLAB implementations.	
 Accurate and Efficient Simulations of Hamiltonian Mechanical Systems with Discontinuous Potentials	Molei Tao, Shi Jin	None	None	This article considers Hamiltonian mechanical systems with potential functions admitting jump discontinuities. The focus is on accurate and efficient numerical approximations of their solutions, which will be defined via the laws of reflection and refraction. Despite of the success of symplectic integrators for smooth mechanical systems, their construction for the discontinuous ones is nontrivial, and numerical convergence order can be impaired too. Several rather-usable numerical methods are proposed, including: a first-order symplectic integrator for general problems, a third-order symplectic integrator for problems with only one linear interface, arbitrarily high-order reversible integrators for general problems (no longer symplectic), and an adaptive time-stepping version of the previous high-order method. Interestingly, whether symplecticity leads to favorable long time performance is no longer clear due to discontinuity, as traditional Hamiltonian backward error analysis does not apply any more. Therefore, at this stage, our recommended default method is the last one. Various numerical evidence, on the order of convergence, long time performance, momentum map conservation, and consistency with the computationally-expensive penalty method, are supplied. A complex problem, namely the Sauteed Mushroom, is also proposed and numerically investigated, for which multiple bifurcations between trapped and ergodic dynamics are observed.	
 Twin Higgs Portal Dark Matter	David Curtin, Shayne Gryba	None	None	Many minimal models of dark matter (DM) or canonical solutions to the hierarchy problem are either excluded or severely constrained by LHC and direct detection null results. In particular, Higgs Portal Dark Matter (HPDM) features a scalar coupling to the Higgs via a quartic interaction, and obtaining the measured relic density via thermal freeze-out gives definite direct detection predictions which are now almost entirely excluded. The Twin Higgs solves the little hierarchy problem without coloured top partners by introducing a twin sector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a discrete symmetry. We generalize HPDM to arbitrary Twin Higgs models and introduce Twin Higgs Portal Dark Matter (THPDM), which features a DM candidate with an S U ( 4 ) ùëÜ ùëà 4 SU(4) italic_S italic_U ( 4 ) -invariant quartic coupling to the Twin Higgs scalar sector. Given the size of quadratic corrections to the DM mass, its most motivated scale is near the mass of the radial mode. In that case, DM annihilation proceeds with the full Twin Higgs portal coupling, while direct detection is suppressed by the pNGB nature of the 125 GeV Higgs. For a standard cosmological history, this results in a predicted direct detection signal for THPDM that is orders of magnitude below that of HPDM with very little dependence on the precise details of the twin sector, evading current bounds but predicting possible signals at next generation experiments. In many Twin Higgs models, twin radiation contributions to Œî N eff Œî subscript ùëÅ eff \Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}} roman_Œî italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are suppressed by an asymmetric reheating mechanism. We study this by extending the ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ MTH and X ùëã X italic_X MTH models to include THPDM and compute the viable parameter space according to the latest CMB bounds. The injected entropy dilutes the DM abundance as well, resulting in additional suppression of direct detection below the neutrino floor.	
 Supervised quantum machine learning models are kernel methods	Maria Schuld	None	None	With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a supervised machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such ‚Äúquantum models‚Äù are sometimes called ‚Äúquantum neural networks‚Äù, it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises and extends the idea of systematically rephrasing supervised quantum models as a kernel method. With this, a lot of near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. Kernel-based training is then guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.	
 Explaining the scatter in the galaxy mass-metallicity relation with gas flows	Maria van LoonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Peter MitchellstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Joop SchayestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTLeiden Observatory, Leiden University, PO Box , RA Leiden, the Netherlands	None	None	The physical origin of the scatter in the relation between galaxy stellar mass and the metallicity of the interstellar medium, i.e. the Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR), reflects the relative importance of key processes in galaxy evolution. The eagle cosmological hydrodynamical simulation is used to investigate the correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals of the relations between stellar mass and, respectively, specific inflow, outflow and star formation rate as well as the gas fraction for central galaxies. At low redshift, all these residuals are found to be anti-correlated with the residuals of the MZR for M ‚ãÜ / M ‚äô ‚â≤ 10 10 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ subscript M direct-product superscript 10 10 M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\lesssim 10^{10} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . The correlations between the residuals of the MZR and the residuals of the other relations with mass are interrelated, but we find that gas fraction, specific inflow rate and specific outflow rate all have at least some independent influence on the scatter of the MZR. We find that, while for M ‚ãÜ / M ‚äô > 10 10.4 subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ subscript M direct-product superscript 10 10.4 M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}>10^{10.4} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10.4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT the specific mass of the nuclear black hole is most important, for M ‚ãÜ / M ‚äô ‚â≤ 10 10.3 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ subscript M direct-product superscript 10 10.3 M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\lesssim 10^{10.3} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10.3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT gas fraction and specific inflow rate are the variables that correlate most strongly with the MZR scatter.

Most famously, the ‚ÄúG-dwarf problem‚Äù highlighted the small number of low-metallicity G-dwarf stars in the Milky Way, which is inconsistent with the simplest picture of a galaxy formed from a ‚Äúclosed box‚Äù of gas. It can be resolved by treating the Galaxy as an open system that accretes gas throughout its life. This observation has classically only been made in the Milky Way, but the availability of high-quality spectral data from SDSS-IV MaNGA and the development of new analysis techniques mean that we can now make equivalent measurements for a large sample of spiral galaxies. Our analysis shows that high-mass spirals generically show a similar deficit of low-metallicity stars, implying that the Milky Way‚Äôs history of gas accretion is common. By contrast, low-mass spirals show little sign of a G-dwarf problem, presenting the metallicity distribution that would be expected if such systems evolved as pretty much closed boxes. This distinction can be understood from the differing timescales for star formation in galaxies of differing masses.

 Measuring time delays: II.

The typical image separation of objects lensed by galaxies is of the order of 0.5 ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ superscript 0.5 ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 0.5^{\prime\prime} 0.5 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Therefore, finding the ones with small separations, and measuring their time-delays using ground-based observations is challenging. We suggest a new method to identify lensed quasars and simultaneously measure their time-delays, using seeing-limited synoptic observations in which the lensed quasar images and the lensing galaxy are unresolved. We show that using the light curve of the combined flux, and the astrometric measurements of the center-of-light position of the lensed images, the lensed nature of a quasar can be identified, and its time-delay can be measured. We provide the analytic formalism to do so, taking into account the measurement errors and the fact that the power spectra of quasar light curves is red (i.e., the light curve is highly correlated). We demonstrate our method on simulated data, while its implementation to real data will be presented in future papers. Our simulations suggest that, under reasonable assumptions, the new method can detect unresolved lensed quasars and measure their time delays, even when the image separation is below 0.1 ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ superscript 0.1 ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 0.1^{\prime\prime} 0.1 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , or the flux ratio between the faintest and brightest images is as low as 0.03. Python and MATLAB implementations are provided. In a companion paper, we present a method for measuring the time delay using the combined flux observations. Although the flux-only method is less powerful, it may be useful in cases in which the astrometric information is not relevant (e.g., reverberation mapping).

 The Highest Energy HAWC Sources are Likely Leptonic and Powered by Pulsars	Takahiro Sudoh,, Tim Linden, Dan Hooper	None	None	The HAWC Collaboration has observed gamma rays at energies above 56 TeV from a collection of nine sources. It has been suggested that this emission could be hadronic in nature, requiring that these systems accelerate cosmic-ray protons or nuclei up to PeV-scale energies. In this paper, we instead show that the spectra of these objects favor a leptonic (inverse Compton) origin for their emission. More specifically, the gamma-ray emission from these objects can be straightforwardly accommodated within a model in which ‚àº ùí™ ( 10 % ) similar-to absent ùí™ percent 10 \sim\mathcal{O}(10\%) ‚àº caligraphic_O ( 10 % ) of the host pulsar‚Äôs spindown power is transferred into the acceleration of electrons and positrons with a power-law spectrum that extends to several hundred TeV or higher. The spectral break that is observed among these sources is naturally explained within the context of this simple model, and occurs at the energy where the timescale for energy losses matches the age of the pulsar. In contrast, this spectral feature cannot be straightforwardly accommodated in hadronic scenarios. Furthermore, hadronic models predict that these sources should produce more emission at GeV-scale energies than is observed. In light of these considerations, we conclude that HAWC‚Äôs highest energy sources should be interpreted as TeV halos or pulsar wind nebulae, which produce their emission through inverse Compton scattering, and are powered by the rotational kinetic energy of their host pulsar.	
 Multimessenger constraints on the dark matter interpretation of the Fermi-LAT Galactic center excess	Mattia Di Mauro, Martin Wolfgang Winkler	dimauro.mattia@gmail.com	None	An excess of Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ rays in the data measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in the direction of the Galactic center has been reported in several publications. This excess, labeled as the Galactic center excess (GCE), is detected analyzing the data with different interstellar emission models, point source catalogs and analysis techniques. The characteristics of the GCE, recently measured with unprecedented precision, are all compatible with dark matter particles (DM) annihilating in the main halo of our Galaxy, even if other interpretations are still not excluded. We investigate the DM candidates that fit the observed GCE spectrum and spatial morphology. We assume a simple scenario with DM annihilating into a single channel but we inspect also more complicated models with two and three channels. We perform a search for a Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray flux from a list of 48 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using state-of-the-art estimation of the DM density in these objects. Since we do not find any significant signal from the dSphs, we put upper limits on the annihilation cross section that result to be compatible with the DM candidate that fits the GCE.

 Outflow from super-Eddington flow: where it originates from and how much impact it gives?	Takaaki, Shin, Ken, Tomohisa	kitaki@kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp	None	It is widely believed that super-Eddington accretion flow can produce powerful outflow, but where it originates from and how much mass and energy are carried away to which directions?

 Holographic entanglement negativity and replica symmetry breaking	Xi Dong, XiaoLiang Qi, and Michael Walter	xidong@ucsb.edu	None	Since the work of Ryu and Takayanagi, deep connections between quantum entanglement and spacetime geometry have been revealed. The negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is a useful diagnostic of entanglement. In this paper, we discuss the properties of the associated entanglement negativity and its R√©nyi generalizations in holographic duality. We first review the definition of the R√©nyi negativities, which contain the familiar logarithmic negativity as a special case. We then study these quantities in the random tensor network model and rigorously derive their large bond dimension asymptotics. Finally, we study entanglement negativity in holographic theories with a gravity dual, where we find that R√©nyi negativities are often dominated by bulk solutions that break the replica symmetry. From these replica symmetry breaking solutions, we derive general expressions for R√©nyi negativities and their special limits including the logarithmic negativity. In fixed-area states, these general expressions simplify dramatically and agree precisely with our results in the random tensor network model. This provides a concrete setting for further studying the implications of replica symmetry breaking in holography.	
 Enabling Dataflow Optimization for Quantum Programs	David Ittah, Thomas Hner, Vadym Kliuchnikov, Torsten Hoefler	david.ittah@mail.mcgill.ca	None	We propose an IR for quantum computing that directly exposes quantum and classical data dependencies for the purpose of optimization. The Quantum Intermediate Representation for Optimization (QIRO) consists of two dialects, one input dialect and one that is specifically tailored to enable quantum-classical co-optimization. While the first employs a perhaps more intuitive memory-semantics (quantum operations act as side-effects), the latter uses value-semantics (operations consume and produce states). Crucially, this encodes the dataflow directly in the IR, allowing for a host of optimizations that leverage dataflow analysis. We discuss how to map existing quantum programming languages to the input dialect and how to lower the resulting IR to the optimization dialect. We present a prototype implementation based on MLIR that includes several quantum-specific optimization passes. Our benchmarks show that significant improvements in resource requirements are possible even through static optimization. In contrast to circuit optimization at run time, this is achieved while incurring only a small constant overhead in compilation time, making this a compelling approach for quantum program optimization at application scale.	
 Is a Miracle-less WIMP Ruled out?	Jason Arakawa, Tim MP Tait	None	None	We examine a real electroweak triplet scalar field as dark matter, abandoning the requirement that its relic abundance is determined through freeze out in a standard cosmological history (a situation which we refer to as ‚Äòmiracle-less WIMP‚Äô). We extract the bounds on such a particle from collider searches, searches for direct scattering with terrestrial targets, and searches for the indirect products of annihilation. Each type of search provides complementary information, and each is most effective in a different region of parameter space. LHC searches tend to be highly dependent on the mass of the SU(2) charged partner state, and are effective for very large or very tiny mass splitting between it and the neutral dark matter component. Direct searches are very effective at bounding the Higgs portal coupling, but ineffective once it falls below Œª eff ‚â≤ 10 ‚àí 3 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ùúÜ eff superscript 10 3 \lambda_{\text{eff}}\lesssim 10^{-3} italic_Œª start_POSTSUBSCRIPT eff end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Indirect searches suffer from large astrophysical uncertainties due to the backgrounds and J ùêΩ J italic_J -factors, but do provide key information for ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 100 GeV to TeV masses. Synthesizing the allowed parameter space, this example of WIMP dark matter remains viable, but only in miracle-less regimes.	
 The original Wigner‚Äôs friend paradox within a realist toy model	Matteo Lostaglio, Joseph Bowles	None	None	The original Wigner‚Äôs friend paradox is a gedankenexperiment involving an observer described by an external agent. The paradox highlights the tension between unitary evolution and collapse in quantum theory, and is sometimes taken as requiring a reassessment of the notion of objective reality. In this note however we present a classical toy model in which (i) The contradicting predictions at the heart of the thought experiment are reproduced (ii) Every system is in a well-defined state at all times. The toy model shows how puzzles such as Wigner‚Äôs friend‚Äôs experience of being in a superposition, conflicts between different agents‚Äô descriptions of the experiment, the positioning of the Heisenberg‚Äôs cut and the apparent lack of objectivity of measurement outcomes can be explained within a classical model where there exists an objective state of affairs about every physical system at all times. Within the model, the debate surrounding the original Wigner‚Äôs friend thought experiment and its resolution have striking similarities with arguments concerning the nature of the second law of thermodynamics. The same conclusion however does not apply to more recent extensions of the gedankenexperiment featuring multiple encapsulated observers, and shows that such extensions are indeed necessary avoid simple classical explanations.	
 Adding eccentricity to quasicircular binary-black-hole waveform models	Yoshinta Setyawati, Frank Ohme	None	None	The detection of gravitational-wave signals from coalescing eccentric binary black holes would yield unprecedented information about the formation and evolution of compact binaries in specific scenarios, such as dynamical formation in dense stellar clusters and three-body interactions. The gravitational-wave searches by the ground-based interferometers, LIGO and Virgo, rely on analytical waveform models for binaries on quasicircular orbits. Eccentric merger waveform models are less developed, and only few numerical simulations of eccentric mergers are publicly available, but several eccentric inspiral models have been developed from the Post-Newtonian expansion. Here we present a novel method to convert the dominant quadrupolar mode of any circular analytical binary-black-hole model into an eccentric model. First, using numerical simulations, we examine the additional amplitude and frequency modulations of eccentric signals that are not present in their circular counterparts. Subsequently, we identify suitable analytical descriptions of those modulations and interpolate key parameters from twelve numerical simulations designated as our training dataset. This allows us to reconstruct the modulated amplitude and phase of any waveform up to mass ratio 3 and eccentricity 0.2. We find that the minimum overlap of the new model with numerical simulations is around 0.98 over all of our test dataset that are scaled to a 50M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT black-hole binary starting at 35 Hz with aLIGO A+ design sensitivity.

 Fiery Cores: Bursty and Smooth Star Formation Distributions across Galaxy Centers in Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations	Matthew Orr, Perry Hatchfield, Cara Battersby, Christopher Hayward, Philip Hopkins, Andrew Wetzel, Samantha Benincasa, Sarah Loebman, Mattia Sormani, Ralf Klessen	None	None	We present an analysis of the R ‚â≤ 1.5 less-than-or-similar-to ùëÖ 1.5 R\lesssim 1.5 italic_R ‚â≤ 1.5 kpc core regions of seven simulated Milky Way mass galaxies, from the FIRE-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite, for a finely sampled period ( Œî t = 2.2 Œî ùë° 2.2 \Delta t=2.2 roman_Œî italic_t = 2.2 Myr) of 22 Myr at z ‚âà 0 ùëß 0 z\approx 0 italic_z ‚âà 0 , and compare them with star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface density observations of the Milky Way‚Äôs Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Despite not being tuned to reproduce the detailed structure of the CMZ, we find that four of these galaxies are consistent with CMZ observations at some point during this 22 Myr period. The galaxies presented here are not homogeneous in their central structures, roughly dividing into two morphological classes; (a) several of the galaxies have very asymmetric gas and SFR distributions, with intense (compact) starbursts occurring over a period of roughly 10 Myr, and structures on highly eccentric orbits through the CMZ, whereas (b) others have smoother gas and SFR distributions, with only slowly varying SFRs over the period analyzed. In class (a) centers, the orbital motion of gas and star-forming complexes across small apertures ( R ‚â≤ 150 less-than-or-similar-to ùëÖ 150 R\lesssim 150 italic_R ‚â≤ 150 pc, analogously | l | < 1 ‚àò ùëô superscript 1 |l|<1^{\circ} | italic_l | < 1 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT in the CMZ observations) contributes as much to tracers of star formation/dense gas appearing in those apertures, as the internal evolution of those structures does. These asymmetric/bursty galactic centers can simultaneously match CMZ gas and SFR observations, demonstrating that time-varying star formation can explain the CMZ‚Äôs low star formation efficiency.	
 J√≥nsson groups of various cardinalities	Samuel Corson	sammyc973@gmail.com	School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Fry Building, Woodland Road, Bristol, BS8 1UG, United Kingdom.	A group G ùê∫ G italic_G is J√≥nsson if | H | < | G | ùêª ùê∫ |H|<|G| | italic_H | < | italic_G | whenever H ùêª H italic_H is a proper subgroup of G ùê∫ G italic_G . Using an embedding theorem of Obraztsov it is shown that there exists a J√≥nsson group G ùê∫ G italic_G of infinite cardinality Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ if and only if there exists a J√≥nsson algebra of cardinality Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ . Thus the question as to which cardinals admit a J√≥nsson group is wholly reduced to the well-studied question of which cardinals are not J√≥nsson. As a consequence there exist J√≥nsson groups of arbitrarily large cardinality. Another consequence is that the infinitary edge-orbit conjecture of Babai is true.

 Muppet: Massive Multi-task Representations with Pre-Finetuning	Armen AghajanyanFacebookAnchit GuptaFacebookAkshat ShrivastavaFacebookXilun ChenFacebookLuke ZettlemoyerFacebookSonal GuptaFacebook	None	None	We propose pre-finetuning, an additional large-scale learning stage between language model pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-finetuning is massively multi-task learning (around 50 datasets, over 4.8 million total labeled examples), and is designed to encourage learning of representations that generalize better to many different tasks. We show that pre-finetuning consistently improves performance for pretrained discriminators (e.g. RoBERTa) and generation models (e.g. BART) on a wide range of tasks (sentence prediction, commonsense reasoning, MRC, etc.), while also significantly improving sample efficiency during fine-tuning. We also show that large-scale multi-tasking is crucial; pre-finetuning can hurt performance when few tasks are used up until a critical point (usually above 15) after which performance improves linearly in the number of tasks.

 A Comparison of Approaches to Document-level Machine Translation	Zhiyi Ma Sergey Edunov Michael AuliFacebook AI Research	None	None	Document-level machine translation conditions on surrounding sentences to produce coherent translations. There has been much recent work in this area with the introduction of custom model architectures and decoding algorithms. This paper presents a systematic comparison of selected approaches from the literature on two benchmarks for which document-level phenomena evaluation suites exist. We find that a simple method based purely on back-translating monolingual document-level data performs as well as much more elaborate alternatives, both in terms of document-level metrics as well as human evaluation.	
 Complementary Composite Minimization, Small Gradients in General Norms, and Applications to Regression Problems	Jelena DiakonikolasUniversity of WisconsinMadison, Cristbal GuzmnPontificia Universidad Catlica de Chile	None	None	Composite minimization is a powerful framework in large-scale convex optimization, based on decoupling of the objective function into terms with structurally different properties and allowing for more flexible algorithmic design. In this work, we introduce a new algorithmic framework for complementary composite minimization , where the objective function decouples into a (weakly) smooth and a uniformly convex term. This particular form of decoupling is pervasive in statistics and machine learning, due to its link to regularization.

 Deep Subjecthood: Higher-Order Grammatical Features in Multilingual BERT	Isabel PapadimitriouStanford UniversityEthan ChiStanford UniversityRichard FutrellUniversity of California, IrvineKyle MahowaldUniversity of California, Santa Barbara	None	None	We investigate how Multilingual BERT (mBERT) encodes grammar by examining how the high-order grammatical feature of morphosyntactic alignment (how different languages define what counts as a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù) is manifested across the embedding spaces of different languages. To understand if and how morphosyntactic alignment affects contextual embedding spaces, we train classifiers to recover the subjecthood of mBERT embeddings in transitive sentences (which do not contain overt information about morphosyntactic alignment) and then evaluate them zero-shot on intransitive sentences (where subjecthood classification depends on alignment), within and across languages. We find that the resulting classifier distributions reflect the morphosyntactic alignment of their training languages. Our results demonstrate that mBERT representations are influenced by high-level grammatical features that are not manifested in any one input sentence , and that this is robust across languages. Further examining the characteristics that our classifiers rely on, we find that features such as passive voice, animacy and case strongly correlate with classification decisions, suggesting that mBERT does not encode subjecthood purely syntactically, but that subjecthood embedding is continuous and dependent on semantic and discourse factors, as is proposed in much of the functional linguistics literature. Together, these results provide insight into how grammatical features manifest in contextual embedding spaces, at a level of abstraction not covered by previous work. 1 1 1 We release the code to reproduce our experiments here https://github.com/toizzy/deep-subjecthood

 A Census of Blue Stragglers in Gaia DR2 Open Clusters as a Test of Population Synthesis and Mass Transfer Physics	Emily Leiner, Aaron Geller	None	None	We use photometry and proper motions from Gaia DR2 to determine the blue straggler star (BSS) populations of 16 old (1-10 Gyr), nearby ( d < 3500 ùëë 3500 d<3500 italic_d < 3500 pc) open clusters. We find that the fractional number of BSS compared to RGB stars increases with age, starting near zero at 1 Gyr and flattening to ‚àº 0.35 similar-to absent 0.35 \sim 0.35 ‚àº 0.35 by 4 Gyr. Fitting stellar evolutionary tracks to these BSS, we find that their mass distribution peaks at a few tenths of a solar mass above the main-sequence turnoff. BSS more than 0.5 M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT above the turnoff make up only ‚àº 25 similar-to absent 25 \sim 25 ‚àº 25 % of the sample, and BSS more than 1.0 M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT above the turnoff are rare. We compare this to Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code ( COSMIC ) population synthesis models of BSS formed via mass transfer. We find that standard population synthesis assumptions dramatically under-produce the number of BSS in old open clusters. We also find that these models overproduce high mass BSS relative to lower mass BSS. Expected numbers of BSS formed through dynamics do not fully account for this discrepancy. We conclude that in order to explain the observed BSS populations from Roche lobe oveflow, mass-transfer from giant donors must be more stable than assumed in canonical mass-transfer prescriptions, and including non-conservative mass transfer is important in producing realistic BSS masses. Even with these modifications, it is difficult to achieve the large number of BSS observed in the oldest open clusters. We discuss some additional physics that may explain the large number of observed blue stragglers among old stellar populations.

Johannes Brust, Roummel Marcia, Cosmin Petra, 	jjbrust@ucsd.edu	None	For optimization problems with linear equality constraints, we prove that the (1,1) block of the inverse KKT matrix remains unchanged when projected onto the nullspace of the constraint matrix . We develop reduced compact representations of the limited-memory inverse BFGS Hessian to compute search directions efficiently when the constraint Jacobian is sparse . Orthogonal projections are implemented by a sparse QR factorization or a preconditioned LSQR iteration.

 C-for-Metal: High Performance SIMD Programming on Intel GPUs	GueiYuan Lueh,Kaiyu Chen,Gang Chen,Joel Fuentes,WeiYu Chen,Fangwen Fu,Hong Jiang,Hongzheng Li, andDaniel Rhee	None	None	The SIMT execution model is commonly used for general GPU development. CUDA and OpenCL developers write scalar code that is implicitly parallelized by compiler and hardware. On Intel GPUs, however, this abstraction has profound performance implications as the underlying ISA is SIMD and important hardware capabilities cannot be fully utilized. To close this performance gap we introduce C-For-Metal (CM), an explicit SIMD programming framework designed to deliver close-to-the-metal performance on Intel GPUs. The CM programming language and its vector/matrix types provide an intuitive interface to exploit the underlying hardware features, allowing fine-grained register management, SIMD size control and cross-lane data sharing. Experimental results show that CM applications from different domains outperform the best-known SIMT-based OpenCL implementations, achieving up to 2.7x speedup on the latest Intel GPU.

 Energy Non-Conservation in Quantum Mechanics	Sean CarrollstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Jackie LodmanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We study the conservation of energy, or lack thereof, when measurements are performed in quantum mechanics. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian of a system changes when wave functions collapse in accordance with the standard textbook (Copenhagen) treatment of quantum measurement, but one might imagine that the change in energy is compensated by the measuring apparatus or environment. We show that this is not true; the change in the energy of a state after measurement can be arbitrarily large, independent of the physical measurement process. In Everettian quantum theory, while the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is conserved for the wave function of the universe (including all the branches), it is not constant within individual worlds. It should therefore be possible to experimentally measure violations of conservation of energy, and we suggest an experimental protocol for doing so.	
 Response-Time Analysis and Optimization for Probabilistic Conditional Parallel DAG Tasks	Niklas UeterDortmund, Germanyniklasuetertudortmundde, Mario GnzelDortmund, Germanymarioguenzeltudortmundde, JianJia ChenDortmund, Germanyjianjiachentudortmundde	None	None	Real-time systems increasingly use multicore processors in order to satisfy thermal, power, and computational requirements. To exploit the architectural parallelism offered by the multicore processors, parallel task models, scheduling algorithms and response-time analyses with respect to real-time constraints have to be provided. In this paper, we propose a reservation-based scheduling algorithm for sporadic constrained-deadline parallel conditional DAG tasks with probabilistic execution behaviour for applications that can tolerate bounded number of deadline misses and bounded tardiness. We devise design rules and analyses to guarantee bounded tardiness for a specified bounded probability for k ùëò k italic_k -consecutive deadline misses without enforcing late jobs to be immediately aborted.	
 Remote Learners, Home Makers: How Digital Fabrication Was Taught Online During a Pandemic	Gabrielle Benabdallah, Samuelle Bourgault, Nadya Peek, Jennifer Jacobs	None	None	Digital fabrication courses that relied on physical makerspaces were severely disrupted by COVID-19. As universities shut down in Spring 2020, instructors developed new models for digital fabrication at a distance. Through interviews with faculty and students and examination of course materials, we recount the experiences of eight remote digital fabrication courses. We found that learning with hobbyist equipment and online social networks could emulate using industrial equipment in shared workshops. Furthermore, at-home digital fabrication offered unique learning opportunities including more iteration, machine tuning, and maintenance. These opportunities depended on new forms of labor and varied based on student living situations. Our findings have implications for remote and in-person digital fabrication instruction. They indicate how access to tools was important, but not as critical as providing opportunities for iteration; they show how remote fabrication exacerbated student inequities; and they suggest strategies for evaluating trade-offs in remote fabrication models with respect to learning objectives.	
 LDLE: Low Distortion Local Eigenmaps	Dhruv KohlidhkohliucsdeduDepartment of MathematicsUniversity of California San DiegoCA , USA, Alexander CloningeracloningerucsdeduDepartment of MathematicsUniversity of California San DiegoCA , USA, Gal MishnegmishneucsdeduHaliciolu Data Science InstituteUniversity of California San DiegoCA , USA	None	None	We present Low Distortion Local Eigenmaps (LDLE), a manifold learning technique which constructs a set of low distortion local views of a dataset in lower dimension and registers them to obtain a global embedding. The local views are constructed using the global eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian and are registered using Procrustes analysis. The choice of these eigenvectors may vary across the regions. In contrast to existing techniques, LDLE can embed closed and non-orientable manifolds into their intrinsic dimension by tearing them apart. It also provides gluing instruction on the boundary of the torn embedding to help identify the topology of the original manifold. Our experimental results will show that LDLE largely preserved distances up to a constant scale while other techniques produced higher distortion. We also demonstrate that LDLE produces high quality embeddings even when the data is noisy or sparse.	
 A Model of Densifying Collaboration Networks	Keith Burghardt, Allon Percus, Kristina Lerman	keithab@isi.edu	None	Research collaborations provide the foundation for scientific advances, but we have only recently begun to understand how they form and grow on a global scale. Here we analyze a model of the growth of research collaboration networks to explain the empirical observations that the number of collaborations scales superlinearly with institution size, though at different rates (heterogeneous densification), the number of institutions grows as a power of the number of researchers (Heaps‚Äô law) and institution sizes approximate Zipf‚Äôs law. This model has three mechanisms: (i) researchers are preferentially hired by large institutions, (ii) new institutions trigger more potential institutions, and (iii) researchers collaborate with friends-of-friends. We show agreement between these assumptions and empirical data, through analysis of co-authorship networks spanning two centuries. We then develop a theoretical understanding of this model, which reveals emergent heterogeneous scaling such that the number of collaborations between institutions scale with an institution‚Äôs size.

 Supervised Momentum Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot Classification	Orchid Majumder, Avinash Ravichandran, Subhransu Maji, Alessandro Achille, Marzia Polito, Stefano Soatto	None	None	Few-shot learning aims to transfer information from one task to enable generalization on novel tasks given a few examples. This information is present both in the domain and the class labels. In this work we investigate the complementary roles of these two sources of information by combining instance-discriminative contrastive learning and supervised learning in a single framework called Sup ervised Mo mentum Co ntrastive learning ( SupMoCo ). Our approach avoids a problem observed in supervised learning where information in images not relevant to the task is discarded, which hampers their generalization to novel tasks. We show that (self-supervised) contrastive learning and supervised learning are mutually beneficial, leading to a new state-of-the-art on the Meta-Dataset [ 47 ] ‚Äî a recently introduced benchmark for few-shot learning. Our method is based on a simple modification of MoCo [ 19 ] and scales better than prior work on combining supervised and self-supervised learning. This allows us to easily combine data from multiple domains leading to further improvements.

Our model uses a combination of sparse and dense document representations, aggregates document-cluster similarity along these multiple representations and makes the clustering decision using a neural classifier. The weighted document-cluster similarity model is learned using a novel adaptation of the triplet loss into a linear classification objective. We show that the use of a suitable fine-tuning objective and external knowledge in pre-trained transformer models yields significant improvements in the effectiveness of contextual embeddings for clustering. Our model achieves a new state-of-the-art on a standard stream clustering dataset of English documents.	
 Defenses Against Multi-Sticker Physical Domain Attacks on Classifiers	Xinwei Zhao, Matthew Stamm	None	None	Recently, physical domain adversarial attacks have drawn significant attention from the machine learning community. One important attack proposed by Eykholt et al. can fool a classifier by placing black and white stickers on an object such as a road sign. While this attack may pose a significant threat to visual classifiers, there are currently no defenses designed to protect against this attack. In this paper, we propose new defenses that can protect against multi-sticker attacks. We present defensive strategies capable of operating when the defender has full, partial, and no prior information about the attack. By conducting extensive experiments, we show that our proposed defenses can outperform existing defenses against physical attacks when presented with a multi-sticker attack.	
 Nonergodic dynamics in disorder-free potentials	Ruixiao Yao, Titas Chanda, Jakub Zakrzewski	None	"Department of Physics and State Key Laboratory of Low Dimensional
Quantum Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"	We review the dynamics of interacting particles in disorder-free potentials concentrating on a combination of a harmonic binding with a constant tilt. We show that a simple picture of an effective local tilt describes a variety of cases. Our examples include spinless fermions (as modeled by Heisenberg spin chain in a magnetic field), spinful fermions as well as bosons that enjoy a larger local on-site Hilbert space. We also discuss the domain-wall dynamics that reveals nonergodic features even for a relatively weak tilt as suggested by Doggen et. al. [arXiv:2012.13722]. By adding a harmonic potential on top of the static field we confirm that the surprizing regular dynamics is not entirely due to Hilbert space shuttering. It seems better explained by the inhibited transport within the domains of identically oriented spins. Once the spin-1/2 restrictions are lifted as, e.g., for bosons, the dynamics involve stronger entanglement generation. Again for domain wall melting, the effect of the harmonic potential is shown to lead mainly to an effective local tilt.

 Inhomogeneous mean-field approach to collective excitations near the superfluid-Mott glass transition	Martin Puschmann, Joo Getelina, Jos Hoyos, Thomas Vojta	None	None	We develop an inhomogeneous quantum mean-field approach to the behavior of collective excitations across the superfluid-Mott glass quantum phase transition in two dimensions, complementing recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 027002 (2020)]. In quadratic (Gaussian) approximation, the Goldstone (phase) and Higgs (amplitude) modes completely decouple. Each is described by a disordered Bogoliubov Hamiltonian which can be solved by an inhomogeneous multi-mode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the Higgs mode is spatially localized in both phases. The corresponding scalar spectral function shows a broad peak that is noncritical in the sense that its peak frequency does not soften but remains nonzero across the quantum phase transition. In contrast, the lowest-energy Goldstone mode delocalizes in the superfluid phase, leading to a zero-frequency spectral peak. We compare these findings to the results of the quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We also relate them to general results on the localization of bosonic excitations, and we discuss the limits and generality of our approach.

 The Galactic Chemical Evolution of Chlorine	Maas, Pilachowski	None	None	We measured 35 35 {}^{35} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 35 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Cl abundances in 52 M giants with metallicities between ‚Äì0.5 < < < [Fe/H] < < < 0.12. Abundances and atmospheric parameters were derived using infrared spectra from CSHELL on the IRTF and from optical echelle spectra. We measured Cl abundances by fitting a H 35 35 {}^{35} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 35 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Cl molecular feature at 3.6985 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m with synthetic spectra. We also measured the abundances of O, Ca, Ti, and Fe using atomic absorption lines. We find that the [Cl/Fe] ratio for our stars agrees with chemical evolution models of Cl and the [Cl/Ca] ratio is broadly consistent with the solar ratio over our metallicity range. Both indicate that Cl is primarily made in core-collapse supernovae with some contributions from Type Ia SN. We suggest other potential nucleosynthesis processes, such as the ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ -process, are not significant producers of Cl. Finally, we also find our Cl abundances are consistent with H II and planetary nebular abundances at a given oxygen abundance, although there is scatter in the data.	
 The Neupert Effect of Flare UltraViolet and Soft X-ray Emissions	Jiong Qiu	None	None	We model the Neupert effect that relates flare heating energy with the observed SXR emission. The traditional form of the Neupert effect refers to the correlation between the time-integrated HXR or microwave light curve and the SXR light curve. In this paper, instead, we use as the proxy for heating energy the ultraviolet (UV) emission at the foot-points of flare loops, and modify the model of the Neupert effect by taking into account the discrete nature of flare heating as well as cooling. In the modified empirical model, spatially resolved UV lightcurves from the transition region or upper chromosphere are each convolved with a kernel function characterizing decay of the flare loop emission. Contributions by all loops are summed to compare with the observed total SXR emission. The model has successfully reproduced the observed SXR emission from its rise to decay. To estimate heating energies in flare loops, we also employ the UV Foot-point Calorimeter (UFC) method that infers heating rates in flare loops from these UV light curves and models evolution of flare loops with a zero-dimensional hydrodynamic code. The experiments show that a multitude of impulsive heating events do not well reproduce the observed flare SXR light curve, but a two-phase heating model leads to better agreement with observations. Comparison of the two models of the Neupert effect further allows us to calibrate the UFC method, and improve the estimate of heating rates in flare loops continuously formed by magnetic reconnection throughout the flare evolution.	
 REFORM: Fast and Adaptive Solution for Subteam Replacement	Zhaoheng Li, Xinyu Pi, Mingyuan Wu, Hanghang Tong	None	None	Subteam Replacement : given a team of people embedded in a social network to complete a certain task, and a subset of members (i.e., subteam) in this team which have become unavailable, find another set of people who can perform the subteam‚Äôs role in the larger team. We conjecture that a good candidate subteam should have high skill and structural similarity with the replaced subteam while sharing a similar connection with the larger team as a whole. Based on this conjecture, we propose a novel graph kernel which evaluates the goodness of candidate subteams in this holistic way freely adjustable to the need of the situation. To tackle the significant computational difficulties, we equip our kernel with a fast approximation algorithm which (a) employs effective pruning strategies, (b) exploits the similarity between candidate team structures to reduce kernel computations, and (c) features a solid theoretical bound on the quality of the obtained solution. We extensively test our solution on both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed graph kernel outputs more human-agreeable recommendations compared to metrics used in previous work, and our algorithm consistently outperforms alternative choices by finding near-optimal solutions while scaling linearly with the size of the replaced subteam.

 Index matching computerized tomography	Vincent Daley, Owen Paetkau, Mark Paetkau	None	None	Computerized tomography (CT) has been used for decades by medical professionals to detect and diagnose injuries and ailments. CT scanners are based on interesting physics, but due to their bulk, cost, and safety, hands on experience with a medical CT scanner is unrealistic for undergraduate students. Therefore, operationally similar, yet small, safe, and inexpensive CT scanners are desirable teaching tools. This project details the development of a novel model CT scanning apparatus. The experimental setup presented utilizes visible light, has short data acquisition time, and operates on the same physics as its X-ray counterpart. The apparatus employs a laser and photodiode to image a transparent material, while avoiding loss of transmitted intensity through index of refraction matching. A simple back-projection algorithm results in a 2D cross section of the scan object. We found we could collect data and reliably image samples in 15 minutes.	
 Property Inference from Poisoning	Melissa Chase, Esha Ghosh, Saeed Mahloujifar	None	None	A major concern in training and releasing machine learning models is to what extent the model contains sensitive information that the data holders do not want to reveal. Property inference attacks consider an adversary who has access to the trained model and tries to extract some global statistics of the training data. In this work, we study property inference in scenarios where the adversary can maliciously control part of the training data (poisoning data) with the goal of increasing the leakage.	
 Patient Diversion Across Primary Health Centers Using Real Time Delay Predictors	Najiya FatmastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Varun RamamohanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In the current work, we consider diversion of childbirth patients who arrive seeking emergency admission to public primary health centers (PHCs). PHCs are the first point of contact for an Indian patient with formal medical care, and offer medical care on an outpatient basis, and limited inpatient and childbirth care. In this context, real-time prediction of the wait time of the arriving patient becomes important in order to determine whether the patient must be diverted to another PHC or not. We study this problem using a discrete event simulation that we develop of medical care operations in two PHCs in India. We approximate the labour room service at each PHC as an M/G/1 queueing system and show how the accuracy of real-time delay predictors impacts the extent of the change in operational outcomes at each PHC. We simulate patient diversion using actual delays as well as the delay estimates generated by various delay predictors based on the state of the system such as queue-length, elapsed service time, and observed delay histories. The simulation of the diversion process also incorporates travel time between the PHCs. We also propose a new delay predictor that incorporates information regarding the system state as well as the service time distribution. We compare the operational outcomes at both PHCs without diversion and with diversion using the above delay predictors. We show numerically that more accurate delay predictors lead to more equitable distribution of resources involved in provision of childbirth care across both PHCs.	
 Adaptivity without Compromise: A Momentumized, Adaptive, Dual Averaged Gradient Method for Stochastic Optimization	Aaron DefazioFacebook AI Research, New YorkSamy JelassiPrinceton University, Princeton	None	None	We introduce MADGRAD, a novel optimization method in the family of AdaGrad adaptive gradient methods. MADGRAD shows excellent performance on deep learning optimization problems from multiple fields, including classification and image-to-image tasks in vision, and recurrent and bidirectionally-masked models in natural language processing. For each of these tasks, MADGRAD matches or outperforms both SGD and ADAM in test set performance, even on problems for which adaptive methods normally perform poorly.	
 Broadband terahertz half-wave plate with multi-layers metamaterial via quantum engineering	Wei Huang, Xiaoyuan Hao, Yu Cheng, Shan Yin, Jiaguang Han, Wentao Zhang	None	None	In this paper, we employ the novel design of the metamaterial half-wave plate by using the multiple layers of the metamaterials with some specific rotation angles. The rotation angles are given by composite pulse control which is the well-known quantum control technique. A big advantage of this method can analytically calculate the rotation angles and can be easily extended to the multiple layers. The more layers of the metamaterials can present more bandwidth of half-wave plate. In this paper, we present 1, 3, 5, 7 configurations of layers of a metamaterial half-wave plate and we demonstrate that our device increasingly enhance the bandwidth of performance.	
 New Findings on GLRT Radar Detection of Nonfluctuating Targets via Phased Arrays	Fernando Daro Almeida Garca, Marco Antonio Miguel Miranda and Jos Cndido Silveira Santos Filho	None	None	This paper addresses the standard generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detection problem of weak signals in background noise. In so doing, we consider a nonfluctuating target embedded in complex white Gaussian noise (CWGN), in which the amplitude of the target echo and the noise power are assumed to be unknown. Important works have analyzed the performance for the referred scenario and proposed GLRT-based detectors. Such detectors are projected at an early stage (i.e., prior to the formation of a post-beamforming scalar waveform), thereby imposing high demands on hardware, processing, and data storage. From a hardware perspective, most radar systems fail to meet these strong requirements. In fact, due to hardware and computational constraints, most radars use a combination of analog and digital beamformers (sums) before any estimation or further pre-processing. The rationale behind this study is to derive a GLRT detector that meets the hardware and system requirements. In this work, we design and analyze a more practical and easy-to-implement GLRT detector, which is projected after the analog beamforming. The performance of the proposed detector is analyzed and the probabilities of detection (PD) and false alarm (PFA) are derived in closed form . An alternative fast converging series for the PD is also derived. This series proves to be very efficient and computationally tractable, saving both computation time and computational load. Moreover, we show that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the post-beamforming GLRT detector performs better than both the classic pre-beamforming GLRT detector and the square-law detector. This finding suggests that if the signals are weak, instead of processing the signals separately, we first must to reinforce the overall signal and then assembling the system‚Äôs detection statistic . We also showed that the PFA of the post-beamforming GLRT detector is independent of the number of antennas. This property allows us to improve the PD (by increasing the number of antennas) while maintaining a fixed PFA. At last, the SNR losses are quantified, in which the superiority of the post-beamforming GLRT detector was evidenced as the number of antennas and samples increase.

 Blind Reconstruction of Multilayered Tissue Profiles with UWB Radar Under Bayesian Setting	Burak Cevat Civek andEmre Ertin	None	None	In this paper, we investigate the problem of inverse electromagnetic scattering to recover multilayer human tissue profiles using ultrawideband radar systems in Bayesian setting. We study the recovery problem in blind setting, in which we simultaneously estimate both the dielectric/geometric properties of the one-dimensional target tissue profile and the transmitted radar waveform. To perform Bayesian parameter estimation, we propose a hybrid and adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, which combines the Slice sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approaches. The introduced sampling mechanism also incorporates the Parallel Tempering approach to escape from the local optimal regions of the complex posterior distribution. We provide empirical support through various numerical simulations for the achieved enhanced sampling efficiency compared to conventional sampling schemes. To investigate the recovery performance, we work on synthetic measurements simulating actual radar returns from multilayer tissue profiles. We derive theoretical bounds for the best achievable estimation performance in terms of normalized root mean square error and provide a comparison with the performance of our estimator.	
 Deep Video Inpainting Detection	Peng Zhou, Ning Yu, Zuxuan Wu, Larry Davis, Abhinav Shrivastavaand SerNam Lim	None	1University of Maryland, College Park	This paper studies video inpainting detection, which localizes an inpainted region in a video both spatially and temporally. In particular, we introduce VIDNet, Video Inpainting Detection Network, which contains a two-stream encoder-decoder architecture with attention module. To reveal artifacts encoded in compression, VIDNet additionally takes in Error Level Analysis frames to augment RGB frames, producing multimodal features at different levels with an encoder. Exploring spatial and temporal relationships, these features are further decoded by a Convolutional LSTM to predict masks of inpainted regions. In addition, when detecting whether a pixel is inpainted or not, we present a quad-directional local attention module that borrows information from its surrounding pixels from four directions. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our approach. We demonstrate, among other things, that VIDNet not only outperforms by clear margins alternative inpainting detection methods but also generalizes well on novel videos that are unseen during training.	
 The Effect of Class Definitions on the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks Against Forensic CNNs	Xinwei Zhao and Matthew Stamm Drexel University Philadelphia, PA, xzdrexeledu, mstammcoedrexeledu	None	None	In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used by researchers to perform forensic tasks such as image tampering detection. At the same time, adversarial attacks have been developed that are capable of fooling CNN-based classifiers. Understanding the transferability of adversarial attacks, i.e. an attack‚Äôs ability to attack a different CNN than the one it was trained against, has important implications for designing CNNs that are resistant to attacks. While attacks on object recognition CNNs are believed to be transferrable, recent work by Barni et al. has shown that attacks on forensic CNNs have difficulty transferring to other CNN architectures or CNNs trained using different datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial attacks on forensic CNNs are even less transferrable than previously thought ‚Äì even between virtually identical CNN architectures! We show that several common adversarial attacks against CNNs trained to identify image manipulation fail to transfer to CNNs whose only difference is in the class definitions (i.e. the same CNN architectures trained using the same data). We note that all formulations of class definitions contain the ‚Äúunaltered‚Äù class. This has important implications for the future design of forensic CNNs that are robust to adversarial and anti-forensic attacks.	
 Error-correcting entanglement swapping using a practical logical photon encoding	Paul Hilaire, Edwin Barnes, Sophia Economou, Frdric Grosshans	None	None	Several emerging quantum technologies, including quantum networks, modular and fusion-based quantum computing, rely crucially on the ability to perform photonic Bell state measurements. Therefore, photon losses and the 50% success probablity upper bound of Bell state measurements pose a critical limitation to photonic quantum technologies. Here, we develop protocols that overcome these two key challenges through logical encoding of photonic qubits. Our approach uses a tree graph state logical encoding, which can be produced deterministically with a few quantum emitters, and achieves near-deterministic logical photonic Bell state measurements while also protecting against errors including photon losses, with a record loss-tolerance threshold.	
 Unsupervised tree boosting for learning probability distributions	Naoki Awaya and Li Ma	None	None	We propose an unsupervised tree boosting algorithm for inferring the underlying sampling distribution of an i.i.d. sample based on fitting additive tree ensembles in a fashion analogous to supervised tree boosting. Integral to the algorithm is a new notion of ‚Äúaddition‚Äù on probability distributions that leads to a coherent notion of ‚Äúresidualization‚Äù, i.e., subtracting a probability distribution from an observation to remove the distributional structure from the sampling distribution of the latter. We show that these notions arise naturally for univariate distributions through cumulative distribution function (CDF) transforms and compositions due to several ‚Äúgroup-like‚Äù properties of univariate CDFs. While the traditional multivariate CDF does not preserve these properties, a new definition of multivariate CDF can restore these properties, thereby allowing the notions of ‚Äúaddition‚Äù and ‚Äúresidualization‚Äù to be formulated for multivariate settings as well. This then gives rise to the unsupervised boosting algorithm based on forward-stagewise fitting of an additive tree ensemble, which sequentially reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the truth. The algorithm allows analytic evaluation of the fitted density and outputs a generative model that can be readily sampled from. We enhance the algorithm with scale-dependent shrinkage and a two-stage strategy that separately fits the marginals and the copula. The algorithm then performs competitively to state-of-the-art deep-learning approaches in multivariate density estimation on multiple benchmark datasets.

 EPIC-Survival: End-to-end Part Inferred Clustering for Survival Analysis, Featuring Prognostic Stratification Boosting	Hassan Muhammad, Chensu Xie, Carlie Sigel, Amber Simpson, Michael Doukas, Lindsay Alpert, William Jarnagin, Thomas Fuchs	None	None	Histopathology-based survival modelling has two major hurdles. Firstly, a well-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not contribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk groups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting, individuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather predicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus, It is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups. Secondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach (encoding and aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole slide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to technological constraints on data processing, forcing decoupled learning. EPIC-Survival bridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling approach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to not only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In this study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a historically difficult cancer to model. Further, we show that stratification boosting improves further improves model performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a held-out test set. Finally, we were able to identify specific histologic differences, not commonly sought out in ICC, between low and high risk groups.

Our network can generate these gestures at interactive rates on a commodity GPU. We conduct a web-based user study and observe that around 91% of participants indicated our generated gestures to be at least plausible on a five-point Likert Scale. The emotions perceived by the participants from the gestures are also strongly positively correlated with the corresponding intended emotions, with a minimum Pearson coefficient of 0.77 in the valence dimension.

 Screen2Vec: Semantic Embedding of GUI Screens and GUI Components	Toby JiaJun Li, Lindsay Popowski, Tom Mitchell, Brad Myers	tobyli@cs.cmu.edu	None	Representing the semantics of GUI screens and components is crucial to data-driven computational methods for modeling user-GUI interactions and mining GUI designs. Existing GUI semantic representations are limited to encoding either the textual content, the visual design and layout patterns, or the app contexts. Many representation techniques also require significant manual data annotation efforts. This paper presents Screen2Vec , a new self-supervised technique for generating representations in embedding vectors of GUI screens and components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring manual annotation using the context of user interaction traces. Screen2Vec is inspired by the word embedding method Word2Vec , but uses a new two-layer pipeline informed by the structure of GUIs and interaction traces and incorporates screen- and app-specific metadata. Through several sample downstream tasks, we demonstrate Screen2Vec ‚Äôs key useful properties: representing between-screen similarity through nearest neighbors, composability, and capability to represent user tasks.

 Central moments multiple relaxation time LBM for hemodynamic simulations in intracranial aneurysms: An in-vitro validation study using PIV and PC-MRI	Seyed Ali Hosseini, Philipp Berg, Feng Huang, Christoph Roloff, Gbor Janiga, Dominique Thvenin	seyed.hosseini@ovgu.de	Laboratory of Fluid Dynamics and Technical Flows, University of Magdeburg ‚ÄúOtto von Guericke‚Äù, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany	The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative to classical Navier-Stokes solvers. This is particularly true for hemodynamics in complex geometries. However, in its most basic formulation, i.e. with the so-called single relaxation time (SRT) collision operator, it has been observed to have a limited stability domain in the Courant/Fourier space, strongly constraining the minimum time-step and grid size. The development of improved collision models such as the multiple relaxation time (MRT) operator in central moments space has tremendously widened the stability domain, while allowing to overcome a number of other well-documented artifacts, therefore opening the door for simulations over a wider range of grid and time-step sizes. The present work focuses on implementing and validating a specific collision operator, the central Hermite moments multiple relaxation time model with the full expansion of the equilibrium distribution function, to simulate blood flows in intracranial aneurysms. The study further proceeds with a validation of the numerical model through different test-cases and against experimental measurements obtained via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI). For a patient-specific aneurysm both PIV and PC-MRI agree fairly well with the simulation. Finally, low-resolution simulations were shown to be able to capture blood flow information with sufficient accuracy, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the flow field while leading to strongly reduced computation times. For instance in the case of the patient-specific configuration, increasing the grid-size by a factor of two led to a reduction of computation time by a factor of 14 with very good similarity indices still ranging from 0.83 to 0.88.	
 New Riemannian preconditioned algorithms for tensor completion via polyadic decompositionThis work was supported by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique ‚Äì FNRS and the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek ‚Äì Vlaanderen under EOS Project no. 30468160 (SeLMA ‚Äì Structured low-rank matrix/tensor approximation: numerical optimization-based algorithms and applications). The first author was supported by the FNRS through a FRIA scholarship.	Shuyu Dong, Bin Gao, Yu Guan, Franois Glineur	None	None	We propose new Riemannian preconditioned algorithms for low-rank tensor completion via the polyadic decomposition of a tensor. These algorithms exploit a non-Euclidean metric on the product space of the factor matrices of the low-rank tensor in the polyadic decomposition form. This new metric is designed using an approximation of the diagonal blocks of the Hessian of the tensor completion cost function, thus has a preconditioning effect on these algorithms. We prove that the proposed Riemannian gradient descent algorithm globally converges to a stationary point of the tensor completion problem, with convergence rate estimates using the ≈Åojasiewicz property. Numerical results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the proposed algorithms are more efficient in memory and time compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithms display a greater tolerance for overestimated rank parameters in terms of the tensor recovery performance, thus enable a flexible choice of the rank parameter.	
 First Align, then Predict: Understanding the Cross-Lingual Ability of Multilingual BERT	Benjamin Muller,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTYanai Elazar,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTInria, Paris, FrancestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSorbonne Universit, Paris, FrancestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTComputer Science Department, Bar Ilan UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTAllen Institute for Artificial Intelligence	None	None	Multilingual pretrained language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities. Such transfer emerges by fine-tuning on a task of interest in one language and evaluating on a distinct language, not seen during the fine-tuning. Despite promising results, we still lack a proper understanding of the source of this transfer. Using a novel layer ablation technique and analyses of the model‚Äôs internal representations, we show that multilingual BERT, a popular multilingual language model, can be viewed as the stacking of two sub-networks: a multilingual encoder followed by a task-specific language-agnostic predictor. While the encoder is crucial for cross-lingual transfer and remains mostly unchanged during fine-tuning, the task predictor has little importance on the transfer and can be reinitialized during fine-tuning. We present extensive experiments with three distinct tasks, seventeen typologically diverse languages and multiple domains to support our hypothesis.	
 Autonomous Off-road Navigation over Extreme Terrains with Perceptually-challenging Conditions	Rohan ThakkerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Nikhilesh AlaturstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, David FanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jesus TordesillasstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Michael PatonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Kyohei OtsustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Olivier ToupetstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Aliakbar AghamohammadistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We propose a framework for resilient autonomous navigation in perceptually challenging unknown environments with mobility-stressing elements such as uneven surfaces with rocks and boulders, steep slopes, negative obstacles like cliffs and holes, and narrow passages. Environments are GPS-denied and perceptually-degraded with variable lighting from dark to lit and obscurants (dust, fog, smoke). Lack of prior maps and degraded communication eliminates the possibility of prior or off-board computation or operator intervention. This necessitates real-time on-board computation using noisy sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose a resilient architecture that exploits redundancy and heterogeneity in sensing modalities. Further resilience is achieved by triggering recovery behaviors upon failure. We propose a fast settling algorithm to generate robust multi-fidelity traversability estimates in real-time. The proposed approach was deployed on multiple physical systems including skid-steer and tracked robots, a high-speed RC car and legged robots, as a part of Team CoSTAR‚Äôs effort to the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where the team won 2 nd and 1 st place in the Tunnel and Urban Circuits, respectively.	
 Automatic Comic Generation with Stylistic Multi-page Layouts and Emotion-driven Text Balloon Generation	Xin Yang, Zongliang Ma, Letian Yu, Ying Cao, Baocai Yin, Xiaopeng Wei, Qiang Zhang, RynsonWHLau	xinyang@dlut.edu.cn	None	In this paper, we propose a fully automatic system for generating comic books from videos without any human intervention. Given an input video along with its subtitles, our approach first extracts informative keyframes by analyzing the subtitles, and stylizes keyframes into comic-style images. Then, we propose a novel automatic multi-page layout framework, which can allocate the images across multiple pages and synthesize visually interesting layouts based on the rich semantics of the images (e.g., importance and inter-image relation). Finally, as opposed to using the same type of balloon as in previous works, we propose an emotion-aware balloon generation method to create different types of word balloons by analyzing the emotion of subtitles and audios. Our method is able to vary balloon shapes and word sizes in balloons in response to different emotions, leading to more enriched reading experience. Once the balloons are generated, they are placed adjacent to their corresponding speakers via speaker detection. Our results show that our method, without requiring any user inputs, can generate high-quality comic pages with visually rich layouts and balloons. Our user studies also demonstrate that users prefer our generated results over those by state-of-the-art comic generation systems.	
 Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition Using Parallel Corpus: A New Approach Using XLM-RoBERTa Alignment	Bing LiMicrosoftYujie HeMicrosoftWenjin XuMicrosoft	None	None	We propose a novel approach for cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) zero-shot transfer using parallel corpora. We built an entity alignment model on top of XLM-RoBERTa to project the entities detected on the English part of the parallel data to the target language sentences, whose accuracy surpasses all previous unsupervised models. With the alignment model we can get pseudo-labeled NER data set in the target language to train task-specific model. Unlike using translation methods, this approach benefits from natural fluency and nuances in target-language original corpus. We also propose a modified loss function similar to focal loss but assigns weights in the opposite direction to further improve the model training on noisy pseudo-labeled data set. We evaluated this proposed approach over 4 target languages on benchmark data sets and got competitive F1 scores compared to most recent SOTA models. We also gave extra discussions about the impact of parallel corpus size and domain on the final transfer performance.	
 Steady State Modeling for Variable Frequency AC Power Flow This material is based upon work supported by the New York Power Authority (NYPA), the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE-1747503.	David Sehloff and Line Roald	None	None	Advantages of operating portions of a power system at frequencies different from the standard 50 or 60 Hz have been demonstrated in the low frequency AC (LFAC) and high voltage DC (HVDC) literature. Branches constrained by stability or thermal limits can benefit from increased capacity and flexibility. Since advances in power electronics enable the choice of an operating frequency, tools are needed to make this choice. In order to quantify the advantages as functions of frequency, this paper provides models for steady state calculations with frequency as a variable and validates the modeling assumptions. It then introduces an analytical quantification of the power flow capacity of a transmission branch as a function of frequency, demonstrating different active constraints across the range of frequency. The modeling and power flow calculations are demonstrated for a practical transmission line using manufacturer data. The models presented here provide a foundation for system level studies with variable frequency using optimal power flow.

Separation of the system into manageable parts is needed to support analysis at various levels of granularity so that the system is maintainable and adaptable over its life cycle. In this paper, we argue that operads provide an effective knowledge representation to address these challenges. Formal documentation of a syntactically correct design is built up during design synthesis, guided by semantic reasoning about design effectiveness. Throughout, the ability to decompose the system into parts and reconstitute the whole is maintained. We describe recent progress in effective modeling under this paradigm and directions for future work to systematically address scalability challenges for complex system design.

 Streaming Erasure Codes over Multi-Access Relayed Networks	Gustavo Kasper FacendadaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Elad DomanovitzdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ashish KhistidaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, WaiTian TanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand John ApostolopoulosstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, ON MS G, CanadastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTEnterprise Networking Innovation Labs, Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA , USA	None	None	Many emerging multimedia streaming applications involve multiple users communicating under strict latency constraints. In this paper we study streaming codes for a network involving two source nodes, one relay node and a destination node. In our setting, each source node transmits a stream of messages, through the relay, to a destination, who is required to decode the messages under a strict delay constraint. For the case of a single source node, a class of streaming codes has been proposed by Fong et al. [ 2 ] , using the concept of delay-spectrum . In the present work we present an in-depth analysis of the properties of delay-spectrum and apply them to develop streaming codes for our proposed setting through a novel framework. Our first scheme involves greedily selecting the rate on the link from relay to destination and using properties of the delay-spectrum to find feasible streaming codes that satisfy the required delay constraints. We provide a closed form expression for the achievable rate region and identify conditions when the proposed scheme is optimal by establishing a natural outer bound. Our second scheme builds upon this approach, but uses a numerical optimization-based approach to improve the achievable rate region over the first scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve significant improvements over baseline schemes based on single-user codes.	
 Can Offline Testing of Deep Neural Networks Replace Their Online Testing?This work has received funding from Luxembourg‚Äôs National Research Fund (FNR) under grant BRIDGES2020/IS/14711346/FUNTASY, the European Research Council under the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 694277), IEE S.A.

Donghwan Shin was partially supported by the Basic Science Research Programme through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2019R1A6A3A03033444).	Fitash Ul Haq, Donghwan Shin, Shiva Nejati, Lionel Briand	None	None	We distinguish two general modes of testing for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained without involving the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application environment and tested in a closed-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. Typically, DNNs are subjected to both types of testing during their development life cycle where offline testing is applied immediately after DNN training and online testing follows after offline testing and once a DNN is deployed within a specific application environment. In this paper, we study the relationship between offline and online testing. Our goal is to determine how offline testing and online testing differ or complement one another and if offline testing results can be used to help reduce the cost of online testing? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end controls of steering functions of self-driving vehicles. Our results show that offline testing is less effective than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing. Further, we cannot exploit offline testing results to reduce the cost of online testing in practice since we are not able to identify specific situations where offline testing could be as accurate as online testing in identifying safety requirement violations.

 Holomorphic representation of minimal surfaces in simply isotropic space	Luiz da Silva	None	None	It is known that minimal surfaces in Euclidean space can be represented in terms of holomorphic functions. For example, we have the well-known Weierstrass representation, where part of the holomorphic data is chosen to be the stereographic projection of the normal of the corresponding surface, and also the Bj√∂rling representation, where it is prescribed a curve on the surface and the unit normal on this curve. In this work, we are interested in the holomorphic representation of minimal surfaces in simply isotropic space, a three-dimensional space equipped with a rank 2 metric of index zero. Since the isotropic metric is degenerate, a surface normal cannot be unequivocally defined based on metric properties only, which leads to distinct definitions of an isotropic normal. As a consequence, this may also lead to distinct forms of a Weierstrass and of a Bj√∂rling representation. Here, we show how to represent simply isotropic minimal surfaces in accordance with the choice of an isotropic surface normal.	
 Named Entity Recognition in the Style of Object Detection	Bing LiMicrosoftlibimicrosoftcom	None	None	In this work, we propose a two-stage method for named entity recognition (NER), especially for nested NER. We borrowed the idea from the two-stage Object Detection in computer vision and the way how they construct the loss function. First, a region proposal network generates region candidates and then a second-stage model discriminates and classifies the entity and makes the final prediction. We also designed a special loss function for the second-stage training that predicts the entityness and entity type at the same time. The model is built on top of pretrained BERT encoders, and we tried both BERT base and BERT large models. For experiments, we first applied it to flat NER tasks such as CoNLL2003 and OntoNotes 5.0 and got comparable results with traditional NER models using sequence labeling methodology. We then tested the model on the nested named entity recognition task ACE2005 and Genia, and got F1 score of 85.6 % percent \% % and 76.8 % percent \% % respectively. In terms of the second-stage training, we found that adding extra randomly selected regions plays an important role in improving the precision. We also did error profiling to better evaluate the performance of the model in different circumstances for potential improvements in the future.	
 A Coding Theory Perspective on Multiplexed Molecular Profiling of Biological Tissues	Luca DAlessio, Litian Liu, Ken Duffy, Yonina EldarMuriel Mdard, Mehrtash Babadi	None	None	High-throughput and quantitative experimental technologies are experiencing rapid advances in the biological sciences. One important recent technique is multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH), which enables the identification and localization of large numbers of individual strands of RNA within single cells. Core to that technology is a coding problem: with each RNA sequence of interest being a codeword, how to design a codebook of probes, and how to decode the resulting noisy measurements? Published work has relied on assumptions of uniformly distributed codewords and binary symmetric channels for decoding and to a lesser degree for code construction. Here we establish that both of these assumptions are inappropriate in the context of mFISH experiments and substantial decoding performance gains can be obtained by using more appropriate, less classical, assumptions. We propose a more appropriate asymmetric channel model that can be readily parameterized from data and use it to develop a maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders. We show that false discovery rate for rare RNAs, which is the key experimental metric, is vastly improved with MAP decoders even when employed with the existing sub-optimal codebook. Using an evolutionary optimization methodology, we further show that by permuting the codebook to better align with the prior, which is an experimentally straightforward procedure, significant further improvements are possible.

 Strongly non-linear superconducting silicon resonators	Bonnet, Chiodi, Flanigan, Delagrange, Brochu, Dbarre, le Sueur	None	None	Superconducting boron-doped silicon is a promising material for integrated silicon quantum devices. In particular, its low electronic density and moderate disorder make it a suitable candidate for the fabrication of large inductances with low losses at microwave frequencies. We study experimentally the electrodynamics of superconducting silicon thin layers using coplanar waveguide resonators, focusing on the kinetic inductance, the internal losses, and the variation of these quantities with the resonator read-out power. We report the first observation in a doped semiconductor of microwave resonances with internal quality factors of a few thousand. As expected in the BCS framework, superconducting silicon presents a large sheet kinetic inductance in the 50-500 pH range, comparable to strongly disordered superconductors. The kinetic inductance temperature dependence is well described by Mattis-Bardeen theory. However, we find an unexpectedly strong non-linearity of the complex surface impedance that cannot be satisfyingly explained either by depairing or by quasiparticle heating.

The independent set is maximal if no node outside the independent set can join it. In network applications, maximal independent sets can be used as cluster heads in ad hoc and wireless sensor networks. In order to deal with any failure in networks, self-stabilizing algorithms have been proposed in the literature to calculate the maximal independent set under different hypothesis.In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing algorithm to compute a maximal independent set where nodes of the independent set are far from each other at least with distance 3. We prove the correctness and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation tests show the ability of our algorithm to find a reduced number of nodes in large scale networks which allows strong control of networks.

Currently, there is a drive to implement field programmable photonic circuits, a need which is only magnified by new neuromorphic and quantum computing applications. The most promising non-volatile photonic components employ phase change materials such as GST and GSST, which had their origin in electronic memory. However, in the optical domain, these compounds introduce significant losses potentially preventing a large number of applications. Here, we evaluate the use of two newly introduced low loss phase change materials, Sb 2 S 3 and Sb 2 Se 3 , on a silicon nitride photonic platform.

 Invariant Forms in Hybrid and Impact Systems and a Taming of Zeno		wac76@cornell.edu	None	Hybrid (and impact) systems are dynamical systems experiencing both continuous and discrete transitions. In this work, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for when a given differential form is invariant, with special attention paid to the case of the existence of invariant volumes. Particular attention is given to impact systems where the continuous dynamics are Lagrangian and subject to nonholonomic constraints. A celebrated result for volume-preserving dynamical systems is Poincar√© recurrence. In order to be recurrent, trajectories need to exist for long periods of time, which can be controlled in continuous-time systems through e.g. compactness. For hybrid systems, an additional mechanism can occur which breaks long-time existence: Zeno (infinitely many discrete transitions in a finite amount of time). We demonstrate that the existence of a smooth invariant volume severely inhibits Zeno behavior; hybrid systems with the ‚Äúboundary identity property‚Äù along with an invariant volume-form have almost no Zeno trajectories (although Zeno trajectories can still exist). This leads to the result that many billiards (e.g. the classical point, the rolling disk, and the rolling ball) are recurrent independent on the shape of the compact table-top.	
 Relating Black Hole Shadow to Quasinormal Modes for Rotating Black Holes	Huan Yang	None	None	In this work, we explore the connection between the critical curves (‚Äúshadows‚Äù) and the quasinormal mode frequencies (in the eikonal limit) of Kerr black holes. This mapping has been previously established for non-rotating black holes.

 Constraints on Planets in Nearby Young Moving Groups Detectable by High-Contrast Imaging and Gaia Astrometry	ALWallacehref httpsorcidorg ,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, MJIrelandhref httpsorcidorgX,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, CFederrathhref httpsorcidorg,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTResearch School of Astronomy Astrophysics, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT , Australia	None	None	The formation of giant planets can be studied through direct imaging by observing planets both during and after formation. Giant planets are expected to form either by core accretion, which is typically associated with low initial entropy (cold-start models) or by gravitational instability, associated with high initial entropy of the gas (hot-start models). Thus, constraining the initial entropy can provide insight into a planet‚Äôs formation process and determines the resultant brightness evolution. In this study, we find that, by observing planets in nearby moving groups of known age both through direct imaging and astrometry with Gaia, it will be possible to constrain the initial entropy of giant planets. We simulate a set of planetary systems in stars in nearby moving groups identified by BANYAN Œ£ Œ£ \Sigma roman_Œ£ and assume a model for planet distribution consistent with radial velocity detections.

 CLiMP: A Benchmark for Chinese Language Model Evaluation	University of Colorado Boulder,New York University	None	None	Linguistically informed analyses of language models (LMs) contribute to the understanding and improvement of these models. Here, we introduce the corpus of Chinese linguistic minimal pairs (CLiMP), which can be used to investigate what knowledge Chinese LMs acquire. CLiMP consists of sets of 1,000 minimal pairs (MPs) for 16 syntactic contrasts in Mandarin, covering 9 major Mandarin linguistic phenomena. The MPs are semi-automatically generated, and human agreement with the labels in CLiMP is 95.8 % percent 95.8 95.8\% 95.8 % . We evaluate 11 different LMs on CLiMP, covering n -grams, LSTMs, and Chinese BERT. We find that classifier‚Äìnoun agreement and verb complement selection are the phenomena that models generally perform best at. However, models struggle the most with the b«é construction, binding, and filler-gap dependencies. Overall, Chinese BERT achieves an 81.8 % percent 81.8 81.8\% 81.8 % average accuracy, while the performances of LSTMs and 5-grams are only moderately above chance level.

 Route Choice-based Socio-Technical Macroscopic Traffic Model	Tanushree RoyDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringThe Pennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA , USASatadru DeyDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringThe Pennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA , USA	None	None	Human route choice is undeniably one of the key contributing factors towards traffic dynamics. However, most existing macroscopic traffic models are typically concerned with driving behavior and do not incorporate human route choice behavior models in their formulation. In this paper, we propose a socio-technical macroscopic traffic model that characterizes the traffic states using human route choice attributes. Essentially, such model provides a framework for capturing the Cyber-Physical-Social coupling in smart transportation systems. To derive this model, we first use Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) to model the human passengers‚Äô route choice under bounded rationality. These choices are assumed to be influenced by traffic alerts and other incomplete traffic information. Next, we assume that the vehicles are operating under a non-cooperative cruise control scenario. Accordingly, human route choice segregates the traffic into multiple classes where each class corresponds to a specific route between an origin-destination pair. Thereafter, we derive a Mean Field Game (MFG) limit of this non-cooperative game to obtain a macroscopic model which embeds the human route choice attribute. Finally, we analyze the mathematical characteristics of the proposed model and present simulation studies to illustrate the model behavior.	
 Open-domain Topic Identification of Out-of-domain Utterances using Wikipedia	Alexandry AugustinUniversity of SouthamptonSouthampton, UKAlexandros PapangelisAmazon Alexa AISunnyvale, USAMargarita KottiToshiba Research EuropeCambridge, UKPavlos VougiouklisHuawei TechnologiesEdinburgh, UKJonathon HareUniversity of SouthamptonSouthampton, UKNorbert BraunschweilerToshiba Europe LimitedCambridge, UK	None	None	Users of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) expect high quality interactions across a wide range of diverse topics. However, the implementation of SDS capable of responding to every conceivable user utterance in an informative way is a challenging problem. Multi-domain SDS must necessarily identify and deal with out-of-domain (OOD) utterances to generate appropriate responses as users do not always know in advance what domains the SDS can handle. To address this problem, we extend the current state-of-the-art in multi-domain SDS by estimating the topic of OOD utterances using external knowledge representation from Wikipedia. Experimental results on real human-to-human dialogues showed that our approach does not degrade domain prediction performance when compared to the base model. But more significantly, our joint training achieves more accurate predictions of the nearest Wikipedia article by up to about 30% when compared to the benchmarks.	
 Boosting segmentation performance across datasets using histogram specification with application to pelvic bone segmentation			None	Accurate segmentation of the pelvic CTs is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of pelvic bone diseases and for planning patient-specific hip surgeries. With the emergence and advancements of deep learning for digital healthcare, several methodologies have been proposed for such segmentation tasks. But in a low data scenario, the lack of abundant data needed to train a Deep Neural Network is a significant bottle-neck. In this work, we propose a methodology based on modulation of image tonal distributions and deep learning to boost the performance of networks trained on limited data. The strategy involves pre-processing of test data through histogram specification. This simple yet effective approach can be viewed as a style transfer methodology. The segmentation task uses a U-Net configuration with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, optimized using an augmented BCE-IoU loss function. This configuration is validated on a total of 284 images taken from two publicly available CT datasets, TCIA (a cancer imaging archive) and the Visible Human Project. The average performance measures for the Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union are 95.7% and 91.9%, respectively, give strong evidence for the effectiveness of the approach, which is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methodologies.	
 Real-time oblivious erasure correction with linear time decoding and constant feedback	Shashwat Silas	None	None	We continue the study of rateless codes for transmission of information across channels whose rate of erasure is unknown. In such a code, an infinite stream of encoding symbols can be generated from the message and sent across the erasure channel, and the decoder can decode the message after it has successfully collected a certain number of encoding symbols. A rateless erasure code is real-time oblivious if rather than collecting encoding symbols as they are received, the receiver either immediately decodes or discards each symbol it receives.

 Determining the optimal piecewise constant approximation for the Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process rate of Emergency Department patient arrivals	AlbertoDeSantishttpsorcidorg, TommasoGiovannellihttpsorcidorg, StefanoLucidihttpsorcidorg, MauroMessedaglia, MassimoRomahttpsorcidorg	None	None	Modeling the arrival process to an Emergency Department (ED) is the first step of all studies dealing with the patient flow within the ED. Many of them focus on the increasing phenomenon of ED overcrowding, which is afflicting hospitals all over the world. Since Discrete Event Simulation models are often adopted with the aim to assess solutions for reducing the impact of this problem, proper nonstationary processes are taken into account to reproduce time-dependent arrivals. Accordingly, an accurate estimation of the unknown arrival rate is required to guarantee reliability of results. In this work, an integer nonlinear black-box optimization problem is solved to determine the best piecewise constant approximation of the time-varying arrival rate function, by finding the optimal partition of the 24 hours into a suitable number of non equally spaced intervals. The black-box constraints of the optimization problem make the feasible solutions satisfy proper statistical hypotheses; these ensure the validity of the nonhomogeneous Poisson assumption about the arrival process, commonly adopted in the literature, and prevent to mix overdispersed data for model estimation. The cost function includes a fit error term for the solution accuracy and a penalty term to select an adeguate degree of regularity of the optimal solution. To show the effectiveness of this methodology, real data from one of the largest Italian hospital EDs are used.	
 A Strengthened Cutset Upper Bound on the Capacity of the Relay Channel and Applications	Abbas El Gamal, Amin Gohari and Chandra Nair	None	None	We develop a new upper bound on the capacity of the relay channel that is tighter than previously known upper bounds. This upper bound is proved using traditional weak converse techniques involving mutual information inequalities and Gallager-type explicit identification of auxiliary random variables. We show that the new upper bound is strictly tighter than all previous bounds for the Gaussian relay channel with non-zero channel gains. When specialized to the relay channel with orthogonal receiver components, the bound resolves a conjecture by Kim on a class of deterministic relay channels. When further specialized to the class of product-form relay channels with orthogonal receiver components, the bound resolves a generalized version of Cover‚Äôs relay channel problem, recovers the recent upper bound for the Gaussian case by Wu et al., and improves upon the recent bounds for the binary symmetric case by Wu et al. and Barnes et al., which were obtained using non-traditional geometric proof techniques. For the special class of a relay channel with orthogonal receiver components, we develop another upper bound on the capacity which utilizes an auxiliary receiver and show that it is strictly tighter than the bound by Tandon and Ulukus. Finally, we show through the Gaussian relay channel with i.i.d. relay output sequence that the bound with the auxiliary receiver can be strictly tighter than our main bound. 1 1 1 This paper was presented in part at the IEEE Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) 2021.	
 Newton‚Äôs Method for M-Tensor EquationsSupported by the NSF of China grant No.11771157, 11801184, the NSF of Guangdong Province grant No.2020B1515310013 and the Education Department of Hunan Province grant No.20C0559.	DongHui Li JieFeng Xu and HongBo GuanSchool of Mathematical Sciences,South China Normal University, Guangzhou, , ChinaEmail lidonghuimscnueducn	None	None	We are concerned with the tensor equations whose coefficient tensor is an M-tensor. We first propose a Newton method for solving the equation with a positive constant term and establish its global and quadratic convergence. Then we extend the method to solve the equation with a nonnegative constant term and establish its convergence. At last, we do numerical experiments to test the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed method is quite efficient.	
 Inverse optimal control for angle stabilization in converter-based generation	Taouba Jouini, Anders Rantzer and Emma Tegling	None	None	In inverse optimal control, the optimality of a given feedback stabilizing controller is a byproduct of the choice of a meaningful, a posteriori defined, cost functional. This allows for a simple tuning comparable to linear quadratic control, also for nonlinear controllers. Our work illustrates the usefulness of this approach in the control of converter-based power systems and networked systems in general, and thereby in finding controllers with topological structure and known optimality properties. In particular, we design an inverse optimal feedback controller that stabilizes the phase angles of voltage-source controlled DC/AC converters at an induced steady state with zero frequency error. The distributed angular droop controller yields active power to angle droop behavior at steady state. Moreover, we suggest a practical implementation of the controller and corroborate our results through simulations on a three-converter system and a numerical comparison with standard frequency droop control.

 Human Inference in Changing Environments With Temporal Structure	Arthur PratCarrabin, Robert Wilson, Jonathan Cohen, Rava Azeredo da Silveira	None	None	To make informed decisions in natural environments that change over time, humans must update their beliefs as new observations are gathered. Studies exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are history-independent. Yet temporal structure is everywhere in nature, and yields history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with ‚Äòoutput noise‚Äô that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates, human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning in humans.	
 Accuracy and Privacy Evaluations of Collaborative Data Analysis	Akira Imakura, Anna Bogdanova, Takaya Yamazoe, Kazumasa Omote, Tetsuya Sakurai	None	None	Distributed data analysis without revealing the individual data has recently attracted significant attention in several applications. A collaborative data analysis through sharing dimensionality reduced representations of data has been proposed as a non-model sharing-type federated learning. This paper analyzes the accuracy and privacy evaluations of this novel framework. In the accuracy analysis, we provided sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the collaborative data analysis and the centralized analysis with dimensionality reduction. In the privacy analysis, we proved that collaborative users‚Äô private datasets are protected with a double privacy layer against insider and external attacking scenarios.	
 Local saddles of relaxed averaged alternating reflections algorithms on phase retrieval	Pengwen Chen	pengwen@nchu.edu.tw	Applied mathematics, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan	Phase retrieval can be expressed as a non-convex constrained optimization problem to identify one phase minimizer one a torus. Many iterative transform techniques have been proposed to identify the minimizer, e.g., relaxed averaged alternating reflections(RAAR) algorithms. In this paper, we present one optimization viewpoint on the RAAR algorithm. RAAR algorithm is one alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM) with one penalty parameter. Pairing with multipliers (dual vectors), phase vectors on the primal space are lifted to higher dimensional vectors, RAAR algorithm is one continuation algorithm, which searches for local saddles in the primal-dual space. The dual iteration approximates one gradient ascent flow, which drives the corresponding local minimizers in a positive-definite Hessian region. Altering penalty parameters, the RAAR avoids the stagnation of these corresponding local minimizers in the primal space and thus screens out many stationary points corresponding to non-local minimizers.	
 Inexact gradient projection method with relative error tolerance	Aguiar, Ferreira, Prudente	None	None	A gradient projection method with feasible inexact projections is proposed in the present paper. The inexact projection is performed using a relative error tolerance. Asymptotic convergence analysis and iteration-complexity bounds of the method employing constant and Armijo step sizes are presented. Numerical results are reported illustrating the potential advantages of considering inexact projections instead of exact ones in some medium scale instances of a least squares problem over the spectrohedron.

 In-IDE Code Generation from Natural Language: Promise and Challenges	Frank Xu, Bogdan Vasilescu, Graham Neubig	fangzhex@cs.cmu.edu	None	A great part of software development involves conceptualizing or communicating the underlying procedures and logic that needs to be expressed in programs. One major difficulty of programming is turning concept into code , especially when dealing with the APIs of unfamiliar libraries. Recently, there has been a proliferation of machine learning methods for code generation and retrieval from natural language queries , but these have primarily been evaluated purely based on retrieval accuracy or overlap of generated code with developer-written code, and the actual effect of these methods on the developer workflow is surprisingly unattested. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive investigation of the promise and challenges of using such technology inside the PyCharm IDE, asking ‚Äúat the current state of technology does it improve developer productivity or accuracy, how does it affect the developer experience, and what are the remaining gaps and challenges?‚Äù To facilitate the study, we first develop a plugin for the PyCharm IDE that implements a hybrid of code generation and code retrieval functionality, and orchestrate virtual environments to enable collection of many user events (e.g. web browsing, keystrokes, fine-grained code edits). We ask developers with various backgrounds to complete 7 varieties of 14 Python programming tasks ranging from basic file manipulation to machine learning or data visualization, with or without the help of the plugin. While qualitative surveys of developer experience are largely positive, quantitative results with regards to increased productivity, code quality, or program correctness are inconclusive. Further analysis identifies several pain points that could improve the effectiveness of future machine learning based code generation/retrieval developer assistants, and demonstrates when developers prefer code generation over code retrieval and vice versa. We release all data and software to pave the road for future empirical studies on this topic, as well as development of better code generation models.	
 Global rigidity for ultra-differentiable quasiperiodic cocycles and its spectral applications	Hongyu Cheng, Lingrui Ge, Jiangong You, Qi Zhou	hychengmath@126.com	Chern Institute of Mathematics and LPMC, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China	For quasiperiodic Schr√∂dinger operators with one-frequency analytic potentials, from dynamical systems side, it has been proved that the corresponding quasiperiodic Schr√∂dinger cocycle is either rotations reducible or has positive Lyapunov exponent for all irrational frequency and almost every energy [ 2 ] . From spectral theory side, the ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger conjecture‚Äù [ 2 ] and the ‚ÄúLast‚Äôs intersection spectrum conjecture‚Äù have been verified [ 35 ] . The proofs of above results crucially depend on the analyticity of the potentials. People are curious about if the analyticity is essential for those problems, see open problems by Fayad-Krikorian [ 26 , 39 ] and Jitomirskaya-Marx [ 35 , 46 ] . In this paper, we prove the above mentioned results for ultra-differentiable potentials.

 Constraining gravitational wave amplitude birefringence and Chern-Simons gravity with GWTC-2	Maria Okounkova, Will Farr, Maximiliano Isi, Leo Stein	mokounkova@flatironinstitute.org	None	We perform a new test of general relativity (GR) with signals from GWTC-2, the LIGO and Virgo catalog of gravitational wave detections. We search for the presence of amplitude birefringence, in which left versus right circularly polarized modes of gravitational waves are exponentially enhanced and suppressed during propagation. Such an effect is present in various beyond-GR theories but is absent in GR. We constrain the amount of amplitude birefringence consistent with the data through an opacity parameter Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ , which we bound to be Œ∫ ‚â≤ 0.74 Gpc ‚àí 1 less-than-or-similar-to ùúÖ 0.74 superscript Gpc 1 \kappa\lesssim 0.74\textrm{ Gpc}^{-1} italic_Œ∫ ‚â≤ 0.74 Gpc start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Our constraint is derived under an assumption that all GWTC-2 events have a common distance. This result for Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ is statistically significant, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 7 √ó 10 ‚àí 2 7 superscript 10 2 7\times 10^{-2} 7 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT bits compared to an uninformative distribution on Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ . We then use these theory-agnostic results to constrain Chern-Simons gravity, a beyond-GR theory with motivations in quantum gravity. We bound the canonical Chern-Simons lengthscale to be ‚Ñì 0 ‚â≤ 1.0 √ó 10 3 less-than-or-similar-to subscript ‚Ñì 0 1.0 superscript 10 3 \ell_{0}\lesssim 1.0\times 10^{3} roman_‚Ñì start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≤ 1.0 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT km, in agreement with other long-distance measurement results.	
 On ‚Ñ§‚ÇÇ-Thurston norms and pseudo-horizontal surfaces in orientable Seifert 3-manifolds	Xiaoming Du	scxmdu@scut.edu.cn	"School of Mathematics, South China University of Technology,

 Exploring multi-task multi-lingual learning of transformer models for hate speech and offensive speech identification in social media	Sudhanshu Mishra, Shivangi Prasad, Shubhanshu MishrastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Hate Speech has become a major content moderation issue for online social media platforms. Given the volume and velocity of online content production, it is impossible to manually moderate hate speech related content on any platform. In this paper we utilize a multi-task and multi-lingual approach based on recently proposed Transformer Neural Networks to solve three sub-tasks for hate speech. These sub-tasks were part of the 2019 shared task on hate speech and offensive content (HASOC) identification in Indo-European languages. We expand on our submission to that competition by utilizing multi-task models which are trained using three approaches, a) multi-task learning with separate task heads, b) back-translation, and c) multi-lingual training. Finally, we investigate the performance of various models and identify instances where the Transformer based models perform differently and better. We show that it is possible to to utilize different combined approaches to obtain models that can generalize easily on different languages and tasks, while trading off slight accuracy (in some cases) for a much reduced inference time compute cost. We open source an updated version of our HASOC 2019 code with the new improvements at https://github.com/socialmediaie/MTML_HateSpeech .	
 Fundamental limits and algorithms for sparse linear regression with sublinear sparsity	Lan TruongltcamacukDepartment of EngineeringUniversity of CambridgeCambridge, CB PZ, UK	None	None	We establish exact asymptotic expressions for the normalized mutual information and minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) of sparse linear regression in the sub-linear sparsity regime. Our result is achieved by a generalization of the adaptive interpolation method in Bayesian inference for linear regimes to sub-linear ones. A modification of the well-known approximate message passing algorithm to approach the MMSE fundamental limit is also proposed, and its state evolution is rigorously analysed. Our results show that the traditional linear assumption between the signal dimension and number of observations in the replica and adaptive interpolation methods is not necessary for sparse signals. They also show how to modify the existing well-known AMP algorithms for linear regimes to sub-linear ones.	
 Wolstenholme and Vandiver primes	Andrew Booker, Shehzad Hathi, Michael Mossinghoff, Timothy Trudgian	andrew.booker@bristol.ac.uk	School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK	A prime p ùëù p italic_p is a Wolstenholme prime if ( 2 p p ) ‚â° 2 binomial 2 ùëù ùëù 2 \binom{2p}{p}\equiv 2 ( FRACOP start_ARG 2 italic_p end_ARG start_ARG italic_p end_ARG ) ‚â° 2 mod p 4 superscript ùëù 4 p^{4} italic_p start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , or, equivalently, if p ùëù p italic_p divides the numerator of the Bernoulli number B p ‚àí 3 subscript ùêµ ùëù 3 B_{p-3} italic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p - 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; a Vandiver prime p ùëù p italic_p is one that divides the Euler number E p ‚àí 3 subscript ùê∏ ùëù 3 E_{p-3} italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p - 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . Only two Wolstenholme primes and eight Vandiver primes are known.

To facilitate this, we develop a number of new congruences for Bernoulli and Euler numbers mod p ùëù p italic_p that are favorable for computation, and we implement some highly parallel searches using GPUs.	
 Maximizing performance of quantum cascade laser-pumped molecular lasers	Fan Wang, Steven Johnson, Henry Everitt	None	None	Quantum cascade laser (QCL) -pumped molecular lasers (QPMLs) have recently been introduced as a new source of powerful ( > > > 1 mW), tunable ( > > > 1 THz), narrow-band ( < < < 10 kHz), continuous-wave terahertz radiation. The performance of these lasers depends critically on molecular collision physics, pump saturation, and on the design of the laser cavity. Using a validated three-level model that captures the essential collision and saturation behaviors of the QPML gas nitrous oxide (N 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O), we explore how threshold pump power and output terahertz power depend on pump power, gas pressure, as well as on the diameter, length, and output-coupler transmissivity of a cylindrical cavity. The analysis indicates that maximum power occurs as pump saturation is minimized in a manner that depends much more sensitively on pressure than on cell diameter, length, or transmissivity. A near-optimal compact laser cavity can produce more than 10 mW of power tunable over frequencies above 1 THz when pumped by a multi-watt QCL.	
 An Early Stopping Bayesian Data Assimilation Approach for Mixed-Logit Estimation	Shanshan Xie, Tim Hillel, Ying Jin	sx239@cam.ac.uk	Department of Architecture, 1-5 Scroope Terrace, Cambridge, CB2 1PX, the United Kingdom	The mixed-logit model is a flexible tool in transportation choice analysis, which provides valuable insights into inter and intra-individual behavioural heterogeneity. However, applications of mixed-logit models in practice are limited by the high computational and data requirements for model estimation. When estimating mixed-logit models on small samples, the Bayesian estimation approach becomes vulnerable to over and under-fitting. This is problematic for investigating the behaviour of specific population sub-groups or market segments, where a modeller may wish to estimate separate models for multiple similar contexts, each with low data availability. Similar challenges arise when adapting an existing model to a new location or time period, e.g., when estimating post-pandemic travel behaviour.	
 QCD effects in lepton angular distributions of Drell-Yan/ùëç production and jet discrimination	, Randall Evan McClellan, JenChieh Peng, Oleg Teryaev	None	None	We present a comparison of data of lepton angular distributions of Drell-Yan/ Z ùëç Z italic_Z production with the fixed-order pQCD calculations by which the baseline of pQCD effects is illustrated. As for the Z ùëç Z italic_Z production, we predict that A 0 subscript ùê¥ 0 A_{0} italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and A 2 subscript ùê¥ 2 A_{2} italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for Z ùëç Z italic_Z plus single gluon-jet events are very different from that of Z ùëç Z italic_Z plus single quark-jet events, allowing a new experimental tool for checking various algorithms which attempt to discriminate quark jets from gluon jets. Using an intuitive geometric approach, we show that the violation of the Lam-Tung relation, appearing at large transverse-momentum region, is attributed to the presence of a non-coplanarity effect. This interpretation is consistent with the appearance of violation beyond LO-QCD effect.

 Inadequacy of Linear Methods for Minimal Sensor Placement and Feature Selection in Nonlinear Systems; a New Approach Using Secants	Samuel Otto, Clarence Rowley	sotto@princeton.edu	"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton
University, Princeton, NJ 08544"	Sensor placement and feature selection are critical steps in engineering, modeling, and data science that share a common mathematical theme: the selected measurements should enable solution of an inverse problem. Most real-world systems of interest are nonlinear, yet the majority of available techniques for feature selection and sensor placement rely on assumptions of linearity or simple statistical models. We show that when these assumptions are violated, standard techniques can lead to costly over-sensing without guaranteeing that the desired information can be recovered from the measurements. In order to remedy these problems, we introduce a novel data-driven approach for sensor placement and feature selection for a general type of nonlinear inverse problem based on the information contained in secant vectors between data points. Using the secant-based approach, we develop three efficient greedy algorithms that each provide different types of robust, near-minimal reconstruction guarantees. We demonstrate them on two problems where linear techniques consistently fail: sensor placement to reconstruct a fluid flow formed by a complicated shock-mixing layer interaction and selecting fundamental manifold learning coordinates on a torus.	
 Consistent approximation of fractional order operators	Yiheng Wei, YangQuan Chen, Yingdong Wei, Xuefeng Zhang	None	None	Fractional order controllers become increasingly popular due to their versatility and superiority in various performance. However, the bottleneck in deploying these tools in practice is related to their analog or numerical implementation. Numerical approximations are usually employed in which the approximation of fractional differintegrator is the foundation. Generally, the following three identical equations always hold, i.e., 1 s Œ± 1 s 1 ‚àí Œ± = 1 s 1 superscript ùë† ùõº 1 superscript ùë† 1 ùõº 1 ùë† \frac{1}{s^{\alpha}}\frac{1}{s^{1-\alpha}}=\frac{1}{s} divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 - italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG = divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_s end_ARG , s Œ± 1 s Œ± = 1 superscript ùë† ùõº 1 superscript ùë† ùõº 1 s^{\alpha}\frac{1}{s^{\alpha}}=1 italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG = 1 and s Œ± s 1 ‚àí Œ± = s superscript ùë† ùõº superscript ùë† 1 ùõº ùë† s^{\alpha}s^{1-\alpha}=s italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 - italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = italic_s . However, for the approximate models of fractional differintegrator s Œ± superscript ùë† ùõº s^{\alpha} italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , Œ± ‚àà ( ‚àí 1 , 0 ) ‚à™ ( 0 , 1 ) ùõº 1 0 0 1 \alpha\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1) italic_Œ± ‚àà ( - 1 , 0 ) ‚à™ ( 0 , 1 ) , there usually exist some conflicts on the mentioned equations, which might enlarge the approximation error or even cause fallacies in multiple orders occasion. To overcome the conflicts, this brief develops a piecewise approximate model and provides two procedures for designing the model parameters. The comparison with several existing methods shows that the proposed methods do not only satisfy the equalities but also achieve high approximation accuracy. From this, it is believed that this work can serve for simulation and realization of fractional order controllers more friendly.

We then present the design and results of experimentation on combinations of rotations and perspectives used during training and the resulting impact on test accuracy. We then show when and how well data augmentation techniques are capable of simulating rotations vs. perspectives not present in the training data. We perform all experiments using CNNs with and without homogeneous vector capsules (HVCs) and investigate and show the capsules‚Äô ability to better encode the equivariance of the sub-components of the micro-PCBs. The results of our experiments lead us to conclude that training a neural network equipped with HVCs, capable of modeling equivariance among sub-components, coupled with training on a diversity of perspectives, achieves the greatest classification accuracy on micro-PCB data.

 Using edge cuts to find Euler tours and Euler families in hypergraphs	Mateja ajnaand Andrew Wagner	None	None	An Euler tour in a hypergraph is a closed walk that traverses each edge of the hypergraph exactly once, while an Euler family is a family of closed walks that jointly traverse each edge exactly once and cannot be concatenated. In this paper, we show how the problem of existence of an Euler tour (family) in a hypergraph H ùêª H italic_H can be reduced to the analogous problem in some smaller hypergraphs that are derived from H ùêª H italic_H using an edge cut of H ùêª H italic_H . In the process, new techniques of edge cut assignments and collapsed hypergraphs are introduced. Moreover, we describe algorithms based on these characterizations that determine whether or not a hypergraph admits an Euler tour (family), and can also construct an Euler tour (family) if it exists.	
 A proposal to improve Ni-based superconductors	ZiJian Lang gbsn, Ruoshi Jiang gbsn, Wei Ku bsmi	None	None	Recently discovered superconductivity in hole-doped nickelate Nd 0.8 0.8 {}_{0.8} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 0.8 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Sr 0.2 0.2 {}_{0.2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 0.2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT NiO 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT caught intensive attention in the field. An immediate question is how to improve its superconducting properties. Guided by the key characteristics of electronic structures of the cuprates and the nickelates, we propose that nickel chalcogenides with a similar lattice structure should be a promising family of materials. Using NdNiS 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT as an example, we find this particular crystal structure a stable one, through first-principle structural optimization and phonon calculation. We justify our proposal by comparing with CaCuO 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and NdNiO 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT the strength of the charge-transfer characteristics and the trend in their low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonians of doped hole carriers. These analysis indicates that nickel chalcogenides host low-energy physics closer to that of the cuprates, with stronger magnetic interaction than the nickelates, and thus deserve further experimental exploration. Our proposal also opens up the possibility of a wide range of parameter tuning through ligand substitution among chalcogenides, to further improve superconducting properties.

 The effect of circumstellar matter on the double-peaked type Ic supernovae and implications for LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc	Harim Jin, SungChul Yoon, Sergei Blinnikov	None	None	Double peaked light curves are observed for some Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic) including LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc. One possible explanation of the first peak would be shock-cooling emission from massive extended material around the progenitor, which is produced by mass eruption or rapid expansion of the outermost layers of the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. We investigate the effects of such circumstellar matter (CSM) on the multi-band optical light curves of SNe Ic using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. Two different SNe Ic progenitor masses at the pre-SN stage (3.93 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 8.26 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) are considered in the SN models.

We also investigate the effects of the radioactive nickel distribution on the overall shape of the light curve and the color evolution. Comparison of our SN models with the double peaked SNe Ic LSQ14efd, iPTF15dtg and SN 2020bvc indicate that these three SNe Ic had a similar CSM structure (i.e., M CSM ‚âà 0.1 ‚àí 0.2 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ CSM 0.1 0.2 subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\mathrm{CSM}}\approx 0.1-0.2M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CSM end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚âà 0.1 - 0.2 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and R CSM = 10 13 ‚àí 10 14 cm subscript ùëÖ CSM superscript 10 13 superscript 10 14 cm R_{\mathrm{CSM}}=10^{13}-10^{14}~{}\mathrm{cm} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CSM end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_cm ), which might imply a common mechanism for the CSM formation.

Based on the widely-used W-stacking method, we propose a new wide-field imaging algorithm that can synthesize visibility data from a model of the sky brightness via degridding, able to construct dirty maps from measured visibility data via gridding. Results carry the smallest approximation error yet achieved relative to the exact calculation involving the direct Fourier transform. In contrast to the original W-stacking method, the new algorithm performs least-misfit optimal gridding (and degridding) in all three directions, and is capable of achieving much higher accuracy than is feasible with the original algorithm. In particular, accuracy at the level of single precision arithmetic is readily achieved by choosing a least-misfit convolution function of width W = 7 ùëä 7 W=7 italic_W = 7 and an image cropping parameter of x 0 = 0.25 subscript ùë• 0 0.25 x_{0}=0.25 italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.25 . If the accuracy required is only that attained by the original W-stacking method, the computational cost for both the gridding and FFT steps can be substantially reduced using the proposed method by making an appropriate choice of the width and image cropping parameters.	
 1 INTRODUCTION			None	We present a novel cosmological scenario that describes both inflation and dark matter. A concrete realization of our scenario is given based on a well-established particle physics model, where an axionlike field drives inflation until a potential barrier, which keeps a waterfall field at the origin, disappears to trigger a waterfall transition. Such a barrier makes the inflaton potential much flatter, improving significantly the naturalness and viability of the otherwise problematic setup adopted previously. The observed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background indicates that the inflationary Hubble scale, which is allowed to span a wide range, uniquely fixes the inflaton mass and decay constant. This raises an intriguing possibility of probing inflation via experimental searches for axionlike particles. Further, our model involves dark matter candidates including the inflaton itself. Also, for a complex waterfall field, we can determine cosmologically the Peccei-Quinn scale associated with the strong CP problem.	
 Graph Neural Network for Traffic Forecasting: A Survey	Weiwei Jiang, Jiayun Luo	None	Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China	Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. Deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. In recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source codes for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source codes will be updated.	
 Decomposable Specht modules indexed by bihooks II	Liron SpeyerOkinawa Institute of Science and Technology Tancha, Onnason, KunigamigunOkinawa, Japan, Robert MuthWashington Jefferson CollegeWashington, PA, USA Liron SpeyerOkinawa Institute of Science and TechnologyOkinawa, Japan Louise SuttonOkinawa Institute of Science and TechnologyOkinawa, Japan	None	None	Previously, the last two authors found large families of decomposable Specht modules labelled by bihooks, over the Iwahori‚ÄìHecke algebra of type B ùêµ B italic_B . In most cases we conjectured that these were the only decomposable Specht modules labelled by bihooks, proving it in some instances. Inspired by a recent semisimplicity result of Bowman, Bessenrodt and the third author, we look back at our decomposable Specht modules and show that they are often either semisimple, or very close to being so. We obtain their exact structure and composition factors in these cases. In the process, we determine the graded decomposition numbers for almost all of the decomposable Specht modules indexed by bihooks.	
 Observation of photon recoil effects in single-beam absorption spectroscopy with an ultracold strontium gas	Fachao Hu, Canzhu Tan, Yuhai Jiang, Matthias Weidemller, Bing Zhu	None	None	We report on observing photon recoil effects in the absorption of a single monochromatic light at 689 nm through an ultracold 88 88 {}^{88} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 88 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Sr gas, where the recoil frequency is comparable to natural linewidth of the narrow-line transition 5 s 2 1 S 0 ‚àí 5 s 5 p 3 P 1 5 superscript superscript s 2 1 subscript S 0 5 s 5 superscript p 3 subscript P 1 5\mathrm{s^{2}}\,^{1}\textrm{S}_{0}-5\mathrm{s}5\mathrm{p}\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{1} 5 roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 5 roman_s 5 roman_p start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in strontium. In the regime of high-saturation, the absorption profile becomes asymmetric due to the photon-recoil shift, which is of the same order as the natural linewidth. The lineshape is described by an extension of the optical Bloch equations including the momentum transfers to atoms during emission and absorption of photons. Our work reveals the photon recoil effects in a simplest single-beam absorption setting, which is of significant relevance to other applications such as saturation spectroscopy, Ramsey interferometry, and absorption imaging.	
 LSOIE: A Large-Scale Dataset for Supervised Open Information Extraction	Jacob SolawetzRoboflow, IncMinneapolis, MN, USAStefan LarsonRosegold AIAnn Arbor, MI, USA	None	None	Open Information Extraction (OIE) systems seek to compress the factual propositions of a sentence into a series of n -ary tuples. These tuples are useful for downstream tasks in natural language processing like knowledge base creation, textual entailment, and natural language understanding. However, current OIE datasets are limited in both size and diversity. We introduce a new dataset by converting the qa-srl 2.0 dataset to a large-scale OIE dataset ( lsoie ). Our lsoie dataset is 20 times larger than the next largest human-annotated OIE dataset. We construct and evaluate several benchmark OIE models on lsoie , providing baselines for future improvements on the task. Our lsoie data, models, and code are made publicly available. 1 1 1 Our lsoie dataset, models, and code can be found at https://github.com/Jacobsolawetz/large-scale-oie .	
 Neural Sentence Ordering Based on Constraint Graphs	Yutao ZhuspadesuitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Kun ZhouheartsuitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,JianYun NiespadesuitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Shengchao LiuspadesuitclubsuitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Zhicheng DoudiamondsuitstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Sentence ordering aims at arranging a list of sentences in the correct order. Based on the observation that sentence order at different distances may rely on different types of information, we devise a new approach based on multi-granular orders between sentences. These orders form multiple constraint graphs, which are then encoded by Graph Isomorphism Networks and fused into sentence representations. Finally, sentence order is determined using the order-enhanced sentence representations. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms all the existing baselines significantly, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate the advantage of considering multiple types of order information and using graph neural networks to integrate sentence content and order information for the task.

 Solar Radiation Ramping Events Modeling Using Spatio-temporal Point Processes	Minghe Zhanglabele, markmzhanggatechedu, Chen Xulabele, markcxugatechedu, Andy Sunlabele, marksunxmitedu, Feng Qiulabele, markfqiuanlgov, Yao Xielabele, markyaoxiegatechedu	None	"H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE),
Georgia Institute of Technology,"	Modeling and predicting solar events, particularly the solar ramping event, is critical for improving situational awareness for solar power generation systems. It has been acknowledged that weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and cloud density can significantly impact the emergence and position of solar ramping events. As a result, modeling these events with complex spatio-temporal correlations is highly challenging. To tackle the question, we adopt a novel spatio-temporal categorical point process model, which intuitively and effectively addresses correlation and interaction among ramping events. We demonstrate the interpretability and predictive power of our model on extensive real-data experiments.	
 Pseudo Polynomial Size LP Formulation for Calculating the Least Core Value of Weighted Voting Games A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the 12th Annual Meeting of the Asian Association for Algorithms and Computation, April 19 - 21, 2019, Seoul, South Korea. This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP26285045, JP26242027, JP20K04973. We thank Kento Tanaka for extensive discussions.		None	None	In this paper, we propose a pseudo polynomial size LP formulation for finding a payoff vector in the least core of a weighted voting game. The numbers of variables and constraints in our formulation are both bounded by O ( n W + ) O ùëõ subscript ùëä \mbox{O}(nW_{+}) O ( italic_n italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT + end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , where n ùëõ n italic_n is the number of players and W + subscript ùëä W_{+} italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT + end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the total sum of (integer) voting weights. When we employ our formulation, a commercial LP solver calculates a payoff vector in the least core of practical weighted voting games in a few seconds. We also extend our approach to vector weighted voting games.	
 A Generative Model of Galactic Dust Emission Using Variational Inference	Ben Thorne,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTLloyd Knox,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Karthik PrabhustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Physics, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA , USA	None	None	Emission from the interstellar medium can be a significant contaminant of measurements of the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). For planning CMB observations, and for optimizing foreground-cleaning algorithms, a description of the statistical properties of such emission can be helpful. Here we examine a machine learning approach to inferring the statistical properties of dust from either observational data or physics-based simulations. In particular, we apply a type of neural network called a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) to maps of the intensity of emission from interstellar dust as inferred from Planck sky maps and demonstrate its ability to a) simulate new samples with similar summary statistics as the training set, b) provide fits to emission maps withheld from the training set, and c) produce constrained realizations. We find VAEs are easier to train than another popular architecture: that of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and are better-suited for use in Bayesian inference.	
 Proof.			None	We consider methods for transporting a prediction model and assessing its performance for use in a new target population, when outcome and covariate data for model development are available from a simple random sample from the source population, but only covariate data are available from a simple random sample from the target population. We discuss how to tailor the prediction model for use in the target population, how to assess model performance (e.g., by estimating the target population mean squared error), and how to perform model and tuning parameter selection. We provide identifiability results for measures of performance in the target population for a potentially misspecified prediction model under a sampling design where the source and the target population samples are obtained separately. We also introduce the concept of prediction error modifiers that can be used to reason about tailoring measures of model performance to the target population. We illustrate the methods using simulated data.	
 DeepOIS: Gyroscope-Guided Deep Optical Image Stabilizer Compensation	Haipeng ListartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTShuaicheng Liu,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTJue WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMegvii TechnologystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversity of Electronic Science and Technology of China	None	None	Mobile captured images can be aligned using their gyroscope sensors. Optical image stabilizer (OIS) terminates this possibility by adjusting the images during the capturing. In this work, we propose a deep network that compensates the motions caused by the OIS, such that the gyroscopes can be used for image alignment on the OIS cameras 1 1 1 Code will be available on https://github.com/lhaippp/DeepOIS . . To achieve this, first, we record both videos and gyroscopes with an OIS camera as training data. Then, we convert gyroscope readings into motion fields. Second, we propose a Fundamental Mixtures motion model for rolling shutter cameras, where an array of rotations within a frame are extracted as the ground-truth guidance. Third, we train a convolutional neural network with gyroscope motions as input to compensate for the OIS motion. Once finished, the compensation network can be applied for other scenes, where the image alignment is purely based on gyroscopes with no need for images contents, delivering strong robustness. Experiments show that our results are comparable with that of non-OIS cameras, and outperform image-based alignment results with a relatively large margin.	
 A category of quantum posets	Andre Kornell, Bert Lindenhovius, Michael Mislove	akornell@tulane.edu	Department of Computer Science, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana 70118	We investigate a category of quantum posets that generalizes the category of posets and monotone functions. Up to equivalence, its objects are hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebras equipped with quantum partial orders in Weaver‚Äôs sense. We show that this category is complete, cocomplete and symmetric monoidal closed. As a consequence, any discrete quantum family of maps from a discrete quantum space to a partially ordered set is canonically equipped with a quantum preorder. In particular, the quantum power set of a quantum set is canonically a quantum poset. We show that each quantum poset embeds into its quantum power set in complete analogy with the classical case.	
 Bayes-Optimal Convolutional AMP	Keigo Takeuchi	None	None	To improve the convergence property of approximate message-passing (AMP), convolutional AMP (CAMP) has been proposed. CAMP replaces the Onsager correction in AMP with a convolution of messages in all preceding iterations while it uses the same low-complexity matched filter (MF) as AMP. This paper derives state evolution (SE) equations to design the Bayes-optimal denoiser in CAMP. Numerical results imply that CAMP with the Bayes-optimal denoiser‚Äîcalled Bayes-optimal CAMP‚Äîcan achieve the Bayes-optimal performance for right-orthogonally invariant sensing matrices with low-to-moderate condition numbers.	
 Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks with Crossover Based Knowledge Distillation	Junjie Li, Junwei Zhang, Xiaoyu Gong,Shuai	None	None	Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is an adversarial model, and it has been demonstrated to be effective for various generative tasks. However, GAN and its variants also suffer from many training problems, such as mode collapse and gradient vanish. In this paper, we firstly propose a general crossover operator, which can be widely applied to GANs using evolutionary strategies. Then we design an evolutionary GAN framework named C-GAN based on it. And we combine the crossover operator with evolutionary generative adversarial networks (E-GAN) to implement the evolutionary generative adversarial networks with crossover (CE-GAN). Under the premise that a variety of loss functions are used as mutation operators to generate mutation individuals, we evaluate the generated samples and allow the mutation individuals to learn experiences from the output in a knowledge distillation manner, imitating the best output outcome, resulting in better offspring. Then, we greedily select the best offspring as parents for subsequent training using discriminator as an evaluator. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CE-GAN and show that our method is competitive in terms of generated images quality and time efficiency.	
 Influence of fatty alcohol mixing ratios on physicochemical properties of Stearyl-Cetyl-Polysorbate 60-Water ternary System: Insights from Experiments and Computer Simulations	Vu Dang HoangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Cao Phuong CongstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hung Huu TranstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hue Minh Thi NguyenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,and Toan NguyenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	hoangvd@hup.edu.vn	11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Analytical Chemistry and Toxicology, Hanoi University of Pharmacy, 13-15 Le Thanh Tong street, Hanoi, Vietnam	The structure and stability of ternary systems prepared with polysorbate 60 and various combinations of cetyl (C16) and stearyl (C18) alcohols were examined as they aged over 3 months at 25 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C. Rheological results showed that the consistency of these systems increased initially during roughly the first week of aging, which was succeeded by little changes in consistency (systems containing from 30% to 70% C18, with the 50% C18 system showing the highest consistencies) or significant breakdown of structure (remaining systems). The formation and/or disintegration of all ternary systems were also detected by microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry experiments. This study emphasizes the fact that the structure and consistency of ternary systems are dominantly controlled by the swelling capacity of the lamellar gel phase. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide details on the molecular mechanism of stability. Computational results support the hypothesis experimentally proposed for the stability of the mixed system being due to an increase flexibility of the alcohol with a longer hydrocarbon chain. Computational results are in excellent agreement with experimental conclusions. Additionally, they show that in the mixed system, alcohols with shorter hydrocarbon chain become more rigid. These molecular details could not be available in experimental measurements.	
 GymD2D: A Device-to-Device Underlay Cellular Offload Evaluation Platform	David Cotton, Zenon Chaczko	None	None	Cellular offloading in device-to-device communication is a challenging optimisation problem in which the improved allocation of radio resources can increase spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, throughout and reduce latency. The academic community have explored different optimisation methods on these problems and initial results are encouraging. However, there exists significant friction in the lack of a simple, configurable, open-source framework for cellular offload research. Prior research utilises a variety of network simulators and system models, making it difficult to compare results. In this paper we present GymD2D, a framework for experimentation with physical layer resource allocation problems in device-to-device communication. GymD2D allows users to simulate a variety of cellular offload scenarios and to extend its behaviour to meet their research needs. GymD2D provides researchers an evaluation platform to compare, share and build upon previous research. We evaluated GymD2D with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning and demonstrate these algorithms provide significant efficiency improvements.	
 Arbitrary-Oriented Ship Detection through Center-Head Point Extraction	Feng Zhang, Xueying Wang, Shilin Zhou, Yingqian Wang, Yi Hou	None	None	Ship detection in remote sensing images plays a crucial role in various applications and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, existing arbitrary-oriented ship detection methods are generally developed on a set of predefined rotated anchor boxes. These predefined boxes not only lead to inaccurate angle predictions but also introduce extra hyper-parameters and high computational cost. Moreover, the prior knowledge of ship size has not been fully exploited by existing methods, which hinders the improvement of their detection accuracy. Aiming at solving the above issues, in this paper, we propose a center-head point extraction based detector (named CHPDet) to achieve arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images. Our CHPDet formulates arbitrary-oriented ships as rotated boxes with head points which are used to determine the direction. And rotated Gaussian kernel is used to map the annotations into target heatmaps. Keypoint estimation is performed to find the center of ships. Then, the size and head point of the ships are regressed. The orientation-invariant model (OIM) is also used to produce orientation-invariant feature maps. Finally, we use the target size as prior to finetune the results. Moreover, we introduce a new dataset for multi-class arbitrary-oriented ship detection in remote sensing images at a fixed ground sample distance (GSD) which is named FGSD2021. Experimental results on FGSD2021 and two other widely used data sets, i.e., HRSC2016, and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our CHPDet achieves state-of-the-art performance and can well distinguish between bow and stern. Code and FGSD2021 dataset are available at https://github.com/zf020114/CHPDet .	
 Boost-S: Gradient Boosted Trees for Spatial Data and Its Application to FDG-PET Imaging Data	Reza Iranzad, Xiao Liu, Art Chaovalitwongse, Daniel Hippe, Shouyi Wang, Jie Han, Phawis Thammasorn, Chunyan Duan, Jing Zeng, Stephen Bowen	None	None	Boosting Trees are one of the most successful statistical learning approaches that involve sequentially growing an ensemble of simple regression trees (i.e., ‚Äúweak learners‚Äù). This paper proposes a new gradient Boost ed Trees algorithm for S patial Data (Boost-S) for spatially correlated data with covariate information. Boost-S integrates the spatial correlation structure into the classical framework of gradient boosted trees. Each tree is grown by solving a regularized optimization problem, where the objective function involves two penalty terms on tree complexity and takes into account the underlying spatial correlation. A computationally-efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the ensemble trees. The proposed Boost-S is applied to the spatially-correlated FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography) imaging data collected during cancer chemoradiotherapy. Our numerical investigations successfully demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Boost-S over existing approaches for this particular application.

However, for the mass and radius given by Miller et al., no such parameter space exist.

 Equivalence of Non-Perfect Secret Sharing and Symmetric Private Information Retrieval with General Access Structure	SeunghoanSong,andMasahitoHayashi	None	None	We study the equivalence between non-perfect secret sharing (NSS) and symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) with arbitrary response and collusion patterns. NSS and SPIR are defined with an access structure, which corresponds to the authorized/forbidden sets for NSS and the response/collusion patterns for SPIR. We prove the equivalence between NSS and SPIR in the following two senses. 1) Given any SPIR protocol with an access structure, an NSS protocol is constructed with the same access structure and the same rate. 2) Given any linear NSS protocol with an access structure, a linear SPIR protocol is constructed with the same access structure and the same rate. We prove the first relation even if the SPIR protocol has imperfect correctness and secrecy. From the first relation, we derive an upper bound of the SPIR capacity for arbitrary response and collusion patterns. For the special case of ùóá ùóá \mathsf{n} sansserif_n -server SPIR with ùóã ùóã \mathsf{r} sansserif_r responsive and ùóç ùóç \mathsf{t} sansserif_t colluding servers, this upper bound proves that the SPIR capacity is ( ùóã ‚àí ùóç ) / ùóá ùóã ùóç ùóá (\mathsf{r}-\mathsf{t})/\mathsf{n} ( sansserif_r - sansserif_t ) / sansserif_n . From the second relation, we prove that a SPIR protocol exists for any response and collusion patterns.

 Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Shielding	Ingy ElSayedAly, Suda Bharadwaj, Christopher Amato, Rdiger Ehlers, Ufuk Topcu, Lu Feng	ie3ne@virginia.edu	None	Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly used in a wide range of safety-critical applications, which require guaranteed safety (e.g., no unsafe states are ever visited) during the learning process. Unfortunately, current MARL methods do not have safety guarantees. Therefore, we present two shielding approaches for safe MARL. In centralized shielding , we synthesize a single shield to monitor all agents‚Äô joint actions and correct any unsafe action if necessary. In factored shielding , we synthesize multiple shields based on a factorization of the joint state space observed by all agents; the set of shields monitors agents concurrently and each shield is only responsible for a subset of agents at each step. Experimental results show that both approaches can guarantee the safety of agents during learning without compromising the quality of learned policies; moreover, factored shielding is more scalable in the number of agents than centralized shielding.

These predictions are expected to be tested at the LHCb, which can be as a potential research issue with more accumulated experimental data in near future.

 Change point detection and image segmentation for time series of astrophysical images	Cong Xu, Hans Moritz Gnther, Vinay LKashyap, Thomas Lee, Andreas Zezas	None	None	Many astrophysical phenomena are time-varying, in the sense that their intensity, energy spectrum, and/or the spatial distribution of the emission suddenly change. This paper develops a method for modeling a time series of images. Under the assumption that the arrival times of the photons follow a Poisson process, the data are binned into 4D grids of voxels (time, energy band, and x-y coordinates), and viewed as a time series of non-homogeneous Poisson images. The method assumes that at each time point, the corresponding multi-band image stack is an unknown 3D piecewise constant function including Poisson noise. It also assumes that all image stacks between any two adjacent change points (in time domain) share the same unknown piecewise constant function. The proposed method is designed to estimate the number and the locations of all the change points (in time domain), as well as all the unknown piecewise constant functions between any pairs of the change points. The method applies the minimum description length (MDL) principle to perform this task. A practical algorithm is also developed to solve the corresponding complicated optimization problem. Simulation experiments and applications to real datasets show that the proposed method enjoys very promising empirical properties. Applications to two real datasets, the XMM observation of a flaring star and an emerging solar coronal loop, illustrate the usage of the proposed method and the scientific insight gained from it.

FL has received increasing attention in recent years thanks to its data privacy protection, communication efficiency and a linear speedup for convergence in training (i.e., convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of workers). However, existing studies on linear speedup for convergence are only limited to the assumptions of i.i.d. datasets across workers and/or full worker participation, both of which rarely hold in practice. So far, it remains an open question whether or not the linear speedup for convergence is achievable under non-i.i.d. datasets with partial worker participation in FL. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative. Specifically, we show that the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm (with two-sided learning rates) on non-i.i.d. datasets in non-convex settings achieves a convergence rate ùí™ ( 1 m K T + 1 T ) ùí™ 1 ùëö ùêæ ùëá 1 ùëá \mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mKT}}+\frac{1}{T}) caligraphic_O ( divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_m italic_K italic_T end_ARG end_ARG + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_T end_ARG ) for full worker participation and a convergence rate ùí™ ( K n T + 1 T ) ùí™ ùêæ ùëõ ùëá 1 ùëá \mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{K}}{\sqrt{nT}}+\frac{1}{T}) caligraphic_O ( divide start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_K end_ARG end_ARG start_ARG square-root start_ARG italic_n italic_T end_ARG end_ARG + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_T end_ARG ) for partial worker participation, where K ùêæ K italic_K is the number of local steps, T ùëá T italic_T is the number of total communication rounds, m ùëö m italic_m is the total worker number and n ùëõ n italic_n is the worker number in one communication round if for partial worker participation. Our results also reveal that the local steps in FL could help the convergence and show that the maximum number of local steps can be improved to T / m ùëá ùëö T/m italic_T / italic_m in full worker participation. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to verify our theoretical results.	
 Joint Coreference Resolution and Character Linking for Multiparty Conversation	Jiaxin BaistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hongming ZhangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Yangqiu SongstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Kun XustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTCSE, HKUSTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTTencent AI Lab	None	None	Character linking, the task of linking mentioned people in conversations to the real world, is crucial for understanding the conversations. For the efficiency of communication, humans often choose to use pronouns (e.g., ‚Äúshe‚Äù) or normal phrases (e.g., ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù) rather than named entities (e.g., ‚ÄúRachel‚Äù) in the spoken language, which makes linking those mentions to real people a much more challenging than a regular entity linking task. To address this challenge, we propose to incorporate the richer context from the coreference relations among different mentions to help the linking. On the other hand, considering that finding coreference clusters itself is not a trivial task and could benefit from the global character information, we propose to jointly solve these two tasks. Specifically, we propose C 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT , the joint learning model of C oreference resolution and C haracter linking. The experimental results demonstrate that C 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT can significantly outperform previous works on both tasks. Further analyses are conducted to analyze the contribution of all modules in the proposed model and the effect of all hyper-parameters.

 Adversarial Active Learning based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Fake News Detection	Yuxiang Ren,Bo Wang, Jiawei Zhangand Yi Chang	None	None	The explosive growth of fake news along with destructive effects on politics, economy, and public safety has increased the demand for fake news detection. Fake news on social media does not exist independently in the form of an article. Many other entities, such as news creators, news subjects, and so on, exist on social media and have relationships with news articles. Different entities and relationships can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN). In this paper, we attempt to solve the fake news detection problem with the support of a news-oriented HIN. We propose a novel fake news detection framework, namely A dversarial A ctive Learning-based H eterogeneous G raph N eural N etwork ( AA-HGNN ) which employs a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to perform node representation learning in the HIN. AA-HGNN utilizes an active learning framework to enhance learning performance, especially when facing the paucity of labeled data. An adversarial selector will be trained to query high-value candidates for the active learning framework. When the adversarial active learning is completed, AA-HGNN detects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments with two real-world fake news datasets show that our model can outperform text-based models and other graph-based models when using less labeled data benefiting from the adversarial active learning. As a model with generalizability, AA-HGNN also has the ability to be widely used in other node classification-related applications on heterogeneous graphs.

 Statistical guided-waves-based SHM via stochastic non-parametric time series models	Ahmad Amer, Fotis Kopsaftopoulos	None	None	Damage detection in active-sensing, guided-waves-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has evolved through multiple eras of development during the past decades. Nevertheless, there still exists a number of challenges facing the current state-of-the-art approaches, both in the industry as well as in research and development, including low damage sensitivity, lack of robustness to uncertainties, need for user-defined thresholds, and non-uniform response across a sensor network. In this work, a novel statistical framework is proposed for active-sensing SHM based on the use of ultrasonic guided waves. This framework is based on stochastic non-parametric time series models and their corresponding statistical properties in order to readily provide healthy confidence bounds and enable accurate and robust damage detection via the use of appropriate statistical decision making tests. Three such methods and corresponding statistical quantities (test statistics) along with decision making schemes are formulated and experimentally assessed via the use of three coupons with different levels of complexity: an Al plate with a growing notch, a Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) plate with added weights to simulate local damages, and the CFRP panel used in the Open Guided Waves project [ 1 ] , all fitted with piezoelectric transducers and a pitch-catch configuration. The performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of state-of-the-art time-domain damage indices (DIs). The results demonstrate the increased sensitivity and robustness of the proposed methods, with better tracking capability of damage evolution compared to conventional approaches, even for damage-non-intersecting actuator-sensor paths. In particular, the Z ùëç Z italic_Z statistic emerges as the best damage detection metric compared to conventional DIs, as well as the other proposed statistics. This is attributed to the incorporation of experimental uncertainty in defining the Z ùëç Z italic_Z statistic, which results in a both sensitive and robust approach for damage detection. Overall, the proposed statistical methods exhibit greater damage sensitivity across different components, with enhanced robustness to uncertainty, as well as user-friendly application.	
 Impurity induced quantum chaos for an ultracold bosonic ensemble in a double-well	Jie Chen, Kevin Keiler, Gao Xianlong, Peter Schmelcher	jie.chen@physnet.uni-hamburg.de	None	We demonstrate that an ultracold many-body bosonic ensemble confined in a one-dimensional (1D) double-well (DW) potential can exhibit chaotic dynamics due to the presence of a single impurity. The non-equilibrium dynamics is triggered by a quench of the impurity-Bose interaction and is illustrated via the evolution of the population imbalance for the bosons between the two wells. While the increase of the post-quench interaction strength always facilitates the irregular motion for the bosonic population imbalance, it becomes regular again when the impurity is initially populated in the highly excited states. Such an integrability to chaos (ITC) transition is fully captured by the transient dynamics of the corresponding linear entanglement entropy, whose infinite-time averaged value additionally characterizes the edge of the chaos and implies the existence of an effective Bose-Bose attraction induced by the impurity. In order to elucidate the physical origin for the observed ITC transition, we perform a detailed spectral analysis for the mixture with respect to both the energy spectrum as well as the eigenstates. Specifically, two distinguished spectral behaviors upon a variation of the interspecies interaction strength are observed. While the avoided level-crossings take place in the low-energy spectrum, the energy levels in the high-energy spectrum possess a band-like structure and are equidistant within each band. This leads to a significant delocalization of the low-lying eigenvectors which, in turn, accounts for the chaotic nature of the bosonic dynamics. By contrast, those highly excited states bear a high resemblance to the non-interacting integrable basis, which explains for the recovery of the integrability for the bosonic species. Finally, we discuss the induced Bose-Bose attraction as well as its impact on the bosonic dynamics.	
 Dielectric slot-coupled half-Maxwell fisheye lens as octave-bandwidth beam expander for terahertz-range applications	Daniel Headland,Andreas KKlein,Masayuki Fujita,andTadao Nagatsuma,	None	None	We present a paradigm for integrated photonic devices based upon broadband slab-confined collimated beams that are launched with half-Maxwell fisheye lenses. Although it is challenging to match to the low-index focus of the lens whilst maintaining adequate field confinement for a well-defined point source, integrated dielectric slot waveguides prove highly suitable, yielding collimators of 90% efficiency and over one octave bandwidth. Terahertz technology will benefit from such broadband slab-confined beams to replace free-space optics, toward compact, mass-producible systems that do not require manual optical alignment. We present two prototype systems to demonstrate the versatility of this concept, namely a diagonally-set distributed Bragg reflector as frequency-division diplexer for terahertz communications, and an attenuated total reflection-based liquid sensor. Both are enabled by oblique in-slab reflections that are collected at a location other than the originating lens, which is not attainable using ordinary single-mode channel waveguides.	
 Harvest: A Reliable and Energy Efficient Bulk Data Collection Service for Large Scale Wireless Sensor Networks	Vinayak NaikAnish Arora	vinayak@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in	BITS Pilani, Goa	We present a bulk data collection service, Harvest, for energy constrained wireless sensor nodes. To increase spatial reuse and thereby decrease latency, Harvest performs concurrent, pipelined exfiltration from multiple nodes to a base station. To this end, it uses a distance-k coloring of the nodes, notably with a constant number of colors, which yields a TDMA schedule whereby nodes can communicate concurrently with low packet losses due to collision. This coloring is based on a randomized CSMA approach which does not exploit location knowledge. Given a bounded degree of the network, each node waits only O ( 1 ) 1 (1) ( 1 ) time to obtain a unique color among its distance-k neighbors, in contrast to the traditional deterministic distributed distance-k vertex coloring wherein each node waits O ( Œî 2 ) superscript normal-Œî 2 (\Delta^{2}) ( roman_Œî start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) time to obtain a color.	
 \FGETHR: Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing via Refinement in Hyperbolic Space	Muhammad Asif Ali,Yifang Sun,Bing Li,Wei Wang,School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW, AustraliaThe Hong Kong university of Science and Technology, Chinamuhammadasifali, bingli, yifangsunsweduau, weiwcsusthk	None	None	Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing ( FG-NET ) aims at classifying the entity mentions into a wide range of entity types (usually hundreds) depending upon the context. While distant supervision is the most common way to acquire supervised training data, it brings in label noise, as it assigns type labels to the entity mentions irrespective of mentions‚Äô context. In attempts to deal with the label noise, leading research on the FG-NET assumes that the fine-grained entity typing data possesses a euclidean nature, which restraints the ability of the existing models in combating the label noise. Given the fact that the fine-grained type hierarchy exhibits a hierarchical structure, it makes hyperbolic space a natural choice to model the FG-NET data. In this research, we propose \FGETHR , a novel framework that benefits from the hyperbolic geometry in combination with the graph structures to perform entity typing in a performance-enhanced fashion. \FGETHR initially uses LSTM networks to encode the mention in relation with its context, later it forms a graph to distill/refine the mention‚Äôs encodings in the hyperbolic space. Finally, the refined mention encoding is used for entity typing. Experimentation using different benchmark datasets shows that \FGETHR improves the performance on FG-NET by up to 3.5% in terms of strict accuracy.	
 Mobility Edges in one-dimensional Models with quasi-periodic disorder	Qiyun Tang, Yan He	None	None	We study the mobility edges in a variety of one-dimensional tight binding models with slowly varying quasi-periodic disorders. It is found that the quasi-periodic disordered models can be approximated by an ensemble of periodic models. The mobility edges can be determined by the overlaps of the energy bands of these periodic models. We demonstrate that this method provides an efficient way to find out the precise location of mobility edge in qusi-periodic disordered models. Based on this approximate method, we also propose an index to indicate the degree of localization of each eigenstate.	
 Towards Robustness to Label Noise in Text Classification via Noise Modeling	Siddhant Garg, Goutham Ramakrishnan, Varun Thumbe	sidgarg@amazon.com	None	Large datasets in NLP tend to suffer from noisy labels due to erroneous automatic and human annotation procedures. We study the problem of text classification with label noise, and aim to capture this noise through an auxiliary noise model over the classifier. We first assign a probability score to each training sample of having a clean or noisy label, using a two-component beta mixture model fitted on the training losses at an early epoch. Using this, we jointly train the classifier and the noise model through a novel de-noising loss having two components: (i) cross-entropy of the noise model prediction with the input label, and (ii) cross-entropy of the classifier prediction with the input label, weighted by the probability of the sample having a clean label. Our empirical evaluation on two text classification tasks and two types of label noise: random and input-conditional, shows that our approach can improve classification accuracy, and prevent over-fitting to the noise.	
 How does an external electric field trigger the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition on a textured surface?	Ke XiaodaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Xi ChendaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and ChenXu Wu	cxwu@xmu.edu.cn	None	Understanding the critical condition and mechanism of the droplet wetting transition between Cassie-Baxter state and Wenzel state triggered by an external electric field is of considerable importance because of its numerous applications in industry and engineering. However, such a wetting transition on a patterned surface is still not fully understood, e.g., the effects of electro-wetting number, geometry of the patterned surfaces, and droplet volume on the transition have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model for the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition triggered by applying an external voltage on a droplet placed on a mirco-pillared surface or a porous substrate. It is found that the transition is realized by lowering the energy barrier created by the intermediate composite state considerably, which enables the droplet to cross the energy barrier and complete the transition process. Our calculations also indicate that for fixed droplet volume, the critical electrowetting number (voltage) will increase (decrease) along with the surface roughness for a micro-pillar patterned (porous) surface, and if the surface roughness is fixed, a small droplet tends to ease the critical electrowetting condition for the transition. Besides, three dimensional phase diagrams in terms of electrowetting number, surface roughness, and droplet volume are constructed to illustrate the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition. Our theoretical model can be used to explain the previous experimental results about the Cassie-Baxter-Wenzel wetting transition reported in the literature.	
 PPT: Parsimonious Parser Transfer for Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Adaptation	Kemal KurniawanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTLea FrermannstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPhilip SchulzstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTTrevor CohnstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSchool of Computing and Information Systems, University of MelbournestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTAmazon Research	None	None	Cross-lingual transfer is a leading technique for parsing low-resource languages in the absence of explicit supervision. Simple ‚Äòdirect transfer‚Äô of a learned model based on a multilingual input encoding has provided a strong benchmark. This paper presents a method for unsupervised cross-lingual transfer that improves over direct transfer systems by using their output as implicit supervision as part of self-training on unlabelled text in the target language. The method assumes minimal resources and provides maximal flexibility by (a) accepting any pre-trained arc-factored dependency parser; (b) assuming no access to source language data; (c) supporting both projective and non-projective parsing; and (d) supporting multi-source transfer. With English as the source language, we show significant improvements over state-of-the-art transfer models on both distant and nearby languages, despite our conceptually simpler approach. We provide analyses of the choice of source languages for multi-source transfer, and the advantage of non-projective parsing.

 What We Can Learn From Visual Artists About Software Development	Jingyi Li, Sonia Hashim, Jennifer Jacobs	None	None	This paper explores software‚Äôs role in visual art production by examining how artists use and develop software. We conducted interviews with professional artists who were collaborating with software developers, learning software development, and building and maintaining software. We found artists were motivated to learn software development for intellectual growth and access to technical communities. Artists valued efficient workflows through skilled manual execution and personal software development, but avoided high-level forms of software automation. Artists identified conflicts between their priorities and those of professional developers and computational art communities, which influenced how they used computational aesthetics in their work. These findings contribute to efforts in systems engineering research to integrate end-user programming and creativity support across software and physical media, suggesting opportunities for artists as collaborators. Artists‚Äô experiences writing software can guide technical implementations of domain-specific representations, and their experiences in interdisciplinary production can aid inclusive community building around computational tools.	
 The gradient flow for entropy on closed planar curves	Lachlann ODonnell and Glen Wheeler and ValentinaMira Wheeler	glenw,vwheeler,lachlann@uow.edu.au	University of WollongongNorthfields Ave2522 NSW, Australia	In this paper we consider the steepest descent L 2 superscript ùêø 2 L^{2} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -gradient flow of the entropy functional. The flow expands convex curves, with the radius of an initial circle growing like the square root of time.

 Coherent dynamics of multi-spin V_B‚Åª centers in hexagonal boron nitride	Wei Liu, Viktor Ivdy, ZhiPeng Li, YuanZe Yang, Shang Yu, Yu Meng, ZhaoAn Wang, NaiJie Guo, FeiFei Yan, Qiang Li, JunFeng Wang, JinShi Xu, Xiao Liu, ZongQuan Zhou, Yang Dong, XiangDong Chen, FangWen Sun, YiTao Wang, JianShun Tang, Adam Gali, ChuanFeng Li, GuangCan Guo	None	None	Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been demonstrated to contain optically polarized and detected electron spins that can be utilized for implementing qubits and quantum sensors in nanolayered-devices. Understanding the coherent dynamics of microwave driven spins in hBN is of crucial importance for advancing these emerging new technologies. Here, we demonstrate and study the Rabi oscillation and related dynamical phenomena of the negatively charged boron vacancy ( V B ‚àí superscript subscript V B \rm V_{B}^{-} roman_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) spins in hBN. We report on different dynamics of the V B ‚àí superscript subscript V B \rm V_{B}^{-} roman_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT spins at weak and strong magnetic fields. In the former case the defect behaves like a single electron spin system, while in the latter case it behaves like a multi-spin system exhibiting the multiple-frequency dynamical oscillation like clear beat in Ramsey fringes. We also carry out theoretical simulations for the spin dynamics of V B ‚àí superscript subscript V B \rm V_{B}^{-} roman_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and reveal that the nuclear spins can be driven via the strong electric-nuclear coupling existing in V B ‚àí superscript subscript V B \rm V_{B}^{-} roman_V start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_B end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT center, which can be modulated by the magnetic field and microwave field.	
 Learning Task-agnostic Representation via Toddler-inspired Learning	Kwanyoung ParkJunseok ParkHyunseok OhByoungTak ZhangYoungki LeeDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering, AI Institute AIISSeoul National University, Seoul , South Korea	None	None	One of the inherent limitations of current AI systems, stemming from the passive learning mechanisms (e.g., supervised learning), is that they perform well on labeled datasets but cannot deduce knowledge on their own. To tackle this problem, we derive inspiration from a highly intentional learning system via action: the toddler. Inspired by the toddler‚Äôs learning procedure, we design an interactive agent that can learn and store task-agnostic visual representation while exploring and interacting with objects in the virtual environment. Experimental results show that such obtained representation was expandable to various vision tasks such as image classification, object localization, and distance estimation tasks. In specific, the proposed model achieved 100%, 75.1% accuracy and 1.62% relative error, respectively, which is noticeably better than autoencoder-based model (99.7%, 66.1%, 1.95%), and also comparable with those of supervised models (100%, 87.3%, 0.71%).

 Multi-Instance Pose Networks: Rethinking Top-Down Pose Estimation	Rawal KhirodkarVisesh ChariAmit AgrawalAmbrish TyagiCarnegie Mellon UniversityAmazon Lab httpsrawalkhirodkargithubiomipnet	None	None	A key assumption of top-down human pose estimation approaches is their expectation of having a single person/instance present in the input bounding box. This often leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. We propose a novel solution to overcome the limitations of this fundamental assumption. Our Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) allows for predicting multiple 2D pose instances within a given bounding box. We introduce a Multi-Instance Modulation Block (MIMB) that can adaptively modulate channel-wise feature responses for each instance and is parameter efficient. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating on COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets. Specifically, we achieve 70.0 70.0 70.0 70.0 AP on CrowdPose and 42.5 42.5 42.5 42.5 AP on OCHuman test sets, a significant improvement of 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 AP and 6.5 6.5 6.5 6.5 AP over the prior art, respectively. When using ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIPNet achieves an improvement of 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 AP on COCO, 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 AP on CrowdPose, and 9.1 9.1 9.1 9.1 AP on OCHuman validation sets compared to HRNet. Interestingly, when fewer, high confidence bounding boxes are used, HRNet‚Äôs performance degrades (by 5 5 5 5 AP) on OCHuman, whereas MIPNet maintains a relatively stable performance (drop of 1 1 1 1 AP) for the same inputs.	
 Reciprocal Landmark Detection and Tracking with Extremely Few Annotations	Jianzhe Lin, Student Member, IEEE, Ghazal Sahebzamani, Student Member, IEEE, Christina Luong, Fatemeh Taheri Dezaki, Student Member, IEEE, Mohammad Jafari, Student Member, IEEE, Purang Abolmaesumi, Fellow, IEEE, and Teresa Tsang	None	None	Localization of anatomical landmarks to perform two-dimensional measurements in echocardiography is part of routine clinical workflow in cardiac disease diagnosis. Automatic localization of those landmarks is highly desirable to improve workflow and reduce interobserver variability. Training a machine learning framework to perform such localization is hindered given the sparse nature of gold standard labels; only few percent of cardiac cine series frames are normally manually labeled for clinical use. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end reciprocal detection and tracking model that is specifically designed to handle the sparse nature of echocardiography labels. The model is trained using few annotated frames across the entire cardiac cine sequence to generate consistent detection and tracking of landmarks, and an adversarial training for the model is proposed to take advantage of these annotated frames. The superiority of the proposed reciprocal model is demonstrated using a series of experiments.

Here, CHL of the 2 p ùëù p italic_p state of W atom is manipulated experimentally through adjusting the emission rate of a resonant fluorescence channel with the assistance of an x-ray thin-film planar cavity. The emission rate is accelerated by a factor linearly proportional to the cavity field amplitude, that can be directly controlled by choosing different cavity modes or changing the angle offset in experiment. This experimental observation is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. It is found that the manipulated resonant fluorescence channel even can dominate the CHL. The controllable CHL realized here will facilitate the nonlinear investigations and modern x-ray scattering techniques in hard x-ray region.

 Bayesian Paired Comparison with the bpcs package			None	This article introduces the bpcs R package (Bayesian Paired Comparison in Stan) and the statistical models implemented in the package. This package aims to facilitate the use of Bayesian models for paired comparison data in behavioral research. Bayesian analysis of paired comparison data allows parameter estimation even in conditions where the maximum likelihood does not exist, allows easy extension of paired comparison models, provide straightforward interpretation of the results with credible intervals, have better control of type I error, have more robust evidence towards the null hypothesis, allows propagation of uncertainties, includes prior information, and perform well when handling models with many parameters and latent variables. The bpcs package provides a consistent interface for R users and several functions to evaluate the posterior distribution of all parameters, to estimate the posterior distribution of any contest between items, and to obtain the posterior distribution of the ranks. Three reanalyses of recent studies that used the frequentist Bradley-Terry model are presented. These reanalyses are conducted with the Bayesian models of the bpcs package, and all the code used to fit the models, generate the figures, and the tables are available in the online appendix.	
 GaitGraph: Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Gait Recognition			None	Gait recognition is a promising video-based biometric for identifying individual walking patterns from a long distance. At present, most gait recognition methods use silhouette images to represent a person in each frame. However, silhouette images can lose fine-grained spatial information, and most papers do not regard how to obtain these silhouettes in complex scenes. Furthermore, silhouette images contain not only gait features but also other visual clues that can be recognized. Hence these approaches can not be considered as strict gait recognition.

 Designing for Engaging with News using Moral Framing towards Bridging Ideological Divides	Jessica Wang, Amy Zhang, David Karger	jzwang@mit.edu	None	Society is showing signs of strong ideological polarization. When pushed to seek perspectives different from their own, people often reject diverse ideas or find them unfathomable. Work has shown that framing controversial issues using the values of the audience can improve understanding of opposing views. In this paper, we present our work designing systems for addressing ideological division through educating U.S. news consumers to engage using a framework of fundamental human values known as Moral Foundations. We design and implement a series of new features that encourage users to challenge their understanding of opposing views, including annotation of moral frames in news articles, discussion of those frames via inline comments, and recommendations based on relevant moral frames. We describe two versions of features‚Äîthe first covering a suite of ways to interact with moral framing in news, and the second tailored towards collaborative annotation and discussion. We conduct a field evaluation of each design iteration with 71 participants in total over a period of 6-8 days, finding evidence suggesting users learned to re-frame their discourse in moral values of the opposing side. Our work provides several design considerations for building systems to engage with moral framing.	
 Scalable ùëä-type entanglement resource in neutral-atom arrays with Rydberg-dressed resonant dipole-dipole interaction	Vladimir Stojanovi	None	None	While the Rydberg-blockade regime provides the natural setting for creating W ùëä W italic_W -type entanglement with cold neutral atoms, it is demonstrated here that a scalable entanglement resource of this type can even be obtained under completely different physical circumstances. To be more precise, a special instance of twisted W ùëä W italic_W states ‚Äì namely, œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ -twisted ones ‚Äì can be engineered in one-dimensional arrays of cold neutral atoms with Rydberg-dressed resonant dipole-dipole interaction. In particular, it is shown here that this is possible even when a (dressed) Rydberg excitation is coupled to the motional degrees of freedom of atoms in their respective, nearly-harmonic optical-dipole microtraps, which are quantized into dispersionless (zero-dimensional) bosons. For a specially chosen (‚Äúsweet-spot‚Äù) detuning of the off-resonant dressing lasers from the relevant internal atomic transitions, the desired œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ -twisted W ùëä W italic_W state of Rydberg-dressed qubits is the ground state of the effective excitation ‚Äì boson Hamiltonian of the system in a broad window of the relevant parameters. Being at the same time separated from the other eigenstates by a gap equal to the single-boson energy, this W ùëä W italic_W state can be prepared using a Rabi-type driving protocol. The corresponding preparation times are independent of the system size and several orders of magnitude shorter than the effective lifetimes of the relevant atomic states.

 Classical simulation of lossy boson sampling using matrix product operators	Changhun Oh, Kyungjoo Noh, Bill Fefferman, Liang Jiang	None	None	Characterizing the computational advantage from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is an important task from theoretical and practical perspectives. Here, we numerically investigate the computational power of NISQ devices focusing on boson sampling, one of the well-known promising problems which can exhibit quantum supremacy. We study hardness of lossy boson sampling using matrix product operator (MPO) simulation to address the effect of photon-loss on classical simulability using MPO entanglement entropy (EE), which characterizes a running time of an MPO algorithm. An advantage of MPO simulation over other classical algorithms proposed to date is that its simulation accuracy can be efficiently controlled by increasing an MPO‚Äôs bond dimension. Notably, we show by simulating lossy boson sampling using an MPO that as an input photon number grows, its computational cost, or MPO EE, behaves differently depending on a loss-scaling, exhibiting a different feature from that of lossless boson sampling. Especially when an output photon number scales faster than the square root of an input photon number, our study shows an exponential scaling of time complexity for MPO simulation. On the contrary, when an output photon number scales slower than the square root of an input photon number, MPO EE may decrease, indicating that an exponential time complexity might not be necessary.

 R√©nyi Entropy Dynamics and Lindblad Spectrum for Open Quantum System	YiNeng Zhou, Liang Mao, Hui Zhai	None	None	In this letter we point out that the Lindblad spectrum of a quantum many-body system displays a segment structure and exhibits two different energy scales in the strong dissipation regime. One energy scale determines the separation between different segments, being proportional to the dissipation strength, and the other energy scale determines the broadening of each segment, being inversely proportional to the dissipation strength. Ultilizing a relation between the dynamics of the second R√©nyi entropy and the Lindblad spectrum, we show that these two energy scales respectively determine the short- and the long-time dynamics of the second R√©nyi entropy starting from a generic initial state. This gives rise to opposite behaviors, that is, as the dissipation strength increases, the short-time dynamics becomes faster and the long-time dynamics becomes slower. We also interpret the quantum Zeno effect as specific initial states that only occupy the Lindblad spectrum around zero, for which only the broadening energy scale of the Lindblad spectrum matters and gives rise to suppressed dynamics with stronger dissipation. We illustrate our theory with two concrete models that can be experimentally verified.	
 A Game Theory Based Ramp Merging Strategy for Connected and Automated Vehicles in the Mixed Traffic: A Unity-SUMO Integrated Platform			None		
 Page Curve from Non-Markovianity	Kaixiang Su, Pengfei Zhang, Hui Zhai	None	None	In this letter, we use the exactly solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to address the issue of entropy dynamics when an interacting quantum system is coupled to a non-Markovian environment. We find that at the initial stage, the entropy always increases linearly matching the Markovian result. When the system thermalizes with the environment at a sufficiently long time, if the environment temperature is low and the coupling between system and environment is weak, then the total thermal entropy is low and the entanglement between system and environment is also weak, which yields a small system entropy in the long-time steady state. This manifestation of non-Markovian effects of the environment forces the entropy to decrease in the later stage, which yields the Page curve for the entropy dynamics. We argue that this physical scenario revealed by the exact solution of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model is universally applicable for general chaotic quantum many-body systems and can be verified experimentally in near future.	
 Im2Mesh GAN: Accurate 3D Hand Mesh Recovery from a Single RGB Image	Akila Pemasiri Kien Nguyen Thanh Sridha Sridharan Clinton FookesSpeech, Audio, Image and Video Technology SAIVT LaboratoryQueensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia	None	None	This work addresses hand mesh recovery from a single RGB image. In contrast to most of the existing approaches where the parametric hand models are employed as the prior, we show that the hand mesh can be learned directly from the input image. We propose a new type of GAN called Im2Mesh GAN to learn the mesh through end-to-end adversarial training. By interpreting the mesh as a graph, our model is able to capture the topological relationship among the mesh vertices. We also introduce a 3D surface descriptor into the GAN architecture to further capture the 3D features associated. We experiment two approaches where one can reap the benefits of coupled groundtruth data availability of images and the corresponding meshes, while the other combats the more challenging problem of mesh estimations without the corresponding groundtruth. Through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.	
 Long time dynamics of a single particle extended quantum walk on a one dimensional lattice with complex hoppings: a generalized hydrodynamic description	Hemlata Bhandari, Durganandini	None	None	We study the continuous time quantum walk of a single particle (initially localized at a single site) on a one-dimensional spatial lattice with complex nearest neighbour and next-nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes. Complex couplings lead to chiral propagation and a causal cone structure asymmetric about the origin. We provide a hydrodynamic description for quantum walk dynamics in large space time limit. We find a global ‚Äùquasi-stationary state‚Äù which can be described in terms of the local quasi-particle densities satisfying Euler type of hydrodynamic equation and is characterized by an infinite set of conservation laws satisfied by scaled cumulative position moments. Further, we show that there is anomalous sub-diffusive scaling near the extremal fronts, which can be described by higher order hydrodynamic equations. The long time behaviour for any complex next-nearest neighbour hopping with a non-zero real component is similar to that of purely real hopping (apart from asymmetric distribution). There is a critical coupling strength at which there is a Lifshitz transition where the topology of the causal structure changes from a regime with one causal cone to a regime with two nested causal cones. On the other hand, for purely imaginary next-nearest neighbour hopping, there is a transition from one causal cone to a regime with two partially overlapping cones due to the existence of degenerate maximal fronts (moving with the same maximal velocity). The nature of the Lifshitz transition and the scaling behaviour (both) at the critical coupling strength is different in the two cases.	
 Smooth Attitude Tracking Control of a 3-DOF Helicopter with Guaranteed Performance	Xidong Wang	None	None	This paper presents a new prescribed performance control scheme for the attitude tracking of the three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) helicopter system with lumped disturbances under mechanical constraints. First, a novel prescribed performance function is defined to guarantee that the tracking error performance has a small overshoot in the transient process and converges to an arbitrary small region within a predetermined time in the steady-state process without knowing the initial tracking error in advance. Then, based on the novel prescribed performance function, an error transformation combined with the smooth finite-time control method we proposed before is employed to drive the elevation and pitch angles to track given desired trajectories with guaranteed tracking performance. The theoretical analysis of finite-time Lyapunov stability indicates that the closed-loop system is fast finite-time uniformly ultimately boundedness. Finally, comparative experiment results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.

 Convolutional Neural Network-Based Age Estimation Using B-Mode Ultrasound Tongue Image			None	Ultrasound tongue imaging is widely used for speech production research, and it has attracted increasing attention as its potential applications seem to be evident in many different fields, such as the visual biofeedback tool for second language acquisition and silent speech interface. Unlike previous studies, here we explore the feasibility of age estimation using the ultrasound tongue image of the speakers. Motivated by the success of deep learning, this paper leverages deep learning on this task. We train a deep convolutional neural network model on the UltraSuite dataset. The deep model achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.03 for the data from typically developing children, while MAE is 4.87 for the data from the children with speech sound disorders, which suggest that age estimation using ultrasound is more challenging for the children with speech sound disorder. The developed method can be used a tool to evaluate the performance of speech therapy sessions. It is also worthwhile to notice that, although we leverage the ultrasound tongue imaging for our study, the proposed methods may also be extended to other imaging modalities (e.g. MRI) to assist the studies on speech production.	
 A Survey on 5G Radio Access Network Energy Efficiency: Massive MIMO, Lean Carrier Design, Sleep Modes, and Machine Learning	David LpezPrez, Antonio De Domenico, Nicola Piovesan, Geng Xinli, Harvey Bao, Song Qitao and Mrouane Debbah	None	None	Cellular networks have changed the world we are living in, and the fifth generation (5G) of radio technology is expected to further revolutionise our everyday lives, by enabling a high degree of automation, through its larger capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-reliable low-latency communications. In addition, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) specification also provides tools to significantly decrease the energy consumption and the green house emissions of next generations networks, thus contributing towards information and communication technology (ICT) sustainability targets. In this survey paper, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art on current energy efficiency research. We first categorise and carefully analyse the different power consumption models and energy efficiency metrics, which have helped to make progress on the understanding of green networks. Then, as a main contribution, we survey in detail ‚Äîfrom a theoretical and a practical viewpoint‚Äî the main energy efficiency enabling technologies that 3GPP NR provides, together with their main benefits and challenges. Special attention is paid to four key enabling technologies, i.e., massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), lean carrier design, and advanced idle modes, together with the role of artificial intelligence capabilities. We dive into their implementation and operational details, and thoroughly discuss their optimal operation points and theoretical-trade-offs from an energy consumption perspective. This will help the reader to grasp the fundamentals of ‚Äîand the status on‚Äî green networking. Finally, the areas of research where more effort is needed to make future networks greener are also discussed.

LiHua SongstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPengQi WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTYinJie ZhangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	By globally analyzing nuclear Drell-Yan data including all incident energies, the nuclear effects of nPDFs and initial-state parton energy loss are investigated. Based on Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) regime, the calculations are carried out by means of the analytic parametrizations of quenching weights derived from the Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peign e ¬¥ ¬¥ ùëí \acute{e} over¬¥ start_ARG italic_e end_ARG -Schiff (BDMPS) formalism and using the new EPPS16 nPDFs.

The nuclear effects of nPDFs becomes more obvious with the nuclear mass number A, the same as the energy loss effect.

 Efficient Video Summarization Framework using EEG and Eye-tracking Signals	SaiSukruthBezugam,SwatilekhaMajumdar, ChetanRalekarandTapanKumarGandhistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	This paper proposes an efficient video summarization framework that will give a gist of the entire video in a few key-frames or video skims. Existing video summarization frameworks are based on algorithms that utilize computer vision low-level feature extraction or high-level domain level extraction. However, being the ultimate user of the summarized video, humans remain the most neglected aspect. Therefore, the proposed paper considers human‚Äôs role in summarization and introduces human visual attention-based summarization techniques. To understand human attention behavior, we have designed and performed experiments with human participants using electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking technology. The EEG and eye-tracking data obtained from the experimentation are processed simultaneously and used to segment frames containing useful information from a considerable video volume. Thus, the frame segmentation primarily relies on the cognitive judgments of human beings. Using our approach, a video is summarized by ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 96.5% while maintaining higher precision ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 0.98) and high recall factors ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 0.97). The comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates that the proposed approach yields ceiling-level performance with reduced computational cost in summarising the videos.

 e-ACJ: Accurate Junction extraction for event cameras			None	Junctions reflect the important geometrical structure information of the image, and are of primary significance to applications such as image matching and motion analysis. Previous event-based feature extraction methods are mainly focused on corners, which mainly find their locations, however, ignoring the geometrical structure information like orientations and scales of edges. This paper adapts the frame-based a-contrario junction detector(ACJ) to event data, proposing the event-based a-contrario junction detector(e-ACJ), which yields junctions‚Äô locations while giving the scales and orientations of their branches. The proposed method relies on an a-contrario model and can operate on asynchronous events directly without generating synthesized event frames. We evaluate the performance on public event datasets. The result shows our method successfully finds the orientations and scales of branches, while maintaining high accuracy in junction‚Äôs location.	
 Segmentation of common and internal carotid arteries from 3D ultrasound images using adaptive triple U-Net	Mingjie JiangDepartment of Electrical EngineeringCity University of Hong KongHong KongYuan ZhaoDepartment of Electrical EngineeringCity University of Hong KongHong KongBernard ChiuDepartment of Electrical EngineeringCity University of Hong KongHong Kong	None	None	Objective : Vessel-wall-volume (VWV) and localized vessel-wall-thickness (VWT) measured from 3D ultrasound (US) carotid images are sensitive to anti-atherosclerotic effects of medical/dietary treatments. VWV and VWT measurements require the lumen-intima (LIB) and media-adventitia boundaries (MAB) at the common and internal carotid arteries (CCA and ICA). However, most existing segmentation techniques were capable of automating only CCA segmentation. An approach capable of segmenting the MAB and LIB from the CCA and ICA was required to accelerate VWV and VWT quantification.

 Automatic Segmentation of Gross Target Volume of Nasopharynx Cancer using Ensemble of Multiscale Deep Neural Networks with Spatial Attention	Haochen Mei, Wenhui Lei, Ran Gu, Shan Ye, Zhengwentai Sun, Shichuan Zhang, Guotai Wang	None	School¬†of¬† Mechanical¬† and¬† Electrical ¬†Engineering, ¬†University¬† of¬† Electronic ¬†Science¬† and ¬†Technology ¬†of ¬†China,¬† Chengdu,¬† China	Radiotherapy is the main treatment method for nasopharynx cancer. Delineation of Gross Target Volume (GTV) from medical images is a prerequisite for radiotherapy. As manual delineation is time-consuming and laborious, automatic segmentation of GTV has a potential to improve the efficiency of this process. This work aims to automatically segment GTV of nasopharynx cancer from Computed Tomography (CT) images. However, it is challenged by the small target region, anisotropic resolution of clinical CT images, and the low contrast between the target region and surrounding soft tissues. To deal with these problems, we propose a 2.5D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to handle the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions. We also propose a spatial attention module to enable the network to focus on the small target, and use channel attention to further improve the segmentation performance. Moreover, we use a multi-scale sampling method for training so that the networks can learn features at different scales, which are combined with a multi-model ensemble method to improve the robustness of segmentation results. We also estimate the uncertainty of segmentation results based on our model ensemble, which is of great importance for indicating the reliability of automatic segmentation results for radiotherapy planning. Experiments with 2019 MICCAI StructSeg dataset showed that (1) Our proposed 2.5D network has a better performance on images with anisotropic resolution than the commonly used 3D networks. (2) Our attention mechanism can make the network pay more attention to the small GTV region and improve the segmentation accuracy. (3) The proposed multi-scale model ensemble achieves more robust results, and it can simultaneously obtain uncertainty information that can indicate potential mis-segmentations for better clinical decisions.	
 Demographic feedbacks can hamper the spatial spread of a gene drive	Lo Girardin, Florence Dbarre	leo.girardin@math.cnrs.fr	CNRS, Institut Camille Jordan, Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon-1, 43 boulevard du 11 novembre 1918, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France	This paper is concerned with a reaction‚Äìdiffusion system modeling the fixation and the invasion in a population of a gene drive (an allele biasing inheritance, increasing its own transmission to offspring). In our model, the gene drive has a negative effect on the fitness of individuals carrying it, and is therefore susceptible of decreasing the total carrying capacity of the population locally in space. This tends to generate an opposing demographic advection that the gene drive has to overcome in order to invade. While previous reaction‚Äìdiffusion models neglected this aspect, here we focus on it and try to predict the sign of the traveling wave speed. It turns out to be an analytical challenge, only partial results being within reach, and we complete our theoretical analysis by numerical simulations. Our results indicate that taking into account the interplay between population dynamics and population genetics might actually be crucial, as it can effectively reverse the direction of the invasion and lead to failure. Our findings can be extended to other bistable systems, such as the spread of cytoplasmic incompatibilities caused by Wolbachia.	
 Partition of unity networks: deep hp-approximation	Kookjin Lee,Nathaniel Trask,Ravi Patel,Mamikon Gulian,Eric Cyr	None	None	Approximation theorists have established best-in-class optimal approximation rates of deep neural networks by utilizing their ability to simultaneously emulate partitions of unity and monomials. Motivated by this, we propose partition of unity networks (POUnets) which incorporate these elements directly into the architecture. Classification architectures of the type used to learn probability measures are used to build a meshfree partition of space, while polynomial spaces with learnable coefficients are associated to each partition. The resulting h p ‚Ñé ùëù hp italic_h italic_p -element-like approximation allows use of a fast least-squares optimizer, and the resulting architecture size need not scale exponentially with spatial dimension, breaking the curse of dimensionality. An abstract approximation result establishes desirable properties to guide network design. Numerical results for two choices of architecture demonstrate that POUnets yield h p ‚Ñé ùëù hp italic_h italic_p -convergence for smooth functions and consistently outperform MLPs for piecewise polynomial functions with large numbers of discontinuities.	
 Functional inequalities for perturbed measures with applications to log-concave measures and to some Bayesian problems.	, 	patrick.cattiaux@math.univ-toulouse.fr	"Patrick CATTIAUX,Institut de Math√©matiques de Toulouse. CNRS UMR 5219.Universit√© Paul Sabatier,118 route
de Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse cedex 09."	We study functional inequalities (Poincar√©, Cheeger, log-Sobolev) for probability measures obtained as perturbations. Several explicit results for general measures as well as log-concave distributions are given. The initial goal of this work was to obtain explicit bounds on the constants in view of statistical applications for instance. These results are then applied to the Langevin Monte-Carlo method used in statistics in order to compute Bayesian estimators.	
 Vortex collapses for the Euler and Quasi-Geostrophic Models	Ludovic GodardCadillac	None	None	This article studies point-vortex models for the Euler and surface quasi-geostrophic equations. In the case of an inviscid fluid with planar motion, the point-vortex model gives account of dynamics where the vorticity profile is sharply concentrated around some points and approximated by Dirac masses. This article contains two main theorems and also smaller propositions with several links between each other. The first main result focuses on the Euler point-vortex model, and under the non-neutral cluster hypothesis we prove a convergence result. The second result is devoted to the generalization of a classical result by Marchioro and Pulvirenti concerning the improbability of collapses and the extension of this result to the quasi-geostrophic case.	
 Alaska: A Flexible Benchmark for Data Integration Tasks	Valter Crescenzi, Andrea De Angelis, Donatella Firmani, Maurizio Mazzei, Paolo Merialdo, Federico Piai, Divesh Srivastava	None	None	Data integration is a long-standing interest of the data management community and has many disparate applications, including business, science and government. We have recently witnessed impressive results in specific data integration tasks, such as Entity Resolution, thanks to the increasing availability of benchmarks. A limitation of such benchmarks is that they typically come with their own task definition and it can be difficult to leverage them for complex integration pipelines. As a result, evaluating end-to-end pipelines for the entire data integration process is still an elusive goal. In this work, we present Alaska, the first benchmark based on real-world dataset to support seamlessly multiple tasks (and their variants) of the data integration pipeline. The dataset consists of 70k heterogeneous product specifications from 71 e-commerce websites with thousands of different product attributes. Our benchmark comes with profiling meta-data, a set of pre-defined use cases with diverse characteristics, and an extensive manually curated ground truth. We demonstrate the flexibility of our benchmark by focusing on several variants of two crucial data integration tasks, Schema Matching and Entity Resolution . Our experiments show that our benchmark enables the evaluation of a variety of methods that previously were difficult to compare, and can foster the design of more holistic data integration solutions.	
 Modeling opinion leader‚Äôs role in the diffusion of innovation Internship report originally written in June 2018 by intern N. Vodopivec under the supervision of C. Adam and J.-P. Chanteau	Nataa Vodopivec, Carole Adam, JeanPierre Chanteau	None	None	The diffusion of innovations is an important topic for the consumer markets. Early research focused on how innovations spread on the level of the whole society. To get closer to the real world scenarios agent based models (ABM) started focusing on individual-level agents. In our work we will translate an existing ABM that investigates the role of opinion leaders in the process of diffusion of innovations to a new, more expressive platform designed for agent based modeling. We will do it to show that taking advantage of new features of the chosen platform should be encouraged when making models in the field of social sciences in the future, because it can be beneficial for the explanatory power of simulation results.

 Enquire One‚Äôs Parent and Child Before Decision: Fully Exploit Hierarchical Structure for Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion	Suyuchen Wang, Ruihui Zhao, Xi Chen, Yefeng Zheng, Bang Liu	suyuchen.wang@umontreal.ca	None	Taxonomy is a hierarchically structured knowledge graph that plays a crucial role in machine intelligence. The taxonomy expansion task aims to find a position for a new term in an existing taxonomy to capture the emerging knowledge in the world and keep the taxonomy dynamically updated. Previous taxonomy expansion solutions neglect valuable information brought by the hierarchical structure and evaluate the correctness of merely an added edge, which downgrade the problem to node-pair scoring or mini-path classification. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy Expansion Framework ( HEF ), which fully exploits the hierarchical structure‚Äôs properties to maximize the coherence of expanded taxonomy. HEF makes use of taxonomy‚Äôs hierarchical structure in multiple aspects: i) HEF utilizes subtrees containing most relevant nodes as self-supervision data for a complete comparison of parental and sibling relations; ii) HEF adopts a coherence modeling module to evaluate the coherence of a taxonomy‚Äôs subtree by integrating hypernymy relation detection and several tree-exclusive features; iii) HEF introduces the Fitting Score for position selection, which explicitly evaluates both path and level selections and takes full advantage of parental relations to interchange information for disambiguation and self-correction. Extensive experiments show that by better exploiting the hierarchical structure and optimizing taxonomy‚Äôs coherence, HEF vastly surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets by an average improvement of 46.7% in accuracy and 32.3% in mean reciprocal rank.	
 On asymptotic fairness in voting with greedy sampling	Abraham Gutierrez, Sebastian Mller, Stjepan ebek	a.gutierrez@math.tugraz.at	"Abraham Gutierrez,
Institute of Discrete Mathematics
Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"	The basic idea of voting protocols is that nodes query a sample of other nodes and adjust their own opinion throughout several rounds based on the proportion of the sampled opinions. In the classic model, it is assumed that all nodes have the same weight. We study voting protocols for heterogeneous weights with respect to fairness. A voting protocol is fair if the influence on the eventual outcome of a given participant is linear in its weight. Previous work used sampling with replacement to construct a fair voting scheme. However, it was shown that using greedy sampling, i.e., sampling with replacement until a given number of distinct elements is chosen, turns out to be more robust and performant.

The u v ùë¢ ùë£ uv italic_u italic_v -samples along a baseline track are aggregated into a bin until a specified decorrelation tolerance is exceeded. The degree of decorrelation in the bin correspondingly determines the amount of channel and timeslot averaging that is suitable for samples in the bin. This necessarily implies that the number of channels and timeslots varies per bin and the output data loses the rectilinear input shape of the input data.	
 Response to Comment on: Tunneling in DNA with Spin Orbit coupling	Solmar Varela, Iskra Zambrano, Bertrand Berche, Vladimiro Mujica, Ernesto Medina	None	None	The comment in ref.[ WohlmanAharony, ] makes a few points related to the validity of our model, especially in the light of the interpretation of Bardarson‚Äôs theorem: ‚Äúin the presence of time reversal symmetry and for half- integral spin the transmission eigenvalues of the two terminal scattering matrix come in (Kramers) degenerate pairs‚Äù . The authors of ref.[ WohlmanAharony, ] first propose an ansatz for the wave function in the spin active region and go on to show that the resulting transmission does not show spin dependence, reasoning that spin dependence would violate Bardarson‚Äôs assertion. Here we clearly show that the ansatz presented assumes spin-momentum independence from the outset and thus just addresses the spinless particle problem. We then find the appropriate eigenfunction contemplating spin-momentum coupling and show that the resulting spectrum obeys Bardarson‚Äôs theorem. Finally we show that the allowed wavevectors are the ones assumed in the original paper and thus the original conclusions follow. We recognize that the Hamiltonian in our paper written in local coordinates on a helix was deceptively simple and offer the expressions of how it should be written to more overtly convey the physics involved. The relation between spin polarization and torque becomes clear, as described in reference ref.[ VarelaZambrano, ]. This response is a very important clarification in relation to the implications of Bardarson‚Äôs theorem concerning the possibility of spin polarization in one dimensional systems in the linear regime.	
 VisualMRC: Machine Reading Comprehension on Document Images	Ryota Tanaka,Kyosuke Nishida,Sen Yoshida	None	None	Recent studies on machine reading comprehension have focused on text-level understanding but have not yet reached the level of human understanding of the visual layout and content of real-world documents. In this study, we introduce a new visual machine reading comprehension dataset, named VisualMRC, wherein given a question and a document image, a machine reads and comprehends texts in the image to answer the question in natural language. Compared with existing visual question answering (VQA) datasets that contain texts in images, VisualMRC focuses more on developing natural language understanding and generation abilities. It contains 30,000+ pairs of a question and an abstractive answer for 10,000+ document images sourced from multiple domains of webpages. We also introduce a new model that extends existing sequence-to-sequence models, pre-trained with large-scale text corpora, to take into account the visual layout and content of documents. Experiments with VisualMRC show that this model outperformed the base sequence-to-sequence models and a state-of-the-art VQA model. However, its performance is still below that of humans on most automatic evaluation metrics. The dataset will facilitate research aimed at connecting vision and language understanding.	
 Black Hole and Galaxy Coevolution in Moderately Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei at ùëß‚àº1.4 in SXDF	Kenta Setoguchi, Yoshihiro Ueda, Yoshiki Toba, Masayuki Akiyama	None	None	We investigate the relation of black hole mass versus host stellar mass and that of mass accretion rate versus star formation rate (SFR) in moderately luminous ( log ‚Å° L bol ‚àº 44.5 ‚àí 46.5 erg s ‚àí 1 similar-to subscript ùêø bol 44.5 46.5 erg superscript s 1 \log L_{\rm bol}\sim 44.5-46.5\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}} roman_log italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_bol end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àº 44.5 - 46.5 roman_erg roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), X-ray selected broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 1.18 ‚àí 1.68 ùëß 1.18 1.68 z=1.18-1.68 italic_z = 1.18 - 1.68 in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. The far-infrared to far-ultraviolet spectral energy distributions of 85 AGNs are reproduced with the latest version of Code Investigating GALaxy Emission ( CIGALE ), where the AGN clumpy torus model SKIRTOR is implemented. Most of their hosts are confirmed to be main sequence star-forming galaxies. We find that the mean ratio of the black hole mass ( M BH subscript ùëÄ BH M_{\rm BH} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) to the total stellar mass ( M stellar subscript ùëÄ stellar M_{\rm stellar} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stellar end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) is log ‚Å° M BH / M stellar = ‚àí 2.2 subscript ùëÄ BH subscript ùëÄ stellar 2.2 \log M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar}=-2.2 roman_log italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stellar end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - 2.2 , which is similar to the local black hole-to-bulge mass ratio. This suggests that if the host galaxies of these moderately luminous AGNs at z ‚àº 1.4 similar-to ùëß 1.4 z\sim 1.4 italic_z ‚àº 1.4 are dominated by bulges, they already established the local black hole mass-bulge mass relation; if they are disk dominant, their black holes are overmassive relative to the bulges. AGN bolometric luminosities and SFR show a good correlation with ratios higher than that expected from the local black hole-to-bulge mass relation, suggesting that these AGNs are in a SMBH-growth dominant phase.	
 Nucleon-pair coupling scheme in Elliott‚Äôs SU(3) model	Fu, Calvin Johnson, Van Isacker, Zhongzhou Ren	None	None	Elliott‚Äôs SU(3) model is at the basis of the shell-model description of rotational motion in atomic nuclei.

We illustrate the procedure for 6 protons and 6 neutrons in the p f ùëù ùëì pf italic_p italic_f ( s d g ùë† ùëë ùëî sdg italic_s italic_d italic_g ) shell and exactly reproduce the level energies and electric quadrupole properties of the ground-state rotational band with S D G ùëÜ ùê∑ ùê∫ SDG italic_S italic_D italic_G ( S D G I ùëÜ ùê∑ ùê∫ ùêº SDGI italic_S italic_D italic_G italic_I ) pairs. The S D ùëÜ ùê∑ SD italic_S italic_D -pair approximation without significant renormalization, on the other hand, cannot describe the full SU(3) collectivity. A mapping from Elliott‚Äôs fermionic SU(3) model to systems with s ùë† s italic_s , d ùëë d italic_d , g ùëî g italic_g , ‚Ä¶bosons provides insight into the existence of a decoupled collective subspace in terms of S ùëÜ S italic_S , D ùê∑ D italic_D , G ùê∫ G italic_G , ‚Ä¶pairs.	
 ASBSO: An Improved Brain Storm Optimization with Flexible Search Length and Memory-based Selection	Yang Yu, Shangce Gao, , Yirui Wang, Jiujun Cheng and Yuki Todo	None	None	Brain storm optimization (BSO) is a newly proposed population-based optimization algorithm which uses a logarithmic sigmoid transfer function to adjust its search range during the convergent process. However, this adjustment only varies with the current iteration number, and lacks of flexibility and variety which makes a poor search efficiency and robustness of BSO. To alleviate this problem, an adaptive step length structure together with a success memory selection strategy are proposed to be incorporated into BSO. This proposed method, adaptive step length based on memory selection BSO, namely ASBSO, applies multiple step lengths to modify the generation process of new solutions, thus supplying a flexible search according to corresponding problems and convergent periods. The novel memory mechanism which is capable of evaluating and storing the degree of improvements of solutions is used to determine the selection possibility of step lengths. A set of 57 benchmark functions are used to test ASBSO‚Äôs search ability, and four real-world problems are adopted to show its application value. All these test results indicate the remarkable improvement in solution quality, scalability and robustness of ASBSO.	
 Validation of a fast and accurate magnetic tracker operating in the environmental field	Valerio Biancalana, Roberto Cecchi, Piero Chessa, Marco Mandal, Giuseppe Bevilacqua, Yordanka Dancheva, Antonio Vigilante	valerio.biancalana@unisi.it	None	We characterize the performance of a system based on a magnetoresistor array. This instrument is developed to map the magnetic field, and to track a dipolar magnetic source in the presence of a static homogeneous field. The position and orientation of the magnetic source with respect to the sensor frame is retrieved together with the orientation of the frame with respect to the environmental field. A nonlinear best-fit procedure is used, and its precision, time performance, and reliability are analyzed. This analysis is performed in view of the practical application for which the system is designed that is an eye-tracking diagnostics and rehabilitative tool for medical purposes, which require high speed ( ‚â• 100 absent 100 \geq 100 ‚â• 100 Sa/s) and sub-millimetric spatial resolution. A throughout investigation on the results makes it possible to list several observations, suggestions, and hints, which will be useful in the design of similar setups.	
 Cooperative success in epithelial public goods games	Jessie Renton Karen MPageDepartment of Mathematics, University College London,Gower Street, London WCE BT, UK	None	None	Cancer cells obtain mutations which rely on the production of diffusible growth factors to confer a fitness benefit. These mutations can be considered cooperative, and studied as public goods games within the framework of evolutionary game theory. The population structure, benefit function and update rule all influence the evolutionary success of cooperators. We model the evolution of cooperation in epithelial cells using the Voronoi tessellation model. Unlike traditional evolutionary graph theory, this allows us to implement global updating, for which birth and death events are spatially decoupled. We compare, for a sigmoid benefit function, the conditions for cooperation to be favoured and/or beneficial for well-mixed and structured populations. We find that when population structure is combined with global updating, cooperation is more successful than if there were local updating or the population were well-mixed. Interestingly, the qualitative behaviour for the well-mixed population and the Voronoi tessellation model is remarkably similar, but the latter case requires significantly lower incentives to ensure cooperation.	
 ‚ÄùCan I Touch This?‚Äù: Survey of Virtual Reality Interactions via Haptic Solutions	Elodie Bouzbib, Gilles Bailly, Sinan Haliyo, Pascal Frey	None	None	Haptic feedback has become crucial to enhance the user experiences in Virtual Reality (VR). This justifies the sudden burst of novel haptic solutions proposed these past years in the HCI community. This article is a survey of Virtual Reality interactions, relying on haptic devices. We propose two dimensions to describe and compare the current haptic solutions: their degree of physicality, as well as their degree of actuation. We depict a compromise between the user and the designer, highlighting how the range of required or proposed stimulation in VR is opposed to the haptic interfaces flexibility and their deployment in real-life use-cases. This paper (1) outlines the variety of haptic solutions and provides a novel perspective for analysing their associated interactions, (2) highlights the limits of the current evaluation criteria regarding these interactions, and finally (3) reflects the interaction, operation and conception potentials of ‚Äùencountered-type of haptic devices‚Äù.	
 Dynamical density functional theory for the drying and stratification of binary colloidal dispersions	Boshen He, Ignacio MartinFabiani, Roland Roth, Gyula Tth, Andrew Archer	None	None	We develop a dynamical density functional theory based model for the drying of colloidal films on planar surfaces. We consider mixtures of two different sizes of hard-sphere colloids. Depending on the solvent evaporation rate and the initial concentrations of the two species, we observe varying degrees of stratification in the final dried films. Our model predicts the various structures described in the literature previously from experiments and computer simulations, in particular the small-on-top stratified films. Our model also includes the influence of adsorption of particles to the interfaces.	
 Nodeless superconductivity in the charge density wave superconductor LaPt‚ÇÇSi‚ÇÇ	Nie, Yin, AThamizhavel, Wang, Shen, Che, Du, Hossain, Smidman, Lu, Yuan	None	None	We have studied the superconducting gap structure of LaPt 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Si 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT by measuring the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth shift Œî Œª ( T ) Œî ùúÜ ùëá \Delta\lambda(T) roman_Œî italic_Œª ( italic_T ) and point contact spectroscopy of single crystals. Œî Œª ( T ) Œî ùúÜ ùëá \Delta\lambda(T) roman_Œî italic_Œª ( italic_T ) shows an exponential temperature dependence at low temperatures, and the derived normalized superfluid density œÅ s ( T ) subscript ùúå ùë† ùëá \rho_{s}(T) italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_T ) can be well described by a single-gap s -wave model. The point-contact conductance spectra can also be well fitted by an s -wave Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, where the gap value shows a typical BCS temperature and magnetic field dependence consistent with type-II superconductivity. These results suggest fully gapped superconductivity in LaPt 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Si 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling.	
 Singular extremals in ùêø¬π-optimal control problems: sufficient optimality conditions	Francesca Chittaro, Laura Poggiolini	None	Universit√© de Toulon, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LIS, Marseille, France	In this paper we are concerned with generalised L 1 superscript ùêø 1 L^{1} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -minimisation problems, i.e. Bolza problems involving the absolute value of the control with a control-affine dynamics. We establish sufficient conditions for the strong local optimality of extremals given by the concatenation of bang, singular and inactive (zero) arcs. The sufficiency of such conditions is proved by means of Hamiltonian methods. As a by-product of the result, we provide an explicit invariant formula for the second variation along the singular arc.	
 Deep Learning for Instance Retrieval: A Survey	Wei Chen,Yu Liu,Weiping Wang,Erwin Bakker,Theodoros Georgiou,Paul Fieguth,Li Liu,and Michael Lew	None	None	In recent years a vast amount of visual content has been generated and shared from many fields, such as social media platforms, medical imaging, and robotics. This abundance of content creation and sharing has introduced new challenges, particularly that of searching databases for similar content ‚Äî Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) ‚Äî a long-established research area in which improved efficiency and accuracy are needed for real-time retrieval. Artificial intelligence has made progress in CBIR and has significantly facilitated the process of instance search. In this survey we review recent instance retrieval works that are developed based on deep learning algorithms and techniques, with the survey organized by deep feature extraction, feature embedding and aggregation methods, and network fine-tuning strategies. Our survey considers a wide variety of recent methods, whereby we identify milestone work, reveal connections among various methods and present the commonly used benchmarks, evaluation results, common challenges, and propose promising future directions.	
 Sending or not sending twin-field quantum key distribution with distinguishable decoy states	YiFei Lu, MuSheng Jiang, Yang Wang, XiaoXu Zhang, Fan Liu, Chun Zhou, HongWei Li, WanSu Bao	None	None	Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) and its variants can overcome the fundamental rate-distance limit of QKD which has been demonstrated in the laboratory and field while their physical implementations with side channels remains to be further researched. We find the external modulation of different intensity states through the test, required in those TF-QKD with post-phase compensation, shows a side channel in frequency domain. Based on this, we propose a complete and undetected eavesdropping attack, named passive frequency shift attack, on sending or not-sending (SNS) TF-QKD protocol given any difference between signal and decoy states in frequency domain which can be extended to other imperfections with distinguishable decoy states. We analyze this attack by giving the formula of upper bound of real secure key rate and comparing it with lower bound of secret key rate under Alice and Bob‚Äôs estimation with the consideration of actively odd-parity pairing (AOPP) method and finite key effects. The simulation results show that Eve can get full information about the secret key bits without being detected at long distance. Our results emphasize the importance of practical security at source and might provide a valuable reference for the practical implementation of TF-QKD.

We seek to generalize and enrich the anticentre to the context of supersymmetric pairs ( ùî§ , ùî® ) ùî§ ùî® (\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k}) ( fraktur_g , fraktur_k ) , or more generally supersymmetric spaces G / K ùê∫ ùêæ G/K italic_G / italic_K . We define certain invariant distributions on G / K ùê∫ ùêæ G/K italic_G / italic_K , which we call ghost distributions, and which in some sense are induced from invariant distributions on G 0 / K 0 subscript ùê∫ 0 subscript ùêæ 0 G_{0}/K_{0} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .

 A Note on the Representation Power of GHHs	Zhou LuPrinceton University	None	None	In this note we prove a sharp lower bound on the necessary number of nestings of nested absolute-value functions of generalized hinging hyperplanes (GHH) to represent arbitrary CPWL functions. Previous upper bound states that n + 1 ùëõ 1 n+1 italic_n + 1 nestings is sufficient for GHH to achieve universal representation power, but the corresponding lower bound was unknown. We prove that n ùëõ n italic_n nestings is necessary for universal representation power, which provides an almost tight lower bound. We also show that one-hidden-layer neural networks don‚Äôt have universal approximation power over the whole domain. The analysis is based on a key lemma showing that any finite sum of periodic functions is either non-integrable or the zero function, which might be of independent interest.	
 Language Modelling as a Multi-Task Problem	Lucas WeberDTCL, University Pompeu FabraJaap JumeletILLC, University of AmsterdamElia BruniIKW, University of OsnabrckDieuwke HupkesFacebook AI Research	None	None	In this paper, we propose to study language modelling as a multi-task problem, bringing together three strands of research: multi-task learning, linguistics, and interpretability. Based on hypotheses derived from linguistic theory, we investigate whether language models adhere to learning principles of multi-task learning during training. To showcase the idea, we analyse the generalisation behaviour of language models as they learn the linguistic concept of Negative Polarity Items (NPIs). Our experiments demonstrate that a multi-task setting naturally emerges within the objective of the more general task of language modelling. We argue that this insight is valuable for multi-task learning, linguistics and interpretability research and can lead to exciting new findings in all three domains.	
 Algebraic and geometric structures inside the Birkhoff polytope	Grzegorz RajchelMieldzio, Kamil Korzekwa, Zbigniew Puchaa, Karol yczkowski	None	None	The Birkhoff polytope ‚Ñ¨ d subscript ‚Ñ¨ ùëë {\mathcal{B}}_{d} caligraphic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT consisting of all bistochastic matrices of order d ùëë d italic_d assists researchers from many areas, including combinatorics, statistical physics and quantum information. Its subset ùí∞ d subscript ùí∞ ùëë {\mathcal{U}}_{d} caligraphic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of unistochastic matrices, determined by squared moduli of unitary matrices, is of a particular importance for quantum theory as classical dynamical systems described by unistochastic transition matrices can be quantised. In order to investigate the problem of unistochasticity we introduce the set ‚Ñí d subscript ‚Ñí ùëë {\mathcal{L}}_{d} caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of bracelet matrices that forms a subset of ‚Ñ¨ d subscript ‚Ñ¨ ùëë {\mathcal{B}}_{d} caligraphic_B start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , but a superset of ùí∞ d subscript ùí∞ ùëë {\mathcal{U}}_{d} caligraphic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . We prove that for every dimension d ùëë d italic_d this set contains the set of factorisable bistochastic matrices ‚Ñ± d subscript ‚Ñ± ùëë {\mathcal{F}}_{d} caligraphic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and is closed under matrix multiplication by elements of ‚Ñ± d subscript ‚Ñ± ùëë {\mathcal{F}}_{d} caligraphic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . Moreover, we prove that both ‚Ñí d subscript ‚Ñí ùëë {\mathcal{L}}_{d} caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ‚Ñ± d subscript ‚Ñ± ùëë {\mathcal{F}}_{d} caligraphic_F start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are star-shaped with respect to the flat matrix. We also analyse the set of d √ó d ùëë ùëë d\times d italic_d √ó italic_d unistochastic matrices arising from circulant unitary matrices, and show that their spectra lie inside d ùëë d italic_d -hypocycloids on the complex plane.

 Steady-State Model of VSC based FACTS Devices using Flexible Holomorphic Embedding: (SSSC and IPFC)	Pradeep Singh, Nilanjan Senroy	None	"Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi,
30332 INDIA"	For proper planning, operation, control and protection of the power system, the development of suitable steady-state mathematical model of FACTS devices is a key issue. The Fast and Flexible Holomorphic Embedding (FFHE) method converges faster and provides the flexibility to use any state as an initial guess. But to investigate the effect and ability of FACTS devices using FFHE technique, it is necessary to develop an embedded system for these devices. Therefore, this paper presents FFHE-based embedded system for VSC-based FACTS controllers, such as, SSSC and IPFC. The embedded system is also proposed for their controlling modes.

 Which Nilpotent Groups are Self-Similar? 11footnote 1Research supported by CNRS-UMR 5028 and Labex MILYON/ANR-10-LABX-0070.

 Distributed Learning over Markovian Fading Channels for Stable Spectrum Access	Tomer Gafni and Kobi Cohen	None	None	We consider the problem of multi-user spectrum access in wireless networks. The bandwidth is divided into K ùêæ K italic_K orthogonal channels, and M ùëÄ M italic_M users aim to access the spectrum. Each user chooses a single channel for transmission at each time slot. The state of each channel is modeled by a restless unknown Markovian process. Previous studies have analyzed a special case of this setting, in which each channel yields the same expected rate for all users. By contrast, we consider a more general and practical model, where each channel yields a different expected rate for each user. This model adds a significant challenge of how to efficiently learn a channel allocation in a distributed manner to yield a global system-wide objective. We adopt the stable matching utility as the system objective, which is known to yield strong performance in multichannel wireless networks, and develop a novel Distributed Stable Strategy Learning (DSSL) algorithm to achieve the objective. We prove theoretically that DSSL converges to the stable matching allocation, and the regret, defined as the loss in total rate with respect to the stable matching solution, has a logarithmic order with time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the strong performance of the DSSL algorithm.

 Improved algorithms for non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives	Thach VBui,MahdiCheraghchi,An THNguyen,andThuc DNguyen	None	None	The goal of group testing is to efficiently identify a few specific items, called positives, in a large population of items via tests. A test is an action on a subset of items which returns positive if the subset contains at least one positive and negative otherwise. In non-adaptive group testing, all tests are fixed in advance and can be performed in parallel. In this work, we consider non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives in which the items are linearly ordered and the positives are consecutive in that order.	
 Local turnpike analysis using local dissipativity for discrete time discounted optimal control	Lars Grne and Lisa Krgel	None	None	Recent results in the literature have provided connections between the so-called turnpike property, near optimality of closed-loop solutions, and strict dissipativity. Motivated by applications in economics, optimal control problems with discounted stage cost are of great interest. In contrast to non-discounted optimal control problems, it is more likely that several asymptotically stable optimal equilibria coexist. Due to the discounting and transition cost from a local to the global equilibrium, it may be more favourable staying in a local equilibrium than moving to the global ‚Äì cheaper ‚Äì equilibrium. In the literature, strict dissipativity was shown to provide criteria for global asymptotic stability of optimal equilibria and turnpike behavior. In this paper, we propose a local notion of discounted strict dissipativity and a local turnpike property, both depending on the discount factor. Using these concepts, we investigate the local behaviour of (near-)optimal trajectories and develop conditions on the discount factor to ensure convergence to a local asymptotically stable optimal equilibrium.

 FedH2L: Federated Learning with Model and Statistical Heterogeneity	Yiying ListartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Wei ZhoustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Huaimin WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Haibo MistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Timothy Hospedales,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTCollege of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, ChinastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSchool of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UKstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSamsung AI Centre, Cambridge	None	None	Federated learning (FL) enables distributed participants to collectively learn a strong global model without sacrificing their individual data privacy. Mainstream FL approaches require each participant to share a common network architecture and further assume that data are are sampled IID across participants. However, in real-world deployments participants may require heterogeneous network architectures; and the data distribution is almost certainly non-uniform. To address these issues we introduce FedH2L, which is agnostic to the model architecture and robust to different data distributions across participants. In contrast to approaches sharing parameters or gradients, FedH2L relies on mutual distillation, exchanging only posteriors on a shared seed set between participants in a decentralized manner. This makes it extremely bandwidth efficient, model agnostic, and crucially produces models capable of performing well on the whole data distribution when learning from heterogeneous silos.

 How to Evaluate a Summarizer: Study Design and Statistical Analysis for Manual Linguistic Quality Evaluation	Julius Steen, Katja MarkertDepartment of Computational LinguisticsHeidelberg University Heidelberg, Germany	None	None	Manual evaluation is essential to judge progress on automatic text summarization. However, we conduct a survey on recent summarization system papers that reveals little agreement on how to perform such evaluation studies. We conduct two evaluation experiments on two aspects of summaries‚Äô linguistic quality (coherence and repetitiveness) to compare Likert-type and ranking annotations and show that best choice of evaluation method can vary from one aspect to another. In our survey, we also find that study parameters such as the overall number of annotators and distribution of annotators to annotation items are often not fully reported and that subsequent statistical analysis ignores grouping factors arising from one annotator judging multiple summaries. Using our evaluation experiments, we show that the total number of annotators can have a strong impact on study power and that current statistical analysis methods can inflate type I error rates up to eight-fold. In addition, we highlight that for the purpose of system comparison the current practice of eliciting multiple judgements per summary leads to less powerful and reliable annotations given a fixed study budget.	
 Edge-Labeling based Directed Gated Graph Network for Few-shot Learning			None	Existing graph-network-based few-shot learning methods obtain similarity between nodes through a convolution neural network (CNN). However, the CNN is designed for image data with spatial information rather than vector form node feature. In this paper, we proposed an edge-labeling-based directed gated graph network (DGGN) for few-shot learning, which utilizes gated recurrent units to implicitly update the similarity between nodes. DGGN is composed of a gated node aggregation module and an improved gated recurrent unit (GRU) based edge update module. Specifically, the node update module adopts a gate mechanism using activation of edge feature, making a learnable node aggregation process. Besides, improved GRU cells are employed in the edge update procedure to compute the similarity between nodes. Further, this mechanism is beneficial to gradient backpropagation through the GRU sequence across layers. Experiment results conducted on two benchmark datasets show that our DGGN achieves a comparable performance to the-state-of-art methods.	
 Dense Suspension Flow in a Penny-Shaped Crack Part I : Theory	George Wyatt Herbert Huppert	None	1Emmanuel College, St. Andrew‚Äôs Street, Cambridge, CB2 3AP. grw44@cam.ac.uk2King‚Äôs College, King‚Äôs Parade, Cambridge, CB2 1ST. heh1@cam.ac.uk	We study the dynamics of proppants carried by fluid driven into an evolving penny-shaped fracture. The behaviour of the slurry flow is investigated in two phases: pressurised injection and elastic closure. During injection the slurry is modelled using a frictional rheology that takes into account the shear-induced migration and jamming of the proppants. Making pragmatic assumptions of negligible toughness and cross-fracture fluid slip, we find self-similar solutions supporting a range of proppant concentration profiles. In particular, we define an effective viscosity, which equates the fracture evolution of a slurry flow with a given proppant volume fraction, to a Newtonian flow with a particular viscosity. Using this framework, we are able to make predictions about the geometry of the growing fracture and the significance of tip screen-out. In the closure phase, proppants are modelled as incompressible and radially immobile within the narrowing fracture. The effects of proppant concentration on the geometry of the residual propped fracture are explored in full. The results have important applications to industrial fracking and geological dike formation by hot, intruding magma.

In this work, we propose a meta-learning approach to document classification in a limited-resource setting and demonstrate its effectiveness in two different settings: few-shot, cross-lingual adaptation to previously unseen languages; and multilingual joint training when limited target-language data is available during training. We conduct a systematic comparison of several meta-learning methods, investigate multiple settings in terms of data availability and show that meta-learning thrives in settings with a heterogeneous task distribution. We propose a simple, yet effective adjustment to existing meta-learning methods which allows for better and more stable learning, and set a new state of the art on several languages while performing on-par on others, using only a small amount of labeled data.	
 Systematic Evaluation and Usability Analysis of Formal Tools for Railway System Design	AlessioFerrari, FrancoMazzanti, DavideBasile, andMauriceHterBeek	None	None	Formal methods and supporting tools have a long record of successes in the development of safety-critical systems. However, no single tool has emerged as the dominant solution for system design. Each tool differs from the others in terms of the modeling language used, its verification capabilities and other complementary features, and each development context has peculiar needs that require different tools. This is particularly problematic for the railway industry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no actual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in the selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts, a clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is required.	
 Compactness within the space of complete, constant ùëÑ-curvature metrics on the sphere with isolated singularities	Joo HenriqueAndrade, Joo Marcos do, Jesse Ratzkin	None	"Institute of Mathematics and Statistics,

Federal University of Para√≠ba58051-900, Jo√£o Pessoa-PB, Brazil"	In this paper we consider the moduli space of complete, conformally flat metrics on a sphere with k ùëò k italic_k punctures having constant positive Q ùëÑ Q italic_Q -curvature and positive scalar curvature. Previous work has shown that such metrics admit an asymptotic expansion near each puncture, allowing one to define an asymptotic necksize of each singular point. We prove that any set in the moduli space such that the distances between distinct punctures and the asymptotic necksizes all remain bounded away from zero is sequentially compact, mirroring a theorem of D. Pollack about singular Yamabe metrics. Along the way we define a radial Pohozaev invariant at each puncture and refine some a priori bounds of the conformal factor, which may be of independent interest.

 Learnable Non-linear Wavelet Transformation via Normalizing Flow	ShuoHui Li	None	None	Wavelet transformation stands as a cornerstone in modern data analysis and signal processing. Its mathematical essence is an invertible transformation that discerns slow patterns from fast ones in the frequency domain. Such an invertible transformation can be learned by a designed normalizing flow model. With a generalized lifting scheme as coupling layers, a factor-out layer resembling the downsampling, and parameter sharing at different levels of the model, one can train the normalizing flow to filter high-frequency elements at different levels, thus extending traditional linear wavelet transformations to learnable non-linear deep learning models. In this paper, a way of building such flow is proposed, along with a numerical analysis of the learned transformation. Then, we demonstrate the model‚Äôs ability in image lossless compression, show it can achieve SOTA compression scores while achieving a small model size, substantial generalization ability, and the ability to handle high-dimensional data.	
 Measuring the ratio of the gas and dust emission radii of protoplanetary disks in the Lupus star-forming region	Sanchis, Testi, Natta, Facchini, Manara, Miotello, Ercolano, Th Henning, Preibisch, Carpenter, de GregorioMonsalvo, Jayawardhana, Lopez, Mui, Pascucci, SantamaraMiranda, van Terwisga, Williams	None	None	We perform a comprehensive demographic study of the CO extent relative to dust of the disk population in the Lupus clouds, in order to find indications of dust evolution and possible correlations with other disk properties. We increase up to 42 the number of disks of the region with measured R CO subscript ùëÖ CO R_{\mathrm{CO}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and R dust subscript ùëÖ dust R_{\mathrm{dust}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_dust end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), based on the gas emission in the \ce C 12 O \ce superscript ùê∂ 12 ùëÇ \ce{{}^{12}CO} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_C italic_O J = 2 ‚àí 1 ùêΩ 2 1 J=2-1 italic_J = 2 - 1 rotational transition and large dust grains emission at ‚àº 0.89 similar-to absent 0.89 \sim 0.89 ‚àº 0.89 mm. The CO integrated emission map is modeled with an elliptical Gaussian or Nuker function, depending on the quantified residuals; the continuum is fitted to a Nuker profile from interferometric modeling. The CO and dust sizes, namely, the radii enclosing a certain fraction of the respective total flux (e.g., R 68 % subscript ùëÖ percent 68 R_{68\%} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 68 % end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) are inferred from the modeling. The CO emission is more extended than the dust continuum, with a R 68 % CO superscript subscript ùëÖ percent 68 CO R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{CO}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 68 % end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / R 68 % dust superscript subscript ùëÖ percent 68 dust R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{dust}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 68 % end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_dust end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT median value of 2.5, for the entire population and for a sub-sample with high completeness. 6 disks, around 15 % percent 15 15\% 15 % of the Lupus disk population have a size ratio above 4. Based on thermo-chemical modeling, this value can only be explained if the disk has undergone grain growth and radial drift. These disks do not have unusual properties, spreading across the disk population‚Äôs ranges of stellar mass ( M ‚ãÜ subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ M_{\star} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), disk mass ( M disk subscript ùëÄ disk M_{\mathrm{disk}} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), CO and dust sizes ( R CO subscript ùëÖ CO R_{\mathrm{CO}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , R dust subscript ùëÖ dust R_{\mathrm{dust}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_dust end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), and mass accretion of the entire population. We search for correlations between the size ratio and M ‚ãÜ subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ M_{\star} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , M disk subscript ùëÄ disk M_{\mathrm{disk}} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_disk end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , R CO subscript ùëÖ CO R_{\mathrm{CO}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and R dust subscript ùëÖ dust R_{\mathrm{dust}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_dust end_POSTSUBSCRIPT : only a weak monotonic anti-correlation with the R dust subscript ùëÖ dust R_{\mathrm{dust}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_dust end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is found, this would imply that dust evolution is more prominent in more compact dusty disks. The lack of strong correlations is remarkable: the sample covers a wide range of stellar and disk properties, and the majority of the disks have very similar size ratios. This result suggests that the bulk of the disk population may have a similar behavior and evolutionary stage, independent of the stellar and disk properties. These results should be further investigated, since the optical depth difference between CO and dust continuum might play a major role in the observed size ratios of the population. Lastly, we find a monotonic correlation between the CO flux and the CO size. The results for the majority of the disks are consistent with optically thick emission and an average CO temperature of around 30 K, however, the exact value of the temperature is difficult to constrain.	
 Sharpness of the Phase Transition for the orthant model	Thomas Beekenkamp	Thomas.Beekenkamp@math.lmu.de	Mathematisches Institut, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Theresienstra√üe 39, 80333 M√ºnchen, Germany	The orthant model is a directed percolation model on ‚Ñ§ d superscript ‚Ñ§ ùëë \mathbb{Z}^{d} blackboard_Z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , in which all clusters are infinite. We prove a sharp threshold result for this model: if p ùëù p italic_p is larger than the critical value above which the cluster of 0 0 is contained in a cone, then the shift from 0 0 that is required to contain the cluster of 0 0 in that cone is exponentially small. As a consequence, above this critical threshold, a shape theorem holds for the cluster of 0 0 , as well as ballisiticity of the random walk on this cluster.	
 Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantics-Aware Grant-Free Radio Access in IoT Fog Networks	Johannes Dommel, Zoran Utkovski, Osvaldo Simeone and Sawomir Staczak	None	None	A fog-radio access network ( F-RAN ) architecture is studied for an Internet-of-Things ( IoT ) system in which wireless sensors monitor a number of multi-valued events and transmit in the uplink using grant-free random access to multiple edge nodes . Each EN is connected to a central processor ( CP ) via a finite-capacity fronthaul link. In contrast to conventional information-agnostic protocols based on separate source-channel ( SSC ) coding, where each device uses a separate codebook, this paper considers an information-centric approach based on joint source-channel ( JSC ) coding via a non-orthogonal generalization of type-based multiple access ( TBMA ). By leveraging the semantics of the observed signals, all sensors measuring the same event share the same codebook (with non-orthogonal codewords), and all such sensors making the same local estimate of the event transmit the same codeword. The F-RAN architecture directly detects the events‚Äô values without first performing individual decoding for each device. Cloud and edge detection schemes based on Bayesian message passing are designed and trade-offs between cloud and edge processing are assessed.	
 Adversarial Stylometry in the Wild: Transferable Lexical Substitution Attacks on Author Profiling	Chris EmmeryCSAI, Tilburg UniversityCLiPS, University of Antwerpkos KdrBorealis AIGrzegorz ChrupaaCSAI, Tilburg University	None	None	Written language contains stylistic cues that can be exploited to automatically infer a variety of potentially sensitive author information. Adversarial stylometry intends to attack such models by rewriting an author‚Äôs text. Our research proposes several components to facilitate deployment of these adversarial attacks in the wild, where neither data nor target models are accessible. We introduce a transformer-based extension of a lexical replacement attack, and show it achieves high transferability when trained on a weakly labeled corpus‚Äîdecreasing target model performance below chance. While not completely inconspicuous, our more successful attacks also prove notably less detectable by humans. Our framework therefore provides a promising direction for future privacy-preserving adversarial attacks.	
 Doppler Estimation for High‚ÄìVelocity Targets Using Subpulse Processing and the Classic Chinese Remainder Theorem	Fernando Daro Almeida Garca, Andr Saito Guerreiro, Gustavo Rodrigues de Lima Tejerina,Jos Cndido Santos Filho, GustavoFraidenraich, and Michel Daoud Yacoub	None	None	In pulsed Doppler radars, the classic Chinese remainder theorem (CCRT) is a common method to resolve Doppler ambiguities caused by fast-moving targets. Another issue concerning high-velocity targets is related to the loss in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after performing range compression . In particular, this loss can be partially mitigated by the use of subpulse processing (SP). Modern radars combine these techniques in order to reliably unfold the target velocity. However, the presence of background noise may compromise the Doppler estimates. Hence, a rigorous statistical analysis is imperative. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis on Doppler estimation. In particular, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the probability of detection (PD) and probability of false alarm (PFA). To this end, we consider the newly introduce SP along with the CCRT. A comparison analysis between SP and the classic pulse processing (PP) technique is also carried out. Numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulations corroborate the validity of our expressions and show that the SP‚Äìplus‚ÄìCCRT technique helps to greatly reduce the PFA compared to previous studies, thereby improving radar detection.	
 Stability of Linear Systems under Extended Weakly-Hard Constraints	Nils Vreman, Paolo Pazzaglia, Victor Magron, Jie Wang, Martina MaggioSenior Member, IEEE	None	None	Control systems can show robustness to many events, like disturbances and model inaccuracies. It is natural to speculate that they are also robust to sporadic deadline misses when implemented as digital tasks on an embedded platform. This paper proposes a comprehensive stability analysis for control systems subject to deadline misses, leveraging a new formulation to describe the patterns experienced by the control task under different handling strategies. Such analysis brings the assessment of control systems robustness to computational problems one step closer to the controller implementation.

 Tracing young star-forming clumps in the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 7793 with UVIT imaging	Chayan Mondal, Annapurni Subramaniam, Koshy George, Joseph Postma, Smitha Subramanian, Sudhanshu Barway	chayan@iiap.res.in, mondalchayan1991@gmail.com	None	Star formation in galaxies is a hierarchical process with a wide range of scales from smaller clusters to larger stellar complexes. Here, we present an ultra-violet imaging study of the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 7793, observed with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). We find that the disk scale-length estimated in Far-UV (2.64 ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 0.16 kpc) is larger than that in Near-UV (2.21 ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 0.21 kpc) and optical (1.08 kpc), which supports the inside-out growth scenario of the galaxy disk. The star-forming UV disk is also found to be contained within the extent of H I gas of column density greater than 10 21 superscript 10 21 10^{21} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 21 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm ‚àí 2 2 {}^{-2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT . With the spatial resolution of UVIT (1 pixel ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 6.8 pc), we identified 2046 young star-forming clumps in the galaxy with radii between ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 12 - 70 pc, which matches well with the size of GMCs detected in the galaxy. Around 61% of the regions identified in our study have age younger than 20 Myr, which points to a recent enhancement of star formation across the galaxy. We also noticed that the youngest star-forming regions, with age < < < 10 Myr, distinctly trace the flocculent arms of the galaxy. The estimated mass of the clumps cover a range between 10 3 ‚àí 10 6 M ‚äô superscript 10 3 superscript 10 6 subscript ùëÄ direct-product 10^{3}-10^{6}M_{\odot} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . We noticed a gradient in the mass distribution of identified clumps along the spiral arms. We have also studied the nuclear star cluster of the galaxy and found that the stellar populations in the cluster outskirts are younger than the inner part.	
 Towards a Standard Feature Set for Network Intrusion Detection System Datasets	Mohanad Sarhan, Siamak Layeghy, Marius Portmann	None	None	Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are important tools for the protection of computer networks against increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks. Recently, a lot of research effort has been dedicated to the development of Machine Learning (ML) based NIDSs. As in any ML-based application, the availability of high-quality datasets is critical for the training and evaluation of ML-based NIDS. One of the key problems with the currently available NIDS datasets is the lack of a standard feature set. The use of a unique and proprietary set of features for each of the publicly available datasets makes it virtually impossible to compare the performance of ML-based traffic classifiers on different datasets, and hence to evaluate the ability of these systems to generalise across different network scenarios. To address that limitation, this paper proposes and evaluates standard NIDS feature sets based on the NetFlow network meta-data collection protocol and system. We evaluate and compare two NetFlow-based feature set variants, a version with 12 features, and another one with 43 features. For our evaluation, we converted four widely used NIDS datasets (UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, ToN-IoT, CSE-CIC-IDS2018) into new variants with our proposed NetFlow based feature sets. Based on an Extra Tree classifier, we compared the classification performance of the NetFlow-based feature sets with the proprietary feature sets provided with the original datasets. While the smaller feature set cannot match the classification performance of the proprietary feature sets, the larger set with 43 NetFlow features, surprisingly achieves a consistently higher classification performance compared to the original feature set, which was tailored to each of the considered NIDS datasets. The proposed NetFlow-based standard NIDS feature set, together with four benchmark datasets, made available to the research community, allow a fair comparison of ML-based network traffic classifiers across different NIDS datasets. We believe that having a standard feature set is critical for allowing a more rigorous and thorough evaluation of ML-based NIDSs and that it can help bridge the gap between academic research and the practical deployment of such systems.

 Rate Splitting Multiple Access for Multi-Antenna Multi-Carrier Joint Communications and Jamming This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the UK (EPSRC) Grant number EP/S026657/1, and the UK MOD University Defence Research Collaboration (UDRC) in Signal Processing.	OnurDizdar andBrunoClerckxDepartment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College LondonEmail odizdar, bclerckximperialacuk	None	None	Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink multi-antenna wireless networks. In this work, we investigate a novel application of RSMA for joint communications and jamming with a Multi-Carrier (MC) waveform in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC). Our aim is to simultaneously communicate with Information Users (IU) and jam Adversarial Users (AU) to disrupt their communications in a setting where all users perform broadband communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We consider the practical setting of imperfect CSI at transmitter (CSIT) for the IUs and statistical CSIT for AUs. The optimal information and jamming precoders are designed to maximize the sum-rate under jamming power constraints on the pilot subcarriers of AUs, a jamming method considered to be among the most destructive methods for MC waveforms under the considered system model. We compare the sum-rate performance of RSMA and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) schemes by numerical results to demonstrate that RSMA achieves a significant sum-rate gain compared to SDMA.

 FSI - Vibrations of immersed cylinders. Simulations with the engineering open-source code TrioCFD. Test cases and experimental comparisons	Domenico Panunzio, Maria Adela Puscas, Romain Lagrange	None	Den-Service d‚ÄôEtudes M√©caniques et Thermiques (SEMT), CEA, Universit√© Paris-Saclay, F-91191, Gif-sur-Yvette, France	In this paper, we assess the capabilities of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method implemented in the open-source code TrioCFD to tackle down two fluid-structure interaction problems involving moving boundaries. To test the code, we first consider the bi-dimensional case of two coaxial cylinders moving in a viscous fluid. We show that the two fluid forces acting on the cylinders are in phase opposition, with amplitude and phase that only depend on the Stokes number, the dimensionless separation distance and the Keulegan-Carpenter number. Throughout a detailed parametric study, we show that the self (resp. cross) added mass and damping coefficients decrease (resp. increase) with the Stokes number and the separation distance. Our numerical results are in perfect agreement with the theoretical predictions of the literature, thereby validating the robustness of the ALE method implemented in TrioCFD. Then, we challenge the code by considering the case of a vibrating cylinder located in the central position of a square tube bundle. In parallel to the numerical investigations, we also present a new experimental setup for the measurement of the added coefficient, using the direct method introduced by Tanaka. The numerical predictions for the self-added coefficients are shown to be in very good agreement with a theoretical estimation used as a reference by engineers. A good agreement with the experimental results is also obtained for moderate and large Stokes numbers, whereas an important deviation due to parasitic frequencies in the experimental setup appears for low Stokes number. Still, this study clearly confirms that the ALE method implemented in TrioCFD is particularly efficient in solving fluid-structure interaction problems. As an open-source code, and given its ease of use and its flexibility, we believe that TrioCFD is thus perfectly adapted to engineers who need simple numerical tools to tackle down complex industrial problems.	
 Universal relations between atomic dipolar relaxation and van der Waals interaction	YuanGang Deng, YiQuan Zou, GaoRen Wang, Qi Liu, Su Yi, Meng Khoon Tey, Li You	None	None	Dipolar relaxation happens when one or both colliding atoms flip their spins exothermically inside a magnetic ( B ùêµ B italic_B ) field. This work reports precise measurements of dipolar relaxation in a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground state 87 87 {}^{87} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 87 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Rb atoms together with in-depth theoretical investigations. Previous perturbative treatments fail to explain our observations except at very small B ùêµ B italic_B -fields. By employing quantum defect theory based on analytic solutions of asymptotic van der Waals interaction ‚àí C 6 / R 6 subscript ùê∂ 6 superscript ùëÖ 6 -C_{6}/R^{6} - italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( R ùëÖ R italic_R being interatomic spacing), we significantly expand the applicable range of perturbative treatment. We find the B ùêµ B italic_B -dependent dipolar relaxation lineshapes are largely universal, determined by the coefficient C 6 subscript ùê∂ 6 C_{6} italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the associated s ùë† s italic_s -wave scattering lengths a sc subscript ùëé sc a_{\rm sc} italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_sc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of the states before and after spin flips. This universality, which applies generally to other atomic species as well, implicates potential controls of dipolar relaxation and related cold chemical reactions by tuning a sc subscript ùëé sc a_{\rm sc} italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_sc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .	
 Minimum energy with infinite horizon: from stationary to non-stationary states	Acquistapace, FGozzi	None	None	We study a non standard infinite horizon, infinite dimensional linear-quadratic control problem arising in the physics of non-stationary states (see e.g. [ 7 , 9 ] ): finding the minimum energy to drive a given stationary state x ¬Ø = 0 ¬Ø ùë• 0 \bar{x}=0 over¬Ø start_ARG italic_x end_ARG = 0 (at time t = ‚àí ‚àû ùë° t=-\infty italic_t = - ‚àû ) into an arbitrary non-stationary state x ùë• x italic_x (at time t = 0 ùë° 0 t=0 italic_t = 0 ). This is the opposite to what is commonly studied in the literature on null controllability (where one drives a generic state x ùë• x italic_x into the equilibrium state x ¬Ø = 0 ¬Ø ùë• 0 \bar{x}=0 over¬Ø start_ARG italic_x end_ARG = 0 ). Consequently, the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) associated to this problem is non-standard since the sign of the linear part is opposite to the usual one and since it is intrinsically unbounded. Hence the standard theory of AREs does not apply. The analogous finite horizon problem has been studied in the companion paper [ 1 ] . Here, similarly to such paper, we prove that the linear selfadjoint operator associated to the value function is a solution of the above mentioned ARE. Moreover, differently to [ 1 ] , we prove that such solution is the maximal one. The first main result (Theorem 4.7 ) is proved by approximating the problem with suitable auxiliary finite horizon problems (which are different from the one studied in [ 1 ] ). Finally in the special case where the involved operators commute we characterize all solutions of the ARE (Theorem 5.5 ) and we apply this to the Landau-Ginzburg model.	
 Echo State Network for two-dimensional turbulent moist Rayleigh-B√©nard convection	Florian Heyder, Jrg Schumacher	None	None	Recurrent neural networks are machine learning algorithms which are suited well to predict time series. Echo state networks are one specific implementation of such neural networks that can describe the evolution of dynamical systems by supervised machine learning without solving the underlying nonlinear mathematical equations. In this work, we apply an echo state network to approximate the evolution of two-dimensional moist Rayleigh-B√©nard convection and the resulting low-order turbulence statistics. We conduct long-term direct numerical simulations in order to obtain training and test data for the algorithm. Both sets are pre-processed by a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) using the snapshot method to reduce the amount of data. Training data comprise long time series of the first 150 most energetic POD coefficients. The reservoir is subsequently fed by these data and predicts of future flow states. The predictions are thoroughly validated by original simulations. Our results show good agreement of the low-order statistics. This incorporates also derived statistical moments such as the cloud cover close to the top of the convection layer and the flux of liquid water across the domain. We conclude that our model is capable of learning complex dynamics which is introduced here by the tight interaction of turbulence with the nonlinear thermodynamics of phase changes between vapor and liquid water. Our work opens new ways for the dynamic parametrization of subgrid-scale transport in larger-scale circulation models.	
 See-Through Captions: Real-Time Captioning on Transparent Display for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing People	Kenta Yamamoto, Ippei Suzuki, Akihisa Shitara, Yoichi Ochiai	None	None	Real-time captioning is a useful technique for deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people to talk to hearing people. With the improvement in device performance and the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR), real-time captioning is becoming an important tool for helping DHH people in their daily lives. To realize higher-quality communication and overcome the limitations of mobile and augmented-reality devices, real-time captioning that can be used comfortably while maintaining nonverbal communication and preventing incorrect recognition is required. Therefore, we propose a real-time captioning system that uses a transparent display.

We characterize these behaviors by analytically computing the position distribution and persistence exponents. The position distribution shows a crossover from a strongly non-diffusive and anisotropic behavior at short-times to a diffusive isotropic behavior via an intermediate regime (II) or (III).

 Recursive Decoding of Reed-Muller Codes Starting With the Higher-Rate Constituent Code	MikhailKamenev	None	None	Recursive list decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, with moderate list size, is known to approach maximum-likelihood (ML) performance of short length ( ‚â§ 256 ) absent 256 (\leq 256) ( ‚â§ 256 ) RM codes. Recursive decoding employs the Plotkin construction to split the original code into two shorter RM codes with different rates. In contrast to the standard approach which decodes the lower-rate code first, the method in this paper decodes the higher-rate code first. This modification enables an efficient permutation-based decoding technique, with permutations being selected on the fly from the automorphism group of the code using soft information from a channel. Simulation results show that the error-rate performance of the proposed algorithms, enhanced by a permutation selection technique, is close to that of the automorphism-based recursive decoding algorithm with similar complexity for short RM codes, while our decoders perform better for longer RM codes. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms achieve near-ML performance for short RM codes and for RM codes of length 2 m superscript 2 ùëö 2^{m} 2 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and order m ‚àí 3 ùëö 3 m-3 italic_m - 3 with reasonable complexity.	
 1 Introduction			None	Leibniz algebras are a non-anticommutative version of Lie algebras. They play an important role in different areas of mathematics and physics and have attracted much attention over the last thirty years. In this paper we investigate whether conditions such as being a Lie algebra, cyclic, simple, semisimple, solvable, supersolvable or nilpotent in such an algebra are preserved by lattice isomorphisms.

In order to rationalize their properties and predict the behaviour of microgel suspensions, it is necessary to develop a coarse-graining strategy that starts from the accurate modelling of single particles. Here, we provide a numerical advancement of a recently-introduced model for charged co-polymerized microgels by improving the treatment of ionic groups in the polymer network. We investigate the thermoresponsive properties of the particles, in particular their swelling behaviour and structure, finding that, when charged groups are considered to be hydrophilic at all temperatures, highly charged microgels do not achieve a fully collapsed state, in favorable comparison to experiments. In addition, we explicitly include the solvent in the description and put forward a mapping between the solvophobic potential in the absence of the solvent and the monomer-solvent interactions in its presence, which is found to work very accurately for any charge fraction of the microgel. Our work paves the way for comparing single-particle properties and swelling behaviour of ionic microgels to experiments and to tackle the study of these charged soft particles at a liquid-liquid interface.	
 OffCon¬≥: What is State-of-the-Art Anyway?	Philip BallDepartment of Engineering ScienceUniversity of OxfordOxford, UK, Stephen RobertsDepartment of Engineering ScienceUniversity of OxfordOxford, UK	None	None	Two popular approaches to model-free continuous control tasks are SAC and TD3. At first glance these approaches seem rather different; SAC aims to solve the entropy-augmented MDP by minimising the KL-divergence between a stochastic proposal policy and a hypotheical energy-basd soft Q-function policy, whereas TD3 is derived from DPG, which uses a deterministic policy to perform policy gradient ascent along the value function. In reality, both approaches are remarkably similar, and belong to a family of approaches we call ‚ÄòOff-Policy Continuous Generalized Policy Iteration‚Äô. This illuminates their similar performance in most continuous control benchmarks, and indeed when hyperparameters are matched, their performance can be statistically indistinguishable. To further remove any difference due to implementation, we provide OffCon 3 3 {}^{3} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ( Off -Policy Con tinuous Con trol: Con solidated), a code base featuring state-of-the-art versions of both algorithms.	
 A phonetic model of non-native spoken word processing	Yevgen MatusevychSchool of InformaticsUniversity of EdinburghHerman KamperEE EngineeringStellenbosch UniversityThomas SchatzDepartment of Linguistics UMIACSUniversity of MarylandNaomi FeldmanDepartment of Linguistics UMIACSUniversity of MarylandSharon GoldwaterSchool of InformaticsUniversity of Edinburgh	None	None	Non-native speakers show difficulties with spoken word processing. Many studies attribute these difficulties to imprecise phonological encoding of words in the lexical memory. We test an alternative hypothesis: that some of these difficulties can arise from the non-native speakers' phonetic perception. We train a computational model of phonetic learning, which has no access to phonology, on either one or two languages. We first show that the model exhibits predictable behaviors on phone-level and word-level discrimination tasks. We then test the model on a spoken word processing task, showing that phonology may not be necessary to explain some of the word processing effects observed in non-native speakers. We run an additional analysis of the model's lexical representation space, showing that the two training languages are not fully separated in that space, similarly to the languages of a bilingual human speaker.

 Defect production due to time-dependent coupling to environment in the Lindblad equation	Balzs Gulcsi, Balzs Dra	gulacsi@phy.bme.hu	None	Recently defect production was investigated during non-unitary dynamics due to non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. By ramping up the non-Hermitian coupling linearly in time through an exceptional point, defects are produced in much the same way as approaching a Hermitian critical point. A generalized Kibble‚ÄìZurek scaling accounted for the ensuing scaling of the defect density in terms of the speed of the drive and the corresponding critical exponents. Here we extend this setting by adding the recycling term and considering the full Lindbladian time evolution of the problem with quantum jumps. We find that by linearly ramping up the environmental coupling in time, and going beyond the steady-state solution of the Liouvillian, the defect density scales linearly with the speed of the drive for all cases. This scaling is unaffected by the presence of exceptional points of the Liouvillian, which can show up in the transient states. By using a variant of the adiabatic perturbation theory, the scaling of the defect density is determined exactly from a set of algebraic equations. Our study indicates the distinct sensitivity of the Lindbladian time evolution to exceptional points corresponding to steady states and transient states.	
 On the Interpretability of Deep Learning Based Models for Knowledge Tracing	Xinyi Ding,Eric Larson	None	None	Knowledge tracing allows Intelligent Tutoring Systems to infer which topics or skills a student has mastered, thus adjusting curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning based models like Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and Dynamic Key-Value Memory Network (DKVMN) have achieved significant improvements compared with models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA). However, these deep learning based models are not as interpretable as other models because the decision-making process learned by deep neural networks is not wholly understood by the research community. In previous work, we critically examined the DKT model, visualizing and analyzing the behaviors of DKT in high dimensional space. In this work, we extend our original analyses with a much larger dataset and add discussions about the memory states of the DKVMN model. We discover that Deep Knowledge Tracing has some critical pitfalls: 1) instead of tracking each skill through time, DKT is more likely to learn an ‚Äòability‚Äô model; 2) the recurrent nature of DKT reinforces irrelevant information that it uses during the tracking task; 3) an untrained recurrent network can achieve similar results to a trained DKT model, supporting a conclusion that recurrence relations are not properly learned and, instead, improvements are simply a benefit of projection into a high dimensional, sparse vector space. Based on these observations, we propose improvements and future directions for conducting knowledge tracing research using deep neural network models.

Yet, the challenge of end-to-end energy efficiency, memory footprint and system complexity of current Neural Network (NN) powered AI-KWS pipelines has remained ever present. This paper evaluates KWS utilizing a learning automata powered machine learning algorithm called the Tsetlin Machine (TM). Through significant reduction in parameter requirements and choosing logic over arithmetic based processing, the TM offers new opportunities for low-power KWS while maintaining high learning efficacy. In this paper we explore a TM based keyword spotting ( KWS ) pipeline to demonstrate low complexity with faster rate of convergence compared to NNs. Further, we investigate the scalability with increasing keywords and explore the potential for enabling low-power on-chip KWS.

 Homogenization of Schr√∂dinger equations. Extended Effective Mass Theorems for non-crystalline matter	Vernny CcajmastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Wladimir NevesstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jean SilvastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	This paper concerns the homogenization of Schr√∂dinger equations for non-crystalline matter, that is to say the coefficients are given by the composition of stationary functions with stochastic deformations. Two rigorous results of so-called effective mass theorems in solid state physics are obtained: a general abstract result (beyond the classical stationary ergodic setting), and one for quasi-perfect materials (i.e. the disorder in the non-crystalline matter is limited). The former relies on the double-scale limits and the wave function is spanned on the Bloch basis. Therefore, we have extended the Bloch Theory which was restrict until now to crystals (periodic setting). The second result relies on the Perturbation Theory and a special case of stochastic deformations, namely stochastic perturbation of the identity.

 Towards Improving the Consistency, Efficiency, and Flexibility of Differentiable Neural Architecture Search	Yibo Yang,, Shan You, Hongyang Li, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, Zhouchen Lin,Center for Data Science, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking UniversityKey Laboratory of Machine Perception MOE, School of EECS, Peking UniversitySenseTimeibo, lhyustb, zlinpkueducn, youshan, wangfei, qianchensensetimecom	None	None	Most differentiable neural architecture search methods construct a super-net for search and derive a target-net as its sub-graph for evaluation. There exists a significant gap between the architectures in search and evaluation. As a result, current methods suffer from an inconsistent, inefficient, and inflexible search process. In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is composed of En gine-cells and Tran sit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable for architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by architecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in search and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much memory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature sharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more efficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation. Besides, it supports the search for topology where a node can be connected to prior nodes with any number of connections, so that the searched architectures could be more flexible. For experiments on CIFAR-10, our search on the standard space requires only 0.06 GPU-day. We further have an error rate of 2.22% with 0.07 GPU-day for the search on an extended space. We can also directly perform the search on ImageNet with topology learnable and achieve a top-1 error rate of 23.8% in 2.1 GPU-day.

 On Massive IoT Connectivity with Temporally-Correlated User Activity	Qipeng Wang, Liang Liu, Shuowen Zhang, and Francis Lauliangeieliu,shuowenzhang,franciscmlaupolyueduhk	None	None	This paper considers joint device activity detection and channel estimation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where a large number of IoT devices exist but merely a random subset of them become active for short-packet transmission at each time slot. In particular, to improve the detection performance, we propose to leverage the temporal correlation in user activity, i.e., a device active at the previous time slot is more likely to be still active at the current time slot. Despite the appealing temporal correlation feature, it is challenging to unveil the connection between the estimated activity pattern for the previous time slot (which may be imperfect) and the true activity pattern at the current time slot due to the unknown estimation error. In this paper, we manage to tackle this challenge under the framework of approximate message passing (AMP). Specifically, thanks to the state evolution, the correlation between the activity pattern estimated by AMP at the previous time slot and the real activity pattern at the previous and current time slot is quantified explicitly. Based on the well-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this useful SI into the design of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoisers and log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test based activity detectors under the AMP framework. Theoretical comparison between the SI-aided AMP algorithm and its counterpart without utilizing temporal correlation is provided. Moreover, numerical results are given which show the significant gain in activity detection accuracy brought by the SI-aided algorithm.	
 Structural Color from Solid-State Polymerization-Induced Phase Separation	Alba Sicher,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Rabea GanzstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Andreas MenzelstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Daniel MessmerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Guido PanzarasastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Maria FeofilovastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Richard PrumstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,, Vinodkumar SaranathanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ren RossistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Eric DufresnestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	rene.rossi@empa.ch, eric.dufresne@mat.ethz.ch	None	Structural colors are produced by wavelength-dependent scattering of light from nanostructures. While living organisms often exploit phase separation to directly assemble structurally colored materials from macromolecules, synthetic structural colors are typically produced in a two-step process involving the sequential synthesis and assembly of building blocks. Phase separation is attractive for its simplicity, but applications are limited due to a lack of robust methods for its control. A central challenge is to arrest phase separation at the desired length scale. Here, we show that solid-state polymerization-induced phase separation can produce stable structures at optical length scales. In this process, a polymeric solid is swollen and softened with a second monomer. During its polymerization, the two polymers become immiscible and phase separate. As free monomer is depleted, the host matrix resolidifies and arrests coarsening. The resulting polymeric composites have a blue or white appearance. We compare these biomimetic nanostructures to those in structurally-colored feather barbs, and demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by producing structural color in filaments and large sheets.	
 New estimations of the added mass and damping of two cylinders vibrating in a viscous fluid, from theoretical and numerical approaches	Romain Lagrange, Yann Fraigneau	romain.lagrange@cea.fr	Den-Service d‚ÄôEtudes M√©caniques et Thermiques (SEMT), CEA, Universit√© Paris-Saclay, F-91191, Gif-sur-Yvette, France	This paper deals with the small oscillations of two circular cylinders immersed in a viscous stagnant fluid. A new theoretical approach based on an Helmholtz expansion and a bipolar coordinate system is presented to estimate the fluid forces acting on the two bodies. We show that these forces are linear combinations of the cylinder accelerations and velocities, through viscous fluid added coefficients. To assess the validity of this theory, we consider the case of two equal size cylinders, one of them being stationary while the other one is forced sinusoidally . The self-added mass and damping coefficients are shown to decrease with both the Stokes number and the separation distance. The cross-added mass and damping coefficients tend to increase with the Stokes number and the separation distance. Compared to the inviscid results, the effect of viscosity is to add a correction term which scales as S k ‚àí 1 / 2 ùëÜ superscript ùëò 1 2 Sk^{-1/2} italic_S italic_k start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . When the separation distance is sufficiently large, the two cylinders behave as if they were independent and the Stokes predictions for an isolated cylinder are recovered. Compared to previous works, the present theory offers a simple and flexible alternative for an easy determination of the fluid forces and related added coefficients. To our knowledge, this is also the first time that a numerical approach based on a penalization method is presented in the context of fluid-structure interactions for relatively small Stokes numbers, and successfully compared to theoretical predictions.	
 Decision Machines: Interpreting Decision Tree as a Model Combination Method	Jinxiong Zhangjinxiongzhangqqcom	None	None	Based on decision trees, it is efficient to handle tabular data. Conventional decision tree growth methods often result in suboptimal trees because of their greedy nature. Their inherent structure limits the options of hardware to implement decision trees in parallel. Here is a compact representation of binary decision trees to overcome these deficiencies. We explicitly formulate the dependence of prediction on binary tests for binary decision trees and construct a function to guide the input sample from the root to the appropriate leaf node. And based on this formulation we introduce a new interpretation of binary decision trees. Then we approximate this formulation via continuous functions. Finally we interpret decision tree as a model combination method. And we propose the selection-prediction scheme to unify a few learning methods.	
 Low-Complexity Joint CFO and Channel Estimation for RIS-aided OFDM Systems	SuminJeong,Arman Farhang,NemanjaStefanPerovi,andMarkFFlanagan	None	None	Accurate channel estimation is essential for achieving the performance gains offered by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communications. A variety of channel estimation methods have been proposed for such systems; however, none of the existing methods takes into account the effect of synchronization errors such as carrier frequency offset (CFO). In general, CFO can significantly degrade the channel estimation performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Motivated by this, we investigate the effect of CFO on channel estimation for RIS-aided OFDM systems. Furthermore, we propose a joint CFO and channel impulse response (CIR) estimation method for these systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and also demonstrate that the use of time-domain rather than frequency-domain estimation in this context results in an improvement in the mean-squared error (MSE) performance of channel estimation as well as in a significantly lower overall computational complexity.	
 Triangular Bidword Generation for Sponsored Search Auction	Zhenqiao Song, Jiaze Chen, Hao Zhou, Lei Li	songzhenqiao,chenjiaze,zhouhao.nlp,lileilab@bytedance.com	None	Sponsored search auction is a crucial component of modern search engines. It requires a set of candidate bidwords that advertisers can place bids on. Existing methods generate bidwords from search queries or advertisement content. However, they suffer from the data noise in ¬°query, bidword¬ø and ¬°advertisement, bidword¬ø pairs. In this paper, we propose a triangular bidword generation model (TRIDENT), which takes the high-quality data of paired ¬°query, advertisement¬ø as a supervision signal to indirectly guide the bidword generation process. Our proposed model is simple yet effective: by using bidword as the bridge between search query and advertisement, the generation of search query, advertisement and bidword can be jointly learned in the triangular training framework. This alleviates the problem that the training data of bidword may be noisy. Experimental results, including automatic and human evaluations, show that our proposed TRIDENT can generate relevant and diverse bidwords for both search queries and advertisements. Our evaluation on online real data validates the effectiveness of the TRIDENT‚Äôs generated bidwords for product search.

 Compositional Semantics for Probabilistic Programs with Exact Conditioning	Dario Stein, Sam Staton	None	None	We define a probabilistic programming language for Gaussian random variables with a first-class exact conditioning construct. We give operational, denotational and equational semantics for this language, establishing convenient properties like exchangeability of conditions. Conditioning on equality of continuous random variables is nontrivial, as the exact observation may have probability zero; this is Borel‚Äôs paradox . Using categorical formulations of conditional probability, we show that the good properties of our language are not particular to Gaussians, but can be derived from universal properties, thus generalizing to wider settings. We define the Cond construction, which internalizes conditioning as a morphism, providing general compositional semantics for probabilistic programming with exact conditioning.

 Combat Data Shift in Few-shot Learning with Knowledge Graph	Yongchun Zhu, Fuzhen Zhuang, Xiangliang Zhang, Zhiyuan Qi, Zhiping Shi, Juan Cao, Qing He	None	Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing 100190, China	Many few-shot learning approaches have been designed under the meta-learning framework, which learns from a variety of learning tasks and generalizes to new tasks. These meta-learning approaches achieve the expected performance in the scenario where all samples are drawn from the same distributions (i.i.d. observations). However, in real-world applications, few-shot learning paradigm often suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the same task, could be drawn from various data distributions. Most existing few-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data shift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts. However, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot learning, due to the limited number of labeled samples in each task. Targeting at addressing this problem, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework to extract task-specific representations and task-shared representations with the help of knowledge graph. The data shift within/between tasks can thus be combated by the combination of task-shared and task-specific representations. The proposed model is evaluated on popular benchmarks and two constructed new challenging datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its remarkable performance.

 Coverage Analysis of Broadcast Networks with Users Having Heterogeneous Content/Advertisement Preferences	Kanchan Chaurasia, Reena Sahu, Abhishek Gupta	None	None	This work is focused on the system-level performance of a broadcast network. Since all transmitters in a broadcast network transmit the identical signal, received signals from multiple transmitters can be combined to improve system performance. We develop a stochastic geometry based analytical framework to derive the coverage of a typical receiver. We show that there may exist an optimal connectivity radius that maximizes the rate coverage. Our analysis includes the fact that users may have their individual content/advertisement preferences. We assume that there are multiple classes of users with each user class prefers a particular type of content/advertisements and the users will pay the network only when then can see content aligned with their interest. The operator may choose to transmit multiple contents simultaneously to cater more users‚Äô interests to increase its revenue. We present revenue models to study the impact of the number of contents on the operator revenue. We consider two scenarios for users‚Äô distribution- one where users‚Äô interest depends on their geographical location and the one where it doesn‚Äôt. With the help of numerical results and analysis, we show the impact of various parameters including content granularity, connectivity radius, and rate threshold and present important design insights.

         3Universit√© de Paris, Institut de physique du globe de Paris, CNRS, IGN, F-75005 Paris, France"	None	Anelastic convection at high Rayleigh number in a plane parallel layer with no slip boundaries is considered. Energy and entropy balance equations are derived, and they are used to develop scaling laws for the heat transport and the Reynolds number. The appearance of an entropy structure consisting of a well-mixed uniform interior, bounded by thin layers with entropy jumps across them, makes it possible to derive explicit forms for these scaling laws. These are given in terms of the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, and the bottom to top temperature ratio, which measures how stratified the layer is. The top and bottom boundary layers are examined and they are found to be very different, unlike in the Boussinesq case. Elucidating the structure of these boundary layers plays a crucial part in determining the scaling laws. Physical arguments governing these boundary layers are presented, concentrating on the case in which the boundary layers are thin even when the stratification is large, the incompressible boundary layer case. Different scaling laws are found, depending on whether the viscous dissipation is primarily in the boundary layers or in the bulk. The cases of both high and low Prandtl number are considered. Numerical simulations of no-slip anelastic convection up to a Rayleigh number of 10 7 superscript 10 7 10^{7} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT have been performed and our theoretical predictions are compared with the numerical results.	
 Detecting discriminatory risk through data annotation based on Bayesian inferences	Elena Beretta, Antonio Vetr, Bruno Lepri, Juan Carlos De Martin	elena.beretta@polito.it	None	Thanks to the increasing growth of computational power and data availability, the research in machine learning has advanced with tremendous rapidity. Nowadays, the majority of automatic decision making systems are based on data. However, it is well known that machine learning systems can present problematic results if they are built on partial or incomplete data. In fact, in recent years several studies have found a convergence of issues related to the ethics and transparency of these systems in the process of data collection and how they are recorded. Although the process of rigorous data collection and analysis is fundamental in the model design, this step is still largely overlooked by the machine learning community. For this reason, we propose a method of data annotation based on Bayesian statistical inference that aims to warn about the risk of discriminatory results of a given data set. In particular, our method aims to deepen knowledge and promote awareness about the sampling practices employed to create the training set, highlighting that the probability of success or failure conditioned to a minority membership is given by the structure of the data available. We empirically test our system on three datasets commonly accessed by the machine learning community and we investigate the risk of racial discrimination.

 An Empirical Study of Cross-Lingual Transferability in Generative Dialogue State Tracker	YenTing Lin,YunNung Chen	None	None	There has been a rapid development in data-driven task-oriented dialogue systems with the benefit of large-scale datasets. However, the progress of dialogue systems in low-resource languages lags far behind due to the lack of high-quality data. To advance the cross-lingual technology in building dialog systems, DSTC9 introduces the task of cross-lingual dialog state tracking, where we test the DST module in a low-resource language given the rich-resource training dataset.

 Marangoni instability of a drop in a stably stratified liquid	Yanshen Li, Christian Diddens, Andrea Prosperetti, Detlef Lohse	yanshen.li@utwente.nl	None	Marangoni instabilities can emerge when a liquid interface is subjected to a concentration or temperature gradient. It is generally believed that for these instabilities bulk effects like buoyancy are negligible as compared to interfacial forces, especially on small scales. Consequently, the effect of a stable stratification on the Marangoni instability has hitherto been ignored. Here we report, for an immiscible drop immersed in a stably stratified ethanol-water mixture, a new type of oscillatory solutal Marangoni instability which is triggered once the stratification has reached a critical value. We experimentally explore the parameter space spanned by the stratification strength and the drop size and theoretically explain the observed crossover from levitating to bouncing by balancing the advection and diffusion around the drop. Finally, the effect of the stable stratification on the Marangoni instability is surprisingly amplified in confined geometries, leading to an earlier onset.	
 KoreALBERT: Pretraining a Lite BERT Model for Korean Language Understanding	Hyunjae Lee, Jaewoong Yoon, Bonggyu Hwang, Seongho Joe, Seungjai Min, Youngjune Gwon	None	None	A Lite BERT (ALBERT) has been introduced to scale up deep bidirectional representation learning for natural languages. Due to the lack of pretrained ALBERT models for Korean language, the best available practice is the multilingual model or resorting back to the any other BERT-based model. In this paper, we develop and pretrain KoreALBERT, a monolingual ALBERT model specifically for Korean language understanding. We introduce a new training objective, namely Word Order Prediction (WOP), and use alongside the existing MLM and SOP criteria to the same architecture and model parameters. Despite having significantly fewer model parameters (thus, quicker to train), our pretrained KoreALBERT outperforms its BERT counterpart on 6 different NLU tasks. Consistent with the empirical results in English by Lan et al., KoreALBERT seems to improve downstream task performance involving multi-sentence encoding for Korean language. The pretrained KoreALBERT is publicly available to encourage research and application development for Korean NLP.	
 Overcoming finite-size effects in electronic structure simulations at extreme conditions	Tobias Dornheim, Jan Vorberger	t.dornheim@hzdr.de	None	Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods in principle allow for the calculation of exact properties of correlated many-electron systems, but are in general limited to the simulation of a finite number of electrons N ùëÅ N italic_N in periodic boundary conditions. Therefore, an accurate theory of finite-size effects is indispensable to bridge the gap to realistic applications in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we revisit the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature as it is relevant to contemporary research e.g. in the field of warm dense matter. In particular, we present a new scheme to eliminate finite-size effects both in the static structure factor S ( q ) ùëÜ ùëû S(q) italic_S ( italic_q ) and in the interaction energy v ùë£ v italic_v , which is based on the density response formalism.

(http://energy.gov/downloads/doe-public-access-plan).	Alexander McCaskey and Thien Nguyen	None	None	We demonstrate the utility of the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) for quantum computing. Specifically, we extend MLIR with a new quantum dialect that enables the expression and compilation of common quantum assembly languages. The true utility of this dialect is in its ability to be lowered to the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) in a manner that is adherent to the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) specification recently proposed by Microsoft. We leverage a qcor -enabled implementation of the QIR quantum runtime API to enable a retargetable (quantum hardware agnostic) compiler workflow mapping quantum languages to hybrid quantum-classical binary executables and object code. We evaluate and demonstrate this novel compiler workflow with quantum programs written in OpenQASM 2.0. We provide concrete examples detailing the generation of MLIR from OpenQASM source files, the lowering process from MLIR to LLVM IR, and ultimately the generation of executable binaries targeting available quantum processors.

In order to artificially control the contribution of photometric error and emission lines to total flux, we develop a PCA-based stochastic mock catalogue generation technique that allows for generating infinite signal-to-noise ratio model spectra with realistic emission lines on top of theoretical stellar continua. Instead of running the computationally expensive stellar population synthesis and nebular emission codes, our algorithm generates realistic spectra with a statistical approach, and ‚Äì as an alternative to attempting to constrain the priors on input model parameters ‚Äì works by matching output observational parameters. Hence, it can be used to match the luminosity, colour, emission line and photometric error distribution of any photometric sample with sufficient flux-calibrated spectroscopic follow-up. We test three simple empirical photometric estimation methods and compare the results with and without photometric noise and strong emission lines. While photometric noise clearly dominates the uncertainty of photometric redshift estimates, the key findings are that emission lines play a significant role in resolving colour space degeneracies and good spectroscopic coverage of the entire colour space is necessary to achieve good results with empirical photo-z methods. Template fitting methods, on the other hand, must use a template set with sufficient variation in emission line strengths and ratios, or even better, first estimate the redshift empirically and fit the colours with templates at the best-fit redshift to calculate the K-correction and various physical parameters.	
 B-spline Parameterized Joint Optimization of Reconstruction and K-space Trajectories (BJORK) for Accelerated 2D MRI	Guanhua Wang, Tianrui Luo, JonFredrik Nielsen, Douglas Noll, Senior Member, IEEE, and Jeffrey FesslerFellow, IEEE	None	None	Optimizing k-space sampling trajectories is a promising yet challenging topic for fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This work proposes to optimize a reconstruction method and sampling trajectories jointly concerning image reconstruction quality in a supervised learning manner. We parameterize trajectories with quadratic B-spline kernels to reduce the number of parameters and apply multi-scale optimization, which may help to avoid sub-optimal local minima. The algorithm includes an efficient non-Cartesian unrolled neural network-based reconstruction and an accurate approximation for backpropagation through the non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) operator to accurately reconstruct and back-propagate multi-coil non-Cartesian data. Penalties on slew rate and gradient amplitude enforce hardware constraints. Sampling and reconstruction are trained jointly using large public datasets. To correct for possible eddy-current effects introduced by the curved trajectory, we use a pencil-beam trajectory mapping technique. In both simulations and in-vivo experiments, the learned trajectory demonstrates significantly improved image quality compared to previous model-based and learning-based trajectory optimization methods for 10 √ó \times √ó acceleration factors. Though trained with neural network-based reconstruction, the proposed trajectory also leads to improved image quality with compressed sensing-based reconstruction.

 Radio detection of VIK J2318-3113, the most distant radio-loud quasar (ùëß=6.44)	Ighina, Belladitta, Caccianiga, Broderick, Drouart, Moretti, Seymour	None	None	We report the 888 MHz radio detection in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) of VIK J2318 ‚àí - - 3113, a z ùëß z italic_z =6.44 quasar.

Moreover, the high bolometric luminosity of the source (L bol bol {}_{\mathrm{{bol}}} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT roman_bol end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT =7.4 √ó 10 46 absent superscript 10 46 \times 10^{46} √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 46 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT erg s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ) suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole with a high mass ( ‚â≥ greater-than-or-equivalent-to \gtrsim ‚â≥ 6 √ó \times √ó 10 8 8 {}^{8} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) at a time when the Universe was younger than a billion years. Combining the new radio data from RACS with previous ASKAP observations at the same frequency, we found that the flux density of the source may have varied by a factor of ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 2, which could suggest the presence of a relativistic jet oriented towards the line of sight, that is, a blazar nature. However, currently available radio data do not allow us to firmly characterise the orientation of the source. Further radio and X-ray observations are needed.	
 Lensing contribution to the 21cm intensity bispectrum	Rahul Kothari, Roy Maartens	None	None	Intensity maps of the 21cm emission line of neutral hydrogen are lensed by intervening large-scale structure, similar to the lensing of the cosmic microwave background temperature map. We extend previous work by calculating the lensing contribution to the full-sky 21cm bispectrum in redshift space. The lensing contribution tends to peak when equal-redshift fluctuations are lensed by a lower redshift fluctuation. At high redshift, lensing effects can become comparable to the contributions from density and redshift-space distortions.	
 Gamma integral structure for an invertible polynomial of chain type	Takumi Otani, Atsushi Takahashi	u930458f@ecs.osaka-u.ac.jp	"Department of Mathematics, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University,

 Inheritance-guided Hierarchical Assignment for Clinical Automatic Diagnosis	Yichao Du, Pengfei Luo, Xudong Hong, Tong Xu, Zhe Zhang, Chao Ren, Yi Zheng, Enhong Chen	None	None	Clinical diagnosis, which aims to assign diagnosis codes for a patient based on the clinical note, plays an essential role in clinical decision-making. Considering that manual diagnosis could be error-prone and time-consuming, many intelligent approaches based on clinical text mining have been proposed to perform automatic diagnosis. However, these methods may not achieve satisfactory results due to the following challenges. First, most of the diagnosis codes are rare, and the distribution is extremely unbalanced. Second, existing methods are challenging to capture the correlation between diagnosis codes. Third, the lengthy clinical note leads to the excessive dispersion of key information related to codes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework to combine the inheritance-guided hierarchical assignment and co-occurrence graph propagation for clinical automatic diagnosis. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical joint prediction strategy to address the challenge of unbalanced codes distribution. Then, we utilize graph convolutional neural networks to obtain the correlation and semantic representations of medical ontology. Furthermore, we introduce multi attention mechanisms to extract crucial information. Finally, extensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our method.	
 Photon-photon interactions in Rydberg-atom arrays	Lida Zhang, Valentin Walther, Klaus Mlmer, Thomas Pohl	None	None	We investigate the interaction of weak light fields with two-dimensional lattices of atoms with high lying atomic Rydberg states. This system features different interactions that act on disparate length scales, from zero-range defect scattering of atomic excitations and finite-range dipolar exchange processes to long-range Rydberg-state interactions, which span the entire array and can block multiple Rydberg excitations. Analyzing their interplay, we identify conditions that yield a nonlinear quantum mirror which coherently splits incident fields into correlated photon-pairs in a single transverse mode, while transmitting single photons unaffected. In particular, we find strong anti-bunching of the transmitted light with equal-time pair correlations that decrease exponentially with an increasing range of the Rydberg blockade. Such strong photon-photon interactions in the absence of photon losses open up promising avenues for the generation and manipulation of quantum light, and the exploration of many-body phenomena with interacting photons.	
 Learning Abstract Representations through Lossy Compression of Multi-Modal Signals	CharlesWilmot, GianlucaBaldassarre, and JochenTriesch	None	None	A key competence for open-ended learning is the formation of increasingly abstract representations useful for driving complex behavior. Abstract representations ignore specific details and facilitate generalization. Here we consider the learning of abstract representations in a multi-modal setting with two or more input modalities. We treat the problem as a lossy compression problem and show that generic lossy compression of multimodal sensory input naturally extracts abstract representations that tend to strip away modalitiy specific details and preferentially retain information that is shared across the different modalities. Specifically, we propose an architecture that is able to extract information common to different modalities based on the compression abilities of generic autoencoder neural networks. We test the architecture with two tasks that allow 1) the precise manipulation of the amount of information contained in and shared across different modalities and 2) testing the method on a simulated robot with visual and proprioceptive inputs. Our results show the validity of the proposed approach and demonstrate the applicability to embodied agents.

 Countering a fundamental law of attraction with quantum wavepacket engineering	Amit, Japha, Shushi, Folman, Cohen	None	None	Bohmian mechanics was designed to give rise to predictions identical to those derived by standard quantum mechanics, while invoking a specific interpretation of it ‚Äì one which allows the classical notion of a particle to be maintained alongside a guiding wave. For this, the Bohmian model makes use of a unique quantum potential which governs the trajectory of the particle. In this work we show that this interpretation of quantum theory naturally leads to the derivation of interesting new phenomena. Specifically, we demonstrate how the fundamental Casimir-Polder force, by which atoms are attracted to a surface, may be temporarily suppressed by utilizing a specially designed quantum potential. We show that when harnessing the quantum potential via a suitable atomic wavepacket engineering, the absorption by the surface can be dramatically reduced. This is proven both analytically and numerically. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed for achieving the required shape for the atomic wavepacket. All these may enable new insights into Bohmian mechanics as well as new applications to metrology and sensing.

 Extensions of the AZ-algorithm and the Package MultiIntegrate	Jakob Ablinger	None	None	We extend the (continuous) multivariate Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm in order to apply it for instance to special Feynman integrals emerging in renormalizable Quantum field Theories. We will consider multidimensional integrals over hyperexponential integrals and try to find closed form representations in terms of nested sums and products or iterated integrals. In addition, if we fail to compute a closed form solution in full generality, we may succeed in computing the first coefficients of the Laurent series expansions of such integrals in terms of indefinite nested sums and products or iterated integrals. In this article we present the corresponding methods and algorithms. Our Mathematica package MultiIntegrate , can be considered as an enhanced implementation of the (continuous) multivariate Almkvist Zeilberger algorithm to compute recurrences or differential equations for hyperexponential integrands and integrals. Together with the summation package Sigma and the package HarmonicSums our package provides methods to compute closed form representations (or coefficients of the Laurent series expansions) of multidimensional integrals over hyperexponential integrands in terms of nested sums or iterated integrals.	
 Locally Eventually Positive Operator Semigroups	Sahiba Arora	sahiba.arora@mailbox.tu-dresden.de	Sahiba Arora, Technische Universit√§t Dresden, Institut f√ºr Analysis, Fakult√§t f√ºr Mathematik, 01062 Dresden, Germany	We initiate a theory of locally eventually positive operator semigroups on Banach lattices. Intuitively this means: given a positive initial datum, the solution of the corresponding Cauchy problem becomes (and stays) positive in a part of the domain, after a sufficiently large time. A drawback of the present theory of eventually positive C 0 subscript ùê∂ 0 C_{0} italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -semigroups is that it is applicable only when the leading eigenvalue of the semigroup generator has a strongly positive eigenvector. We weaken this requirement and give sufficient criteria for individual and uniform local eventual positivity of the semigroup. This allows us to treat a larger class of examples by giving us more freedom on the domain when dealing with function spaces ‚Äì for instance, the square of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions on L 2 superscript ùêø 2 L^{2} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and the Dirichlet bi-Laplacian on L p superscript ùêø ùëù L^{p} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -spaces. Besides, we establish various spectral and convergence properties of locally eventually positive semigroups.	
 Quantum tomography with random diagonal unitary maps and statistical bounds on information generation using random matrix theory	Sreeram PG, Vaibhav Madhok	None	None	We study quantum tomography from a continuous measurement record obtained by measuring expectation values of a set of Hermitian operators obtained from unitary evolution of an initial observable. For this purpose, we consider the application of a random unitary, diagonal in a fixed basis at each time step and quantify the information gain in tomography using Fisher information of the measurement record and the Shannon entropy associated with the eigenvalues of covariance matrix of the estimation. Surprisingly, very high fidelity of reconstruction is obtained using random unitaries diagonal in a fixed basis even though the measurement record is not informationally complete. We then compare this with the information generated and fidelities obtained by application of a different Haar random unitary at each time step. We give an upper bound on the maximal information that can be obtained in tomography and show that a covariance matrix taken from the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of random matrices and the associated Marchenko-Pastur distribution saturates this bound. We find that physically, this corresponds to an application of a different Haar random unitary at each time step. We show that repeated application of random diagonal unitaries gives a covariance matrix in tomographic estimation that corresponds to a new ensemble of random matrices. We analytically and numerically estimate eigenvalues of this ensemble and show the information gain to be bounded from below by the Porter-Thomas distribution.

 Why polls fail to predict elections	Zhenkun Zhou, Matteo Serafino, Luciano Cohan, Guido Caldarelli, Hernn Makse	None	None	In the past decade we have witnessed the failure of traditional polls in predicting presidential election outcomes across the world. To understand the reasons behind these failures we analyze the raw data of a trusted pollster which failed to predict, along with the rest of the pollsters, the surprising 2019 presidential election in Argentina which has led to a major market collapse in that country. Analysis of the raw and re-weighted data from longitudinal surveys performed before and after the elections reveals clear biases (beyond well-known low-response rates) related to mis-representation of the population and, most importantly, to social-desirability biases, i.e., the tendency of respondents to hide their intention to vote for controversial candidates. We then propose a longitudinal opinion tracking method based on big-data analytics from social media, machine learning, and network theory that overcomes the limits of traditional polls. The model achieves accurate results in the 2019 Argentina elections predicting the overwhelming victory of the candidate Alberto Fern√°ndez over the president Mauricio Macri; a result that none of the traditional pollsters in the country was able to predict. Beyond predicting political elections, the framework we propose is more general and can be used to discover trends in society; for instance, what people think about economics, education or climate change.

Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of quantum information processing hardware is an important step in this process. However, the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments. This transition requires overcoming challenges in engineering and integration without sacrificing the state-of-the-art performance of laboratory implementations. Here, we present a 19-inch rack quantum computing demonstrator based on 40 40 {}^{40} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 40 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ca + {}^{+} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT optical qubits in a linear Paul trap to address many of these challenges. We outline the mechanical, optical, and electrical subsystems. Further, we describe the automation and remote access components of the quantum computing stack. We conclude by describing characterization measurements relevant to quantum computing including site-resolved single-qubit interactions, and entangling operations mediated by the M√∏lmer-S√∏rensen interaction delivered via two distinct addressing approaches. Using this setup we produce maximally-entangled Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger states with up to 24 ions without the use of post-selection or error mitigation techniques; on par with well-established conventional laboratory setups.	
 Self-Calibrating Active Binocular Vision via Active Efficient Coding with Deep Autoencoders	Charles Wilmot, Bertram EShi, Jochen Triesch	None	None	We present a model of the self-calibration of active binocular vision comprising the simultaneous learning of visual representations, vergence, and pursuit eye movements. The model follows the principle of Active Efficient Coding (AEC), a recent extension of the classic Efficient Coding Hypothesis to active perception. In contrast to previous AEC models, the present model uses deep autoencoders to learn sensory representations. We also propose a new formulation of the intrinsic motivation signal that guides the learning of behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the model in simulations.	
 Stability analysis of two-fluid dark energy models	Mishra, Fakhereh Md Esmaeili, Pratik Ray,, Tripathy	None	None	In this paper, we have studied the stability of the cosmological models with dark energy and combination of matter fields and dark energy in an anisotropic space time. The pressure anisotropy along the spatial directions are derived and its stability in each direction has been examined. The four models presented here, show its stability on certain spatial direction. The role of matter field on the stability analysis has been obtained. The positive and negative value of cosmic string completely changed the stability behaviour of the model. The presence of a magnetic field disturbs the stability aspects of the models at least in an early epoch.

 Optimal decay for a wave-heat system with Coleman‚ÄìGurtin thermal law	Filippo DellOro, Lassi Paunonen and David Seifert	filippo.delloro@polimi.it	Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di MilanoVia Bonardi 9, 20133 Milano, Italy	We study the long-term behaviour of solutions to a one-dimensional coupled wave-heat system with Coleman‚ÄìGurtin thermal law. Our approach is based on the asymptotic theory of C 0 subscript ùê∂ 0 C_{0} italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -semigroups and recent results developed for coupled control systems.

 Remote multi-user control of the production of Bose-Einstein condensates for research and education	Laustsen, Heck, Elasson, Arlt, Sherson and Weidner	sherson@phys.au.dk	Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark	Remote control of experimental systems allows for improved collaboration between research groups as well as unique remote educational opportunities accessible by students and citizen scientists. Here, we describe an experiment for the production and investigation of ultracold quantum gases capable of asynchronous remote control by multiple remote users. This is enabled by a queuing system coupled to an interface that can be modified to suit the user, e.g. a gamified interface for use by the general public or a scripted interface for an expert. To demonstrate this, the laboratory was opened to remote experts and the general public. During the available time, remote users were given the task of optimising the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). This work thus provides a stepping stone towards the exploration and realisation of more advanced physical models by remote experts, students and citizen scientists alike.	
 The field theoretical ABC of epidemic dynamics	Giacomo Cacciapaglia, Corentin Cot, Stefan Hohenegger, Shahram Vatani, Michele Della Morte, Francesco Sannino	None	Institut de Physique des 2 Infinis (IP2I), CNRS/IN2P3, UMR5822, 69622 Villeurbanne, FranceUniversit√© de Lyon, Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69001 Lyon, France	Infectious diseases are a threat for human health with tremendous impact on our society at large. They are events that recur with a frequency that is growing with the exponential increase in the world population and growth of the human ecological footprint. The latter causes a frequent spillover of transmissible diseases from wildlife to humans. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is the latest example of a highly infectious disease that, since late 2019, is ravaging the globe with a huge toll in terms of human lives and socio-economic impact. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient mathematical models, able to substantially curb the damages of a pandemic by unveiling disease spreading dynamics and symmetries. This will help inform (non)-pharmaceutical prevention strategies. It is for the reasons above that we decided to write this report. It goes at the heart of mathematical modelling of infectious disease diffusion by simultaneously investigating the underlying microscopic dynamics in terms of percolation models, effective description via compartmental models and the employment of temporal symmetries naturally encoded in the mathematical language of critical phenomena. Our report reviews these approaches and determines their common denominators, relevant for theoretical epidemiology and its link to important concepts in theoretical physics. We show that the different frameworks exhibit common features such as criticality and self-similarity under time rescaling. These features are naturally encoded within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an efficient description of the time evolution of the disease via a framework in which (near) time-dilation invariance is explicitly realised. As important test of the relevance of symmetries we show how to mathematically account for observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. Although we consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an explicit phenomenological application, the models presented here are of immediate relevance for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical applications to the understanding of human behaviour. Our review offers novel perspectives on how to model, capture, organise and understand epidemiological data and disease dynamics for modelling real-world phenomena, and helps devising public health and socio-economics strategies.

 Identification of particle mixtures using machine-learning-assisted laser diffraction analysis	Arturo Villegas, Mario QuirozJurez, Alfred URen, Juan Torres, Roberto de LenMontiel	arturo.villegas@icfo.eu	None	We demonstrate a smart laser-diffraction analysis technique for particle mixture identification. We retrieve information about the size, geometry, and ratio concentration of two-component heterogeneous particle mixtures with an efficiency above 92%. In contrast to commonly-used laser diffraction schemes‚Äîin which a large number of detectors is needed‚Äîour machine-learning-assisted protocol makes use of a single far-field diffraction pattern, contained within a small angle ( ‚àº 0.26 ‚àò similar-to absent superscript 0.26 \sim 0.26^{\circ} ‚àº 0.26 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) around the light propagation axis.

 An Open-source Library of Large Integer Polynomial Multipliers This work was partially supported by the EC through the European Social Fund in the context of the project ‚ÄúICT programme‚Äù. It was also partially supported by the Estonian Research Council grant MOBERC35.			None	Polynomial multiplication is a bottleneck in most of the public-key cryptography protocols, including Elliptic-curve cryptography and several of the post-quantum cryptography algorithms presently being studied. In this paper, we present a library of various large integer polynomial multipliers to be used in hardware cryptocores. Our library contains both digitized and non-digitized multiplier flavours for circuit designers to choose from. The library is supported by a C++ generator that automatically produces the multipliers‚Äô logic in Verilog HDL that is amenable for FPGA and ASIC designs. Moreover, for ASICs, it also generates configurable and parameterizable synthesis scripts. The features of the generator allow for a quick generation and assessment of several architectures at the same time, thus allowing a designer to easily explore the (complex) optimization search space of polynomial multiplication.	
 The relic neutrino composition as seen from Earth	BaushevstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTBogoliubov Laboratory of Theoretical Physics, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research Dubna, Moscow Region, Russia	None	None	Being generated, the relic neutrino background contained equal fractions of electron ŒΩ e subscript ùúà ùëí \nu_{e} italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , muon ŒΩ Œº subscript ùúà ùúá \nu_{\mu} italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and taon ŒΩ œÑ subscript ùúà ùúè \nu_{\tau} italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÑ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT neutrinos.

 Goal-oriented adaptive finite element methods with optimal computational complexity	Roland Becker, Gregor Gantner, Michael Innerberger, Dirk Praetorius	None	Universit√© de Pau et des Pays de l‚ÄôAdour, IPRA-LMAP, Avenue de l‚ÄôUniversit√© BP 1155, 64013 PAU Cedex, France	We consider a linear symmetric and elliptic PDE and a linear goal functional. We design and analyze a goal-oriented adaptive finite element method, which steers the adaptive mesh-refinement as well as the approximate solution of the arising linear systems by means of a contractive iterative solver like the optimally preconditioned conjugate gradient method or geometric multigrid. We prove linear convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm with optimal algebraic rates. Unlike prior work, we do not only consider rates with respect to the number of degrees of freedom but even prove optimal complexity, i.e., optimal convergence rates with respect to the total computational cost.	
 Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second	Daniel Lemire	None	None	With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second, parsing decimal numbers from strings becomes a bottleneck. We consider the problem of parsing decimal numbers to the nearest binary floating-point value. The general problem requires variable-precision arithmetic. However, we need at most 17 digits to represent 64-bit standard floating-point numbers (IEEE 754). Thus we can represent the decimal significand with a single 64-bit word. By combining the significand and precomputed tables, we can compute the nearest floating-point number using as few as one or two 64-bit multiplications.	
 Second-order gravitational self-force in a highly regular gauge	Samuel DUpton, Adam Pound	None	None	Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will be key sources for LISA. However, accurately extracting system parameters from a detected EMRI waveform will require self-force calculations at second order in perturbation theory, which are still in a nascent stage. One major obstacle in these calculations is the strong divergences that are encountered on the worldline of the small object. Previously, it was shown by one of us [ Phys. Rev. D 95, 104056 (2017) ] that a class of ‚Äúhighly regular‚Äù gauges exist in which the singularities have a qualitatively milder form, promising to enable more efficient numerical calculations. Here we derive expressions for the metric perturbation in this class of gauges, in a local expansion in powers of distance r ùëü r italic_r from the worldline, to sufficient order in r ùëü r italic_r for numerical implementation in a puncture scheme. Additionally, we use the highly regular class to rigorously derive a distributional source for the second-order field and a pointlike second-order stress-energy tensor (the Detweiler stress-energy ) for the small object. This makes it possible to calculate the second-order self-force using mode-sum regularisation rather than the more cumbersome puncture schemes that have been necessary previously. Although motivated by EMRIs, our calculations are valid in an arbitrary vacuum background, and they may help clarify the interpretation of point masses and skeleton sources in general relativity more broadly.

In this paper, we propose a novel data analysis framework with reproducing kernel Hilbert C * superscript ùê∂ C^{*} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -module (RKHM) and kernel mean embedding (KME) in RKHM. Since RKHM contains richer information than RKHS or vector-valued RKHS (vvRKHS), analysis with RKHM enables us to capture and extract structural properties in such as functional data. We show a branch of theories for RKHM to apply to data analysis, including the representer theorem, and the injectivity and universality of the proposed KME. We also show RKHM generalizes RKHS and vvRKHS. Then, we provide concrete procedures for employing RKHM and the proposed KME to data analysis.	
 On subadditivity-like conditions for associated weight functions	Gerhard Schindl	gerhard.schindl@univie.ac.at	G.¬†Schindl: Fakult√§t f√ºr Mathematik, Universit√§t Wien, Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz¬†1, A-1090 Wien, Austria.	The aim of this article is to provide characterizations for subadditivity-like growth conditions for the so-called associated weight functions in terms of the defining weight sequence. Such growth requirements arise frequently in the literature and are standard when dealing with ultradifferentiable function classes defined by Braun-Meise-Taylor weight functions since they imply or even characterize important and desired consequences for the underlying function spaces, e.g. closedness under composition.	
 Discrete-Time Quantum-Walk & Floquet Topological Insulators via Distance-Selective Rydberg-Interaction	Mohammadsadegh Khazali	None	None	This article proposes the first discrete-time implementation of Rydberg quantum walk in multi-dimensional spatial space that could ideally simulate different classes of topological insulators. Using distance-selective exchange-interaction between Rydberg excited atoms in an atomic-array with dual lattice-constants, the new setup operates both coined and coin-less models of discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). Here, complicated coupling tessellations are performed by global laser that exclusively excite the site at the anti-blockade region. The long-range interaction provides a new feature of designing different topologically ordered periodic boundary conditions. Limiting the Rydberg population to two excitations, coherent QW over hundreds of lattice sites and steps are achievable with the current technology. These features would improve the performance of this quantum machine in running the quantum search algorithm over topologically ordered databases as well as diversifying the range of topological insulators that could be simulated.

With the help of a Œ∏ ùúÉ \theta italic_Œ∏ -method of Briand and Hu [ 4 ] and nonlinear stochastic analysis techniques, we propose an approximation procedure to prove existence and uniqueness result when the generator is convex (or concave) and terminal value is of exponential moments of arbitrary order. Finally, we also establish the well-posedness of multi-dimensional G ùê∫ G italic_G -BSDEs with diagonally quadratic generators.

Rev. D 100, no.10, 104022 (2019)]. This assumption considers that the energy of the particle changes the enthalpy of the black hole after throwing the particle into the black hole. Using the energy-momentum relation, the results show that the second law of thermodynamics of the black hole is valid in extended phase space. In this paper, we discuss the validity of the laws of thermodynamics and the stability of the horizon of the charged AdS black hole by scalar field scattering under two assumptions, i.e., the energy flux of the scalar field d E ùëë ùê∏ dE italic_d italic_E changes the internal energy of the black hole d U ùëë ùëà dU italic_d italic_U and the energy flux of the scalar field d E ùëë ùê∏ dE italic_d italic_E changes the enthalpy of the black hole d M ùëë ùëÄ dM italic_d italic_M .	
 A Two-Functional-Network Framework of Opinion Dynamics	WentaoZhang,ZhiqiangZuo,and YijingWang	None	None	A common trait involving the opinion dynamics in social networks is an anchor on interacting network to characterize the opinion formation process among participating social actors, such as information flow, cooperative and antagonistic influence, etc. Nevertheless, interacting networks are generally public for social groups, as well as other individuals who may be interested in. This blocks a more precise interpretation of the opinion formation process since social actors always have complex feeling, motivation and behavior, even beliefs that are personally private. In this paper, we formulate a general configuration on describing how individual‚Äôs opinion evolves in a distinct fashion. It consists of two functional networks: interacting network and appraisal network. Interacting network inherits the operational properties as DeGroot iterative opinion pooling scheme while appraisal network, forming a belief system, quantifies certain cognitive orientation to interested individuals‚Äô beliefs, over which the adhered attitudes may have the potential to be antagonistic. We explicitly show that cooperative appraisal network always leads to consensus in opinions. Antagonistic appraisal network, however, causes opinion cluster. It is verified that antagonistic appraisal network affords to guarantee consensus by imposing some extra restrictions. They hence bridge a gap between the consensus and the clusters in opinion dynamics. We further attain a gauge on the appraisal network by means of the random convex optimization approach. Moreover, we extend our results to the case of mutually interdependent issues.	
 Krylov-Simplex method that minimizes the residual in ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-norm or ‚Ñì_‚àû-norm. Draft version of 27 jan 2021	Wim Vanroose, Jeffrey Cornelis	wim.vanroose@uantwerpen.be	None	The paper presents two variants of a Krylov-Simplex iterative method that combines Krylov and simplex iterations to minimize the residual r = b ‚àí A x ùëü ùëè ùê¥ ùë• r=b-Ax italic_r = italic_b - italic_A italic_x . The first method minimizes ‚Äñ r ‚Äñ ‚àû subscript norm ùëü \|r\|_{\infty} ‚à• italic_r ‚à• start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àû end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , i.e. maximum of the absolute residuals. The second minimizes ‚Äñ r ‚Äñ 1 subscript norm ùëü 1 \|r\|_{1} ‚à• italic_r ‚à• start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and finds the solution with the least absolute residuals. Both methods search for an optimal solution x k subscript ùë• ùëò x_{k} italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in a Krylov subspace which results in a small linear programming problem. A specialized simplex algorithm solves this projected problem and finds the optimal linear combination of Krylov basis vectors to approximate the solution. The resulting simplex algorithm requires the solution of a series of small dense linear systems that only differ by rank-one updates. The Q R ùëÑ ùëÖ QR italic_Q italic_R factorization of these matrices is updated each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods with numerical experiments.	
 Importance of electronic correlations for the magnetic properties of the two-dimensional ferromagnet CoBr‚ÇÇ	Hrishit Banerjee, Markus Aichhorn	h.banerjee10@gmail.com	None	We investigate the emergence of ferromagnetism in the two-dimensional metal-halide CoBr 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , with a special focus on the role of electronic correlations. The calculated phonon spectrum shows that the system is thermodynamically stable unlike other Co halides. We apply two well-known methods for the estimation of the Curie temperature. First, we do DFT+U calculations to calculate exchange couplings, which are subsequently used in a classical Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting Ising spin model. The transition temperature calculated in this way is in the order of 100 K, but shows a strong dependence on the choice of interaction parameters. Second, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to calculate the correlated electronic structure and estimate the transition temperature. This results in a similar estimate for a noticeable transition temperature of approximately 100 100 100 100 K, however, without the strong dependence on the interaction parameters. The effect of electron-electron interactions are strongly orbital selective, with only moderate correlations in the three low-lying orbitals (one doublet plus one singlet), and strong correlations in the doublet at higher energy. This can be traced back to the electronic occupation in DMFT, with five electrons in the three low-lying orbitals and two electrons in the high-energy doublet, making the latter one half-filled. Nevertheless, the overall spectral gap is governed by the small gap originating from the low-lying doublet+singlet orbitals, which changes very weakly with interaction U ùëà U italic_U . In that sense, the system is close to a Mott metal-to-insulator transition, which has been shown previously to be a hot-spot for strong magnetism.	
 Spectrum Sharing for 6G Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks Based on NOMA and Cognitive Radio	Xin Liu, KwokYan Lam, Feng Li, Jun Zhao, Li Wang	None	None	The explosive growth of bandwidth hungry Internet applications has led to the rapid development of new generation mobile network technologies that are expected to provide broadband access to the Internet in a pervasive manner. For example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between 3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to 8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing of ISTCN. In essence, NOMA technology improves spectrum efficiency by allowing different users to transmit on the same carrier and distinguishing users by user power levels while CR technology improves spectrum efficiency through dynamic spectrum sharing. Furthermore, some open researches and challenges in ISTCN will be discussed.

 Recent Trends in Named Entity Recognition (NER)	Arya RoyaryaralumnicmueduCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, PA , USA	None	None	The availability of large amounts of computer-readable textual data and hardware that can process the data has shifted the focus of knowledge projects towards deep learning architecture. Natural Language Processing, particularly the task of Named Entity Recognition is no exception. The bulk of the learning methods that have produced state-of-the-art results have changed the deep learning model, the training method used, the training data itself or the encoding of the output of the NER system. In this paper, we review significant learning methods that have been employed for NER in the recent past and how they came about from the linear learning methods of the past. We also cover the progress of related tasks that are upstream or downstream to NER eg. sequence tagging, entity linking etc. wherever the processes in question have also improved NER results.

 geoGAT: Graph Model Based on Attention Mechanism for Geographic Text Classification	Weipeng Jing, Xianyang Song, Donglin Di, Houbing Song	jwp@nefu.edu.cn	None	In the area of geographic information processing. There are few researches on geographic text classification. However, the application of this task in Chinese is relatively rare. In our work, we intend to implement a method to extract text containing geographical entities from a large number of network text. The geographic information in these texts is of great practical significance to transportation, urban and rural planning, disaster relief and other fields. We use the method of graph convolutional neural network with attention mechanism to achieve this function. Graph attention networks is an improvement of graph convolutional neural networks. Compared with GCN, the advantage of GAT is that the attention mechanism is proposed to weight the sum of the characteristics of adjacent nodes. In addition, We construct a Chinese dataset containing geographical classification from multiple datasets of Chinese text classification. The Macro-F Score of the geoGAT we used reached 95% on the new Chinese dataset.	
 Fake News Detection System using XLNet model with Topic Distributions: CONSTRAINT@AAAI2021 Shared Task	Akansha Gautam, Venktesh, Sarah Masud	None	None	With the ease of access to information, and its rapid dissemination over the internet (both velocity and volume), it has become challenging to filter out truthful information from fake ones. The research community is now faced with the task of automatic detection of fake news, which carries real-world socio-political impact. One such research contribution came in the form of the Constraint@AAA12021 Shared Task on COVID19 Fake News Detection in English. In this paper, we shed light on a novel method we proposed as a part of this shared task. Our team introduced an approach to combine topical distributions from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with contextualized representations from XLNet. We also compared our method with existing baselines to show that XLNet + + + Topic Distributions outperforms other approaches by attaining an F1-score of 0.967 0.967 0.967 0.967 .	
 Where have all the solar-like stars gone? Rotation period detectability at various inclinations and metallicities	Timo Reinhold, Alexander Shapiro, Veronika Witzke, NinaE Nmec, Emre Ik, Sami Solanki	None	None	The plethora of photometric data collected by the Kepler space telescope has promoted the detection of tens of thousands of stellar rotation periods. However, these periods are not found to an equal extent among different spectral types. Interestingly, early G-type stars with near-solar rotation periods are strongly underrepresented among those stars with known rotation periods. In this study we investigate whether the small number of such stars can be explained by difficulties in the period determination from photometric time series. For that purpose, we generate model light curves of early G-type stars with solar rotation periods for different inclination angles, metallicities and (magnitude-dependent) noise levels. We find that the detectability is determined by the predominant type of activity (i.e. spot or faculae domination) on the surface, which defines the degree of irregularity of the light curve, and further depends on the level of photometric noise. These two effects significantly complicate the period detection and explain the lack of solar-like stars with known near-solar rotation periods. We conclude that the rotation periods of the majority of solar-like stars with near-solar rotation periods remain undetected to date. Finally, we promote the use of new techniques to recover more periods of near-solar rotators.	
 One Model to Serve All: Star Topology Adaptive Recommender for Multi-Domain CTR Prediction	XiangRong Sheng, Liqin Zhao, Guorui Zhou, Xinyao Ding, Binding Dai, Qiang LuoSiran Yang, Jingshan Lv, Chi Zhang, Hongbo Deng, Xiaoqiang Zhu	None	None	Traditional industry recommendation systems usually use data in a single domain to train models and then serve the domain. However, a large-scale commercial platform often contains multiple domains, and its recommendation system often needs to make click-through rate (CTR) predictions for multiple domains. Generally, different domains may share some common user groups and items, and each domain may have its own unique user groups and items. Moreover, even the same user may have different behaviors in different domains. In order to leverage all the data from different domains, a single model can be trained to serve all domains. However, it is difficult for a single model to capture the characteristics of various domains and serve all domains well. On the other hand, training an individual model for each domain separately does not fully use the data from all domains. In this paper, we propose the Star Topology Adaptive Recommender (STAR) model to train a single model to serve all domains by leveraging data from all domains simultaneously, capturing the characteristics of each domain, and modeling the commonalities between different domains. Essentially, the network of each domain consists of two factorized networks: one centered network shared by all domains and the domain-specific network tailored for each domain. For each domain, we combine these two factorized networks and generate a unified network by element-wise multiplying the weights of the shared network and those of the domain-specific network, although these two factorized networks can be combined using other functions, which is open for further research. Most importantly, STAR can learn the shared network from all the data and adapt domain-specific parameters according to the characteristics of each domain. The experimental results from production data validate the superiority of the proposed STAR model. Since late 2020, STAR has been deployed in the display advertising system of Alibaba, obtaining 8.0% improvement on CTR and 6.0% increase on RPM (Revenue Per Mille).

 TSQA: Tabular Scenario Based Question Answering	Xiao Li,Yawei Sun,Gong Cheng	None	None	Scenario-based question answering (SQA) has attracted an increasing research interest. Compared with the well-studied machine reading comprehension (MRC), SQA is a more challenging task: a scenario may contain not only a textual passage to read but also structured data like tables, i.e., tabular scenario based question answering (TSQA). AI applications of TSQA such as answering multiple-choice questions in high-school exams require synthesizing data in multiple cells and combining tables with texts and domain knowledge to infer answers. To support the study of this task, we construct GeoTSQA. This dataset contains 1k real questions contextualized by tabular scenarios in the geography domain. To solve the task, we extend state-of-the-art MRC methods with TTGen, a novel table-to-text generator. It generates sentences from variously synthesized tabular data and feeds the downstream MRC method with the most useful sentences. Its sentence ranking model fuses the information in the scenario, question, and domain knowledge. Our approach outperforms a variety of strong baseline methods on GeoTSQA.	
 An Explainable CNN Approach for Medical Codes Prediction from Clinical Text	Hu SYShuYuan Hu, Teng FFei Teng	None	\orgnameLeeds joint School, SWJTU,\cityCheng Du,\cnyChina	Background Clinical notes are unstructured text documents generated by clinicians during patient encounters, generally are annotated with ICD codes, which give formatted information about the diagnosis and treatment. ICD code has shown its potentials in many fields, but manual coding is labor-intensive and error-prone, lead to researches of automatic coding. Two specific challenges of this task are 1) given an annotated clinical notes, the reasons behind specific diagnoses and treatments are lost; 2) explainability is important for practical automatic coding method, the method should not only explain its prediction output but also have explainable internal mechanics. This study aims to develop an explainable CNN approach to address these two challenges.

 Spin-memory loss induced by bulk spin-orbit coupling at ferromagnet/heavy-metal interfaces	Mijin Lim, HyunWoo Lee	None	None	A spin current through a ferromagnet/heavy-metal interface may shrink due to the spin-flip at the interface, resulting in the spin-memory loss. Here we propose a mechanism of the spin-memory loss. In contrast to other mechanisms based on interfacial spin-orbit coupling, our mechanism is based on the bulk spin-orbit coupling in a heavy-metal. We demonstrate that the bulk spin-orbit coupling induces the entanglement between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom and this spin-orbital entanglement can give rise to sizable spin-flip at the interface even when the interfacial spin-orbit coupling is weak. Our mechanism emphasizes crucial roles of the atomic orbital degree of freedom and induces the strong spin-memory loss near band crossing points between bands of different orbital characters.

 Adversaries in Online Learning Revisited: with applications in Robust Optimization and Adversarial training	Sebastian Pokutta, Huan Xu	None	None	We revisit the concept of ‚Äúadversary‚Äù in online learning, motivated by solving robust optimization and adversarial training using online learning methods. While one of the classical setups in online learning deals with the ‚Äúadversarial‚Äù setup, it appears that this concept is used less rigorously, causing confusion in applying results and insights from online learning. Specifically, there are two fundamentally different types of adversaries, depending on whether the ‚Äúadversary‚Äù is able to anticipate the exogenous randomness of the online learning algorithms. This is particularly relevant to robust optimization and adversarial training because the adversarial sequences are often anticipative, and many online learning algorithms do not achieve diminishing regret in such a case.	
 Monitoring and Forecasting COVID-19: Statistical Heuristic Regression, Susceptible-Infected-Removed model and, Spatial Stochastics	Pedro de Andres, Lucia de AndresBragado, Linard Hoessly	None	None	The COVID-19 pandemic has had worldwide devastating effects on human lives, highlighting the need for tools to predict its development. The dynamics of such public-health threats can often be efficiently analysed through simple models that help to make quantitative timely policy decisions. We benchmark a minimal version of a Susceptible-Infected-Removed model for infectious diseases (SIR) coupled with a simple least-squares Statistical Heuristic Regression (SHR) based on a lognormal distribution. We derive the three free parameters for both models in several cases and test them against the amount of data needed to bring accuracy in predictions. The SHR model is ‚âà ¬± 2 % absent plus-or-minus percent 2 \approx\pm 2\% ‚âà ¬± 2 % accurate about 20 days past the second inflexion point in the daily curve of cases, while the SIR model reaches a similar accuracy a fortnight before. All the analysed cases assert the utility of SHR and SIR approximants as a valuable tool to forecast the disease‚Äôs evolution. Finally, we have studied simulated stochastic individual-based SIR dynamics, which yields a detailed spatial and temporal view of the disease that cannot be given by SIR or SHR methods.	
 Mapping the Sun‚Äôs upper photosphere with artificial neural networks	SocasNavarro, Asensio Ramos	None	None	We have developed an inversion procedure designed for high-resolution solar spectro-polarimeters, such as Hinode/SP or DKIST/ViSP. The procedure is based on artificial neural networks trained with profiles generated from random atmospheric stratifications for a high generalization capability. When applied to Hinode data we find a hot fine-scale network structure whose morphology changes with height. In the middle layers this network resembles what is observed in G-band filtergrams but it is not identical. Surprisingly, the temperature enhancements in the middle and upper photosphere have a reversed pattern. Hot pixels in the middle photosphere, possibly associated to small-scale magnetic elements, appear cool at the log ‚Å° œÑ 500 subscript ùúè 500 \log\tau_{500} roman_log italic_œÑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 500 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ‚àí 3 3 -3 - 3 and ‚àí 4 4 -4 - 4 level, and viceversa.

 The large-scale magnetic field advected in the corona of a thin accretion disk	Jiawen Li, Xinwu Cao	None	None	Large-scale magnetic field is believed to play a key role in launching and collimating jets/outflows. It was found that advection of external field by a geometrically thin disk is rather inefficient, while the external weak field may be dragged inwards by fast radially moving tenuous or/and hot gas above the thin disk. We investigate the field advection in a thin (cold) accretion disk covered with hot corona, in which turbulence is responsible for the angular momentum transfer of the gas in the disk and corona. The radial velocity of the gas in the corona is significantly higher than that in the thin disk. Our calculations show that the external magnetic flux is eÔ¨Äiciently transported inwards by the corona, and the field line is strongly inclined towards the disk surface, which help launching outflows. The field configurations are consistent with those observed in the numerical simulations. The strength of the field is substantially enhanced in the inner region of the disk (usually several orders of magnitude higher than the external field strength), which is able to drive a fraction of gas in the corona into outflows. This mechanism may be useful in explaining the observational features in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Our results may help understanding the physics of the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.	
 Can a patchy model describe the potential spread of West Nile virus in Germany?	Suman Bhowmick, Jrn Gethmann, Igor Sokolov, Franz Conraths, Hartmut Lentz	None	Friedrich-Loeffler-InstitutInstitute of EpidemiologyS√ºdufer 10, 17493 Greifswald, Germany	In 2018 2018 2018 2018 , West Nile Virus (WNV) was detected for the first time in Germany. Since the first detection, 36 human cases and 175 cases in horses and birds are detected. The transmission cycle of West Nile Virus includes birds and mosquitoes and ‚Äì as dead-end hosts ‚Äì people and horses. Spatial dissemination of the disease is caused by the movements of birds and mosquitoes. While the activity and movement of mosquitoes are depending mainly on temperature, in the birds there is a complex movement pattern caused by local birds and long range dispersal birds. To this end, we have developed a metapopulation network model framework to delineate the potential spatial distribution and spread of WNV across Germany as well as to evaluate the risk throughout our proposed network model. Our model facilitates the interconnection amongst the vector, local birds and long range dispersal birds contact networks. We have assumed different distance dispersal kernels models for the vector and avian populations with the intention to include short and long range dispersal. The model includes spatial variation of mosquito abundance and the movements to resemble the reality.	
 Offline Correction of Atmospheric Effects on Single-Dish Radio Spectroscopy	Tsuyoshi Sawada, ChinShin Chang, Harold Francke, Laura Gomez, Jeffrey GMangum, Yusuke Miyamoto, Takeshi Nakazato, Suminori Nishie, Neil MPhillips, Yoshito Shimajiri, Kanako Sugimoto	None	None	We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.	
 ‚ÄôControlling by Showing: i-Mimic‚Äô: A Video-based Method to Control Robotic Arms	Debarati Chakraborty, Mukesh Sharma, Bhaskar Vijay	debarati.earth@gmail.com	Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, India	A novel concept of vision-based intelligent control of robotic arms is developed here in this work. This work enables the controlling of robotic arms motion only with visual inputs, that is, controlling by showing the videos of correct movements. This work can broadly be sub-divided into two segments. The first part of this work is to develop an unsupervised vision-based method to control robotic arm in 2-D plane, and the second one is with deep CNN in the same task in 3-D plane. The first method is unsupervised, where our aim is to perform mimicking of human arm motion in real-time by a manipulator. Mimicking, here involves a series of steps, namely, tracking the motion of the arm in videos, estimating motion parameters, and replicating the motion parameters in the robot. We developed a network, namely the vision-to-motion optical network (DON), where the input should be a video stream containing hand movements of human, the the output would be out the velocity and torque information of the hand movements shown in the videos. The output information of the DON is then fed to the robotic arm by enabling it to generate motion according to the real hand videos. The method has been tested with both live-stream video feed as well as on recorded video obtained from a monocular camera. Besides, the DON also enables a method to behave intelligently by predicting the trajectory of human hand even if the hand gets occluded for some time with varying degree of occlusion. This is why the mimicry of the arm incorporates some intelligence to it and becomes intelligent mimic (i- mimic). Alongside the unsupervised method another method has also been developed deploying the deep neural network technique with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the mimicking, where labelled datasets are used for training. The same dataset, as used in the unsupervised DON-based method, is used in the deep CNN method, after manual annotations. Both the proposed methods are validated with off-line as well as with on-line video datasets in real-time, enabling the robotic arm in ‚Äôi- mimic‚Äô and thereby showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The entire methodology is validated with real-time 1-link and simulated n-link manipulators alongwith suitable comparisons.	
 Robust Instability Radius for Multi-agent Dynamical Systems with Cyclic Structure	Shinji HaradaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tetsuya IwasakistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Yutaka HoristartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	This paper is concerned with robust instability analysis for linear multi-agent dynamical systems with cyclic structure. This relates to interesting and important periodic oscillation phenomena in biology and neuronal science, since the nonlinear phenomena often occur when the linearized model around an equilibrium point is unstable. We first make a problem setting on the analysis and define the notion of robust instability radius (RIR) as a quantitative measure for maximum allowable stable dynamic perturbation in terms of the H ùêª H italic_H -infinity norm. After showing lower bounds of the RIR, we derive the exact RIR, which is analytic and scalable, for first order time-lag agents. Finally, we make a remark on the potential applicability to some classes of higher order systems.	
 Meta Adversarial Training against Universal Patches	Jan Hendrik Metzen, Nicole Finnie, Robin Hutmacher	None	None	Recently demonstrated physical-world adversarial attacks have exposed vulnerabilities in perception systems that pose severe risks for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. These attacks place adversarial artifacts in the physical world that indirectly cause the addition of a universal patch to inputs of a model that can fool it in a variety of contexts. Adversarial training is the most effective defense against image-dependent adversarial attacks. However, tailoring adversarial training to universal patches is computationally expensive since the optimal universal patch depends on the model weights which change during training. We propose meta adversarial training (MAT), a novel combination of adversarial training with meta-learning, which overcomes this challenge by meta-learning universal patches along with model training. MAT requires little extra computation while continuously adapting a large set of patches to the current model. MAT considerably increases robustness against universal patch attacks on image classification and traffic-light detection.

 Global Existence of Classical Solutions for a Reactive Polymeric Fluid near Equilibrium	Chun Liu, Yiwei Wang, TengFei ZhangdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	cliu124@iit.edu	Department of Applied Mathematics, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL 60616, USA	In this paper, we study a new micro-macro model for a reactive polymeric fluid, which is derived recently in [Y. Wang, T.-F. Zhang, and C. Liu, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 293 (2021), 104559, 13 pp], by using the energetic variational approach. The model couples the breaking/reforming reaction scheme of the microscopic polymers with other mechanical effects in usual viscoelastic complex fluids. We establish the global existence of classical solutions near the global equilibrium, in which the treatment on the chemo-mechanical coupling effect is the most crucial part. In particular, a weighted Poincar√© inequality with a mean value is employed to overcome the difficulty that arises from the non-conservative number density distribution of each species.

Brigham Young University,
Provo, UT 84602, USA"	In this paper we develop a new approach to the study of uncountable fundamental groups by using Hurewicz fibrations with the unique path-lifting property ( lifting spaces for short) as a replacement for covering spaces. In particular, we consider the inverse limit of a sequence of covering spaces of X ùëã X italic_X . It is known that the path-connectivity of the inverse limit can be expressed by means of the derived inverse limit functor lim ‚Üê 1 superscript projective-limit 1 \varprojlim^{1} start_LIMITOP under‚Üê start_ARG roman_lim end_ARG end_LIMITOP start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , which is, however, notoriously difficult to compute when the œÄ 1 ( X ) subscript ùúã 1 ùëã \pi_{1}(X) italic_œÄ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X ) is uncountable. To circumvent this difficulty, we express the set of path-components of the inverse limit, X ~ ~ ùëã {\widetilde{X}} over~ start_ARG italic_X end_ARG , in terms of the functors lim ‚Üê projective-limit \varprojlim start_LIMITOP under‚Üê start_ARG roman_lim end_ARG end_LIMITOP and lim ‚Üê 1 superscript projective-limit 1 \varprojlim^{1} start_LIMITOP under‚Üê start_ARG roman_lim end_ARG end_LIMITOP start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT applied to sequences of countable groups arising from polyhedral approximations of X ùëã X italic_X .	
 Iwahori-Hecke model for mod ùëù representations of GL‚ÇÇ‚Å¢(ùêπ)	Anandavardhanan and Arindam Jana	anand@math.iitb.ac.in	Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai - 400076, India.	For a p ùëù p italic_p -adic field F ùêπ F italic_F , the space of pro- p ùëù p italic_p -Iwahori invariants of a universal supersingular mod p ùëù p italic_p representation œÑ ùúè \tau italic_œÑ of GL 2 ( F ) subscript GL 2 ùêπ {\rm GL}_{2}(F) roman_GL start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_F ) is determined in the works of Breuil, Schein, and Hendel. The representation œÑ ùúè \tau italic_œÑ is introduced by Barthel and Livn√© and this is defined in terms of the spherical Hecke operator. In [ AB13 , AB15 ] , an Iwahori-Hecke approach was introduced to study these universal supersingular representations in which they can be characterized via the Iwahori-Hecke operators. In this paper, we construct a certain quotient œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ of œÑ ùúè \tau italic_œÑ , making use of the Iwahori-Hecke operators. When F ùêπ F italic_F is not totally ramified over ‚Ñö p subscript ‚Ñö ùëù \mathbb{Q}_{p} blackboard_Q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , the representation œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ is a non-trivial quotient of œÑ ùúè \tau italic_œÑ . We determine a basis for the space of invariants of œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ under the pro-p Iwahori subgroup. A pleasant feature of this ‚Äùnew‚Äù representation œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ is that its space of pro- p ùëù p italic_p -Iwahori invariants admits a more uniform description vis-√†-vis the description of the space of pro- p ùëù p italic_p -Iwahori invariants of œÑ ùúè \tau italic_œÑ .	
 Piecewise Non-Linearity and Capacitance in the Joint Density Functional Theory of Extended Interfaces	Tobias Binninger	tobias.binninger.science@gmx.de	None	The ab initio simulation of charged interfaces in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) is heavily employed for the study of electrochemical energy conversion processes. The capacitance is the primary descriptor for the response of the electrochemical interface. It is essentially equal to the inverse of the energy curvature as a function of electron number, and as such there appears a conflict with the fundamental principle of piecewise linearity in DFT that requires the energy curvature to be zero at fractional electron numbers, i.e. almost everywhere. To resolve this conflict, we derive an exact expression between the energy curvature and the Kohn-Sham density of states, the local density of states, and the Fukui potential. We find that the piecewise linearity requirement does not hold for the volume- or area-specific energy of extended systems and surfaces. Applied to the joint density functional theory of an electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interface, including the ionic and dielectric response of the electrolyte, the same expression represents a rigorous basis for the partitioning of the total interfacial capacitance into contributions of the quantum capacitance, space-charge capacitance, and electrochemical double-layer capacitance. It provides insight into the influence of the electrode material, thickness, and temperature on the charging characteristics, as demonstrated by results for a bulk gold electrode, a single-layer gold electrode, and a single-layer graphene electrode.	
 1 Introduction			None	In this article we consider the estimation of the log-normalization constant associated to a class of continuous-time filtering models. In particular, we consider ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter based estimates based upon several nonlinear Kalman-Bucy diffusions. Based upon new conditional bias results for the mean of the afore-mentioned methods, we analyze the empirical log-scale normalization constants in terms of their ùïÉ n ‚àí limit-from subscript ùïÉ ùëõ \mathbb{L}_{n}- blackboard_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - errors and conditional bias. Depending on the type of nonlinear Kalman-Bucy diffusion, we show that these are of order ( t 1 / 2 / N 1 / 2 ) + t / N superscript ùë° 1 2 superscript ùëÅ 1 2 ùë° ùëÅ (t^{1/2}/N^{1/2})+t/N ( italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / italic_N start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) + italic_t / italic_N or 1 / N 1 / 2 1 superscript ùëÅ 1 2 1/N^{1/2} 1 / italic_N start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( ùïÉ n ‚àí limit-from subscript ùïÉ ùëõ \mathbb{L}_{n}- blackboard_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - errors) and of order [ t + t 1 / 2 ] / N delimited-[] ùë° superscript ùë° 1 2 ùëÅ [t+t^{1/2}]/N [ italic_t + italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ] / italic_N or 1 / N 1 ùëÅ 1/N 1 / italic_N (conditional bias), where t ùë° t italic_t is the time horizon and N ùëÅ N italic_N is the ensemble size. Finally, we use these results for online static parameter estimation for above filtering models and implement the methodology for both linear and nonlinear models.

 Contents			None	Abstract Thanks to the availability of powerful computing resources, big data and deep learning algorithms, we have made great progress on computer vision in the last few years. Computer vision systems begin to surpass humans in some tasks, such as object recognition, object detection, face recognition and pose estimation. Lots of computer vision algorithms have been deployed to real world applications and started to improve our life quality. However, big data and labels are not always available. Sometimes we only have very limited labeled data, such as medical images which requires experts to label them. In this paper, we study few shot image classification, in which we only have very few labeled data.

 Hiding Behind Machines: When Blame Is Shifted to Artificial Agents	Till Feier, Jan Gogoll, Matthias Uhl	None	None	The transfer of tasks with sometimes far-reaching moral implications to autonomous systems raises a number of ethical questions. In addition to fundamental questions about the moral agency of these systems, behavioral issues arise. This article focuses on the responsibility of agents who decide on our behalf. We investigate the empirically accessible question of whether the production of moral outcomes by an agent is systematically judged differently when the agent is artificial and not human. The results of a laboratory experiment suggest that decision-makers can actually rid themselves of guilt more easily by delegating to machines than by delegating to other people. Our results imply that the availability of artificial agents could provide stronger incentives for decision makers to delegate morally sensitive decisions.

Federico Nesti,Alessandro Biondi, andGiorgio Buttazzo,	None	None	Over the last few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved to reach super-human performance in visual recognition tasks. However, CNNs can easily be fooled by adversarial examples, i.e., maliciously-crafted images that force the networks to predict an incorrect output while being extremely similar to those for which a correct output is predicted. Regular adversarial examples are not robust to input image transformations, which can then be used to detect whether an adversarial example is presented to the network. Nevertheless, it is still possible to generate adversarial examples that are robust to such transformations.	
 Fluid dynamics in the warp drive spacetime geometry	Osvaldo LSantosPereira, Everton MCAbreu, Marcelo Ribeiro	olsp@if.ufrj.br	None	The Alcubierre warp drive metric is a spacetime geometry featuring a spacetime distortion, called warp bubble, where a massive particle inside it acquires global superluminal velocities, or warp speeds. This work presents solutions of the Einstein equations for the Alcubierre metric having fluid matter as gravity source. The energy-momentum tensor considered two fluid contents, the perfect fluid and the parametrized perfect fluid (PPF), a tentative more flexible model whose aim is to explore the possibilities of warp drive solutions with positive matter density content. Santos-Pereira et al. (2020) already showed that the Alcubierre metric having dust as source connects this geometry to the Burgers equation, which describes shock waves moving through an inviscid fluid, but led the solutions back to vacuum. The same happened for two out of four solutions subcases for the perfect fluid. Other solutions for the perfect fluid indicate the possibility of warp drive with positive matter density, but at the cost of a complex solution for the warp drive regulating function. Regarding the PPF, solutions were also obtained indicating that warp speeds could be created with positive matter density. Weak, dominant, strong and null energy conditions were calculated for all studied subcases, being satisfied for the perfect fluid and creating constraints in the PPF quantities such that positive matter density is also possible for creating a warp bubble. Summing up all results, energy-momentum tensors describing more complex forms of matter, or field, distributions generate solutions for the Einstein equations with the warp drive metric where negative matter density might not be a strict precondition for attaining warp speeds.

 Listwise Deletion in High Dimensions	Sophia Wang and Aronow	None	None	We consider the properties of listwise deletion when both n ùëõ n italic_n and the number of variables grow large. We show that when (i) all data has some idiosyncratic missingness and (ii) the number of variables grows superlogarithmically in n ùëõ n italic_n , then, for large n ùëõ n italic_n , listwise deletion will drop all rows with probability 1. Using two canonical datasets from the study of comparative politics and international relations, we provide numerical illustration that these problems may emerge in real world settings. These results suggest, in practice, using listwise deletion may mean using few of the variables available to the researcher.	
 Ticks on the run: A mathematical model of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) ‚Äì key factors for transmission1footnote 11footnote 1	Suman Bhowmick, Khushal Khan Kasi, Jrn Gethmann, Susanne Fischer, Franz Conraths, Igor Sokolov, Hartmut Lentz	None	Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Institute of Epidemiology, S√ºdufer 10, 17493 Greifswald, Germany	Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic disease caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Ticks belonging to the genus Hyalomma are the main vectors and reservoir for the virus. It is maintained in nature in an endemic vertebrate-tick-vertebrate cycle. CCHFV is prevalent in wide geographical areas including Asia, Africa, South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Over the last decade, several outbreaks of CCHFV have been observed in Europe, mainly in Mediterranean countries. Due to the high case/fatality ratio of CCHFV in human sometimes, it is of great importance for public health. Climate change and the invasion of CCHFV vectors in Central Europe suggest that the establishment of the transmission in Central Europe may be possible in future.

 Formulating and solving integrated order batching and routing in multi-depot AGV-assisted mixed-shelves warehouses	Lin Xie, Hanyi Li, Laurin Luttmann	xie@leuphana.de	Leuphana University of L√ºneburg, Universit√§tallee 1, 21335 L√ºneburg	Different retail and e-commerce companies are facing the challenge of assembling large numbers of time-critical picking orders that include both small-line and multi-line orders. To reduce unproductive picker working time as in traditional picker-to-parts warehousing systems, different solutions are proposed in the literature and in practice. For example, in a mixed-shelves storage policy, items of the same stock keeping unit are spread over several shelves in a warehouse; or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used to transport the picked items from the storage area to packing stations instead of human pickers. This is the first paper to combine both solutions, creating what we call AGV-assisted mixed-shelves picking systems . We model the new integrated order batching and routing problem in such systems as an extended multi-depot vehicle routing problem with both three-index and two-commodity network flow formulations. Due to the complexity of the integrated problem, we develop a novel variable neighborhood search algorithm to solve the integrated problem more efficiently. We test our methods with different sizes of instances, and conclude that the mixed-shelves storage policy is more suitable than the usual storage policy in AGV-assisted mixed-shelves systems for orders with different sizes of order lines (saving up to 62% on driving distances for AGVs). Our variable neighborhood search algorithm provides optimal solutions within an acceptable computational time.	
 Unveiling the Two-Proton Halo Character of ¬π‚Å∑Ne: Exclusive Measurement of Quasi-free Proton-Knockout Reactions	CLehr, FWamers, FAksouh, YuAksyutina, HlvarezPol, LAtar, TAumann, SBeceiroNovo, CABertulani, KBoretzky, MJGBorge, CCaesar, MChartier, AChatillon, LVChulkov, DCortinaGil, PDaz Fernndez, HEmling, OErshova, LMFraile, HOUFynbo, DGalaviz, HGeissel, MHeil, MHeine, DHHHoffmann, MHoll, HTJohansson, BJonson, CKaragiannis, OAKiselev, JVKratz, RKulessa, NKurz, CLanger, MLantz, TLeBleis, RLemmon, YuALitvinov, BLher, KMahata, JMarganiecGalzka, CMntz, TNilsson, CNociforo, WOtt, VPanin, SPaschalis, APerea, RPlag, RReifarth, ARichter, KRiisager, CRodriguezTajes, DRossi, DSavran, HScheit, GSchrieder, PSchrock, HSimon, JStroth, KSmmerer, OTengblad, HWeick, CWimmer	None	None	The proton drip-line nucleus 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne is investigated experimentally in order to determine its two-proton halo character. A fully exclusive measurement of the 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne ( p , 2 p ) 16 superscript ùëù 2 ùëù 16 (p,2p)^{16} ( italic_p , 2 italic_p ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT F ‚Üí 15 * {}^{*}\rightarrow^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT * end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Üí start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT O + p ùëù +p + italic_p quasi-free one-proton knockout reaction has been performed at GSI at around 500 MeV/nucleon beam energy. All particles resulting from the scattering process have been detected. The relevant reconstructed quantities are the angles of the two protons scattered in qusi-elastic kinematics, the decay of 16 16 {}^{16} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT F into 15 15 {}^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT O (including Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ decays from excited states) and a proton, as well as the 15 15 {}^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT O + p ùëù +p + italic_p relative-energy spectrum and the 16 16 {}^{16} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 16 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT F momentum distributions. The latter two quantities allow an independent and consistent determination of the ratio of l = 0 ùëô 0 l=0 italic_l = 0 and l = 2 ùëô 2 l=2 italic_l = 2 motion of the valence protons in 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne. With a resulting relatively small l = 0 ùëô 0 l=0 italic_l = 0 component of only around 35(3)%, it is concluded that 17 17 {}^{17} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Ne exhibits a rather modest halo character only. The quantitative agreement of the two values deduced from the energy spectrum and the momentum distributions supports the theoretical treatment of the calculation of momentum distributions after quasi-free knockout reactions at high energies by taking into account distortions based on the Glauber theory. Moreover, the experimental data allow the separation of valence-proton knockout and knockout from the 15 15 {}^{15} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 15 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT O core. The latter process contributes with 11.8(3.1) mb around 40% to the total proton-knockout cross section of 30.3(2.3) mb, which explains previously reported contradicting conclusions derived from inclusive cross sections.	
 Improved Wall-Normal Derivative Formulae for Anisotropic Adaptive Simplex-Element Grids	Hiroaki Nishikawa	None	None	In this paper, we explore methods for computing wall-normal derivatives used for calculating wall skin friction and heat transfer over a solid wall in unstructured simplex-element (triangular/tetrahedral) grids generated by anisotropic grid adaptation. Simplex-element grids are considered as efficient and suitable for automatic grid generation and adaptation, but present a challenge to accurately predict wall-normal derivatives. For example, wall-normal derivatives computed by a simple finite-difference approximation, as typically done in practical fluid-dynamics simulation codes, are often contaminated with numerical noise. To address this issue, we propose an improved method based on a common step-length for the finite-difference approximation, which is otherwise random due to grid irregularity and thus expected to smooth the wall-normal derivative distribution over a boundary. Also, we consider using least-squares gradients to compute the wall-normal derivatives and discuss their possible improvements. Numerical results show that the improved methods greatly reduce the noise in the wall-normal derivatives for irregular simplex-element grids.	
 Utilizing uncertainty estimation in deep learning segmentation of fluorescence microscopy images with missing markers			None	Fluorescence microscopy images contain several channels, each indicating a marker staining the sample. Since many different marker combinations are utilized in practice, it has been challenging to apply deep learning based segmentation models, which expect a predefined channel combination for all training samples as well as at inference for future application. Recent work circumvents this problem using a modality attention approach to be effective across any possible marker combination. However, for combinations that do not exist in a labeled training dataset, one cannot have any estimation of potential segmentation quality if that combination is encountered during inference. Without this, not only one lacks quality assurance but one also does not know where to put any additional imaging and labeling effort. We herein propose a method to estimate segmentation quality on unlabeled images by ( i ùëñ i italic_i ) estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of convolutional neural networks for image segmentation, and ( i i ùëñ ùëñ ii italic_i italic_i ) training a Random Forest model for the interpretation of uncertainty features via regression to their corresponding segmentation metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate that including these uncertainty measures during training can provide an improvement on segmentation performance.

 Deep Neural Networks for Active Wave Breaking Classification	Caio Stringari, Pedro Guimares, JeanFranois Filipot, Fabien Leckler, Rui Duarte	None	None	Wave breaking is an important process for energy dissipation in the open ocean and coastal seas. It drives beach morphodynamics, controls air-sea interactions, determines when ship and offshore structure operations can occur safely, and influences on the retrieval of ocean properties from satellites. Still, wave breaking lacks a proper physical understanding mainly due to scarce observational field data. Consequently, new methods and data are required to improve our current understanding of this process. In this paper we present a novel machine learning method to detect active wave breaking, that is, waves that are actively generating visible bubble entrainment in video imagery data. The present method is based on classical machine learning and deep learning techniques and is made freely available to the community alongside this publication. The results indicate that our best performing model had a balanced classification accuracy score of ‚âà \approx ‚âà 90% when classifying active wave breaking in the test dataset. An example of a direct application of the method includes a statistical description of geometrical and kinematic properties of breaking waves. We expect that the present method and the associated dataset will be crucial for future research related to wave breaking in several areas of research, which include but are not limited to: improving operational forecast models, developing risk assessment and coastal management tools, and refining the retrieval of remotely sensed ocean properties.

A formulation for a discrete dynamical system is proposed aiming at reproducing the evolution in time of the density of vehicles along a road, as observed in the measurements. This system is formulated as a chemical reaction network where road cells are interpreted as compartments, the transfer of vehicles from one cell to the other is seen as a chemical reaction between adjacent compartment and the density of vehicles is seen as a concentration of reactant. Several degrees of flexibility on the parameters of this system, which basically consist of the reaction rates between the compartments, can be considered: a constant value or a function depending on time and/or space. Density measurements coming from trajectory data are then interpreted as observations of the states of this system at consecutive times. Optimal reaction rates for the system are then obtained by minimizing the discrepancy between the output of the system and the state measurements. This approach was tested both on simulated and real data, proved successful in recreating the complexity of traffic flows despite the assumptions on the flux-density relation.

 K√§hler geometry of quiver varieties and machine learning	George Jeffreys, SiuCheong Lau	georgej@bu.edu	Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Boston University, 111 Cummington Mall, Boston MA 02215, USA	We develop an algebro-geometric formulation for neural networks in machine learning using the moduli space of framed quiver representations. We find natural Hermitian metrics on the universal bundles over the moduli which are compatible with the GIT quotient construction by the general linear group, and show that their Ricci curvatures give a K√§hler metric on the moduli. Moreover, we use toric moment maps to construct activation functions, and prove the universal approximation theorem for the multi-variable activation function constructed from the complex projective space.	
 Enhanced solar photocurrent using a quantum-dot molecule	Lira, VillasBoas, Sanz, Alcalde	jefferson.santos@ufu.br	None	We present a detailed study on the influence of coherent tunneling on the photovoltaic properties of a semiconductor molecule driven by solar radiation. The connection between the power delivered by the QDM and quantum coherence is not simply proportional but depends on an interplay between the interdot coherent tunneling, the interaction of the system with thermal phonon reservoirs, and the resonance between the QDM and conduction bands. We explored numerically various parameter regimes and found that the maximum power delivered by the molecule is up to 30% greater than the power delivered by a single quantum-dot device. The calculated photovoltaic conversion efficiency is presented in terms of accessible experimental parameters and, as expected, is constrained by the second law.

 Non-Asymptotic Converse Bounds Via Auxiliary Channels	Ioannis Papoutsidakis, Robert Piechocki, and Angela Doufexi	None	None	This paper presents a new derivation method of converse bounds on the non-asymptotic achievable rate of discrete weakly symmetric memoryless channels. It is based on the finite blocklength statistics of the channel, where with the use of an auxiliary channel the converse bound is produced. This method is general and initially is presented for an arbitrary weakly symmetric channel. Afterwards, the main result is specialized for the q ùëû q italic_q -ary erasure channel (QEC), binary symmetric channel (BSC), and QEC with stop feedback. Numerical evaluations show identical or comparable bounds to the state-of-the-art in the cases of QEC and BSC, and a tighter bound for the QEC with stop feedback.	
 Iterated primitives of meromorphic quasimodular forms for SL‚ÇÇ(‚Ñ§)	Nils Matthes	nils.matthes@maths.ox.ac.uk	Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Andrew Wiles Building, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6GG, United Kingdom	We introduce and study iterated primitives of meromorphic quasimodular forms for SL 2 ‚Å° ( ‚Ñ§ ) subscript SL 2 ‚Ñ§ \operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}) roman_SL start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( blackboard_Z ) , generalizing work of Manin and Brown for holomorphic modular forms.

We also study spaces of meromorphic modular forms with restricted poles, generalizing results of Guerzhoy in the weakly holomorphic case.	
 On the Evolution of Syntactic Information Encoded by BERT‚Äôs Contextualized Representations	Laura PrezMayos, Roberto Carlini, Miguel Ballesteros, Leo Wanner,TALN Research Group, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, SpainAmazon AICatalan Institute for Research and Advanced Studies ICREA, Barcelona, Spain	None	None	The adaptation of pretrained language models to solve supervised tasks has become a baseline in NLP, and many recent works have focused on studying how linguistic information is encoded in the pretrained sentence representations. Among other information, it has been shown that entire syntax trees are implicitly embedded in the geometry of such models. As these models are often fine-tuned, it becomes increasingly important to understand how the encoded knowledge evolves along the fine-tuning. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the embedded syntax trees along the fine-tuning process of BERT for six different tasks, covering all levels of the linguistic structure. Experimental results show that the encoded syntactic information is forgotten (PoS tagging), reinforced (dependency and constituency parsing) or preserved (semantics-related tasks) in different ways along the fine-tuning process depending on the task.

Moreover, we describe a representative of the second Stiefel-Whitney class by the relative trisection diagram.

In order to accurately extract the neutrino mass the source activity is required to be stable and known to a high precision. The WGTS therefore undergoes constant extensive monitoring from several measurement systems. The Forward Beam Monitor (FBM) is one such monitoring system.

 The Initial Mass Function of Low-mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the W3 Complex	Huston, Luhman	None	None	We have used archival infrared images obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope to constrain the initial mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the W3 star-forming region. The images cover 438 arcmin 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT , which encompasses the entire complex, and were taken in the filters F110W, F139M, and F160W. We have estimated extinctions for individual sources in these data from their colors and have dereddened their photometry accordingly. By comparing an area of the images that contains the richest concentration of previously identified W3 members to an area that has few members and is dominated by background stars, we have estimated the luminosity function for members of W3 with masses of 0.03‚Äì0.4 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . That luminosity function closely resembles data in typical nearby star-forming regions that have much smaller stellar populations than W3 ( ‚â≤ less-than-or-similar-to \lesssim ‚â≤ 500 vs. several thousand objects). Thus, we do not find evidence of significant variations in the initial mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with star-forming conditions, which is consistent with recent studies of other distant massive star-forming regions.

 Experimental Single-Copy Entanglement Distillation	Sebastian Ecker, Philipp Sohr, Lukas Bulla, Marcus Huber, Martin Bohmann, Rupert Ursin	sebastian.ecker@oeaw.ac.at	None	The phenomenon of entanglement marks one of the furthest departures from classical physics and is indispensable for quantum information processing. Despite its fundamental importance, the distribution of entanglement over long distances through photons is unfortunately hindered by unavoidable decoherence effects. Entanglement distillation is a means of restoring the quality of such diluted entanglement by concentrating it into a pair of qubits. Conventionally, this would be done by distributing multiple photon pairs and distilling the entanglement into a single pair. Here, we turn around this paradigm by utilising pairs of single photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom. Specifically, we make use of the polarisation and the energy-time domain of photons, both of which are extensively field-tested. We experimentally chart the domain of distillable states and achieve relative fidelity gains up to 13.8 %. Compared to the two-copy scheme, the distillation rate of our single-copy scheme is several orders of magnitude higher, paving the way towards high-capacity and noise-resilient quantum networks.

 MULTI-GROUP DISCONTINUOUS ASYMPTOTIC ùëÉ‚ÇÅ APPROXIMATION IN RADIATIVE MARSHAK WAVES EXPERIMENTS	AP Cohen, SI Heizler	avnerco@gmail.com	Department of Physics, Nuclear Research Center-Negev, P.O. Box 9001, Beer Sheva 8419001, ISRAEL	We study the propagation of radiative heat (Marshak) waves, using modified P 1 subscript ùëÉ 1 P_{1} italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -approximation equations. In relatively optically-thin media the heat propagation is supersonic, i.e. hydrodynamic motion is negligible, and thus can be described by the radiative transfer Boltzmann equation, coupled with the material energy equation. However, the exact thermal radiative transfer problem is still difficult to solve and requires massive simulation capabilities. Hence, there still exists a need for adequate approximations that are comparatively easy to carry out. Classic approximations, such as the classic diffusion and classic P 1 subscript ùëÉ 1 P_{1} italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , fail to describe the correct heat wave velocity, when the optical depth is not sufficiently high. Therefore, we use the recently developed discontinuous asymptotic P 1 subscript ùëÉ 1 P_{1} italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT approximation, which is a time-dependent analogy for the adjustment of the discontinuous asymptotic diffusion for two different zones. This approximation was tested via several benchmarks, showing better results than other common approximations, and has also demonstrated a good agreement with a main Marshak wave experiment and its Monte-Carlo gray simulation. Here we derive energy expansion of the discontinuous asymptotic P 1 subscript ùëÉ 1 P_{1} italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT approximation in slab geometry, and test it with numerous experimental results for propagating Marshak waves inside low density foams. The new approximation describes the heat wave propagation with good agreement. Furthermore, a comparison of the simulations to exact implicit Monte-Carlo slab-geometry multi-group simulations, in this wide range of experimental conditions, demonstrates the superiority of this approximation to others.

 Modeling Solar Wind Variations over an 11-yr Cycle with Alfv√©n Wave Dissipation: a Parameter Study	Soumitra Hazra, Victor Rville, Barbara Perri, Antoine Strugarek, Allan Sacha Brun, Eric Buchlin	soumitra.hazra@cea.fr, soumitra.hazra@gmail.com	None	We study the behaviour and properties of the solar wind using a 2.5D Alfv√©n wave driven wind model. We first systematically compare the results of an Alfv√©n wave (AW) driven wind model with a polytropic approach. Polytropic magnetohydrodynamic wind models are thermally driven, while Alfv√©n waves act as additional acceleration and heating mechanisms in the Alfv√©n wave driven model. We confirm that an AW-driven model is required to reproduce the observed bimodality of slow and fast solar winds. We are also able to reproduce the observed anti-correlation between the terminal wind velocity and the coronal source temperature with the AW-driven wind model. We also show that the wind properties along an eleven year cycle differ significantly from one model to the other. The AW-driven model again shows the best agreement with observational data. Indeed, solar surface magnetic field topology plays an important role in the Alfv√©n wave driven wind model, as it enters directly into the input energy sources via the Poynting flux. On the other hand, the polytropic wind model is driven by an assumed pressure gradient; thus it is relatively less sensitive to the surface magnetic field topology. Finally, we note that the net torque spinning down the Sun exhibits the same trends in the two models, showing that the polytropic approach still captures correctly the essence of stellar winds.	
 A generalization of cancellative dimer algebras to hyperbolic surfaces	Karin Baur, Charlie Beil	pmtkb@leeds.ac.uk	School of Mathematics, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom	We study a new class of quiver algebras on surfaces, called ‚Äògeodesic ghor algebras‚Äô. These algebras generalize cancellative dimer algebras on a torus to higher genus surfaces, where the relations come from perfect matchings rather than a potential. Although cancellative dimer algebras on a torus are noncommutative crepant resolutions, the center of any dimer algebra on a higher genus surface is just the polynomial ring in one variable, and so the center and surface are unrelated. In contrast, we establish a rich interplay between the central geometry of geodesic ghor algebras and the topology of the surface in which they are embedded. Furthermore, we show that noetherian central localizations of such algebras are endomorphism rings of modules over their centers.	
 State estimation with limited sensors ‚Äì A deep learning based approach	Yash KumarDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringDelhi Technological UniversityShahbad Daulatpur, Main Bawana Road, Delhi, IndiaPranav BahlDepartment of Mechanical EngineeringDelhi Technological UniversityShahbad Daulatpur, Main Bawana Road, Delhi, IndiaSouvik ChakrabortyDepartment of Applied MechanicsIndian Institute of Technology DelhiHauz Khas , New Delhi, India	None	None	The importance of state estimation in fluid mechanics is well-established; it is required for accomplishing several tasks, including design/optimization, active control, and future state prediction. A common tactic in this regard is to rely on reduced-order models. Such approaches, in general, use measurement data of a one-time instance. However, often data available from sensors is sequential, and ignoring it results in information loss. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based state estimation framework that learns from sequential data. The proposed model structure consists of the recurrent cell to pass information from different time steps, enabling this information to recover the full state. We illustrate that utilizing sequential data allows for state recovery from minimal and noisy sensor measurements. For efficient recovery of the state, the proposed approach is coupled with an auto-encoder based reduced-order model. We illustrate the performance of the proposed approach using three examples, and it is found to outperform other alternatives existing in the literature.	
 Polynomial Time ùëò-Shortest Multi-Criteria Prioritized and All-Criteria-Disjoint Paths	Yefim Dinitz, Shlomi Dolev, Manish Kumar	None	None	The shortest secure path (routing) problem in communication networks has to deal with multiple attack layers e.g., man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, packet injection, packet insertion, etc. Consider different probabilities for each such attack over an edge, probabilities that can differ across edges. Furthermore, a usage of a single shortest paths (for routing) implies possible traffic bottleneck, which should be avoided if possible, which we term pathneck security avoidance . Finding all Pareto‚Äìoptimal solutions for the multi-criteria single-source single-destination shortest secure path problem with non-negative edge lengths might yield a solution with an exponential number of paths. In the first part of this paper, we study specific settings of the multi-criteria shortest secure path problem, which are based on prioritized multi-criteria and on k ùëò k italic_k -shortest secure paths. In the second part, we show a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an undirected graph G ùê∫ G italic_G and a pair of vertices ( s , t ) ùë† ùë° (s,t) ( italic_s , italic_t ) , finds prioritized multi-criteria 2 2 2 2 -disjoint (vertex/edge) shortest secure paths between s ùë† s italic_s and t ùë° t italic_t .

 Numerical simulation of the viral entry into a cell driven by receptor diffusion	Wiegold,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Sandra KlingestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, GilbertstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Holzapfel,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The present study focuses on the receptor driven endocytosis typical of viral entry into a cell. A locally increased density of receptors at the time of contact between the cell and the virus is necessary in this case. The virus is considered as a substrate with fixed receptors on its surface, whereas the receptors of the host cell are free to move over its membrane, allowing a local change in their concentration. In the contact zone the membrane inflects and forms an envelope around the virus. The created vesicle imports its cargo into the cell. This paper assumes the diffusion equation accompanied by boundary conditions requiring the conservation of binders to describe the process. Moreover, it introduces a condition defining the energy balance at the front of the adhesion zone. The latter yields the upper limit for the size of virus which can be engulfed by the cell membrane. The described moving boundary problem in terms of the binder density and the velocity of the adhesion front is well posed and numerically solved by using the finite difference method. The illustrative examples have been chosen to show the influence of the process parameters on the initiation and the duration of the process.

 Investigating Bi-Level Optimization for Learning and Vision from a Unified Perspective: A Survey and Beyond	RishengLiu,JiaxinGao,JinZhang,DeyuMeng,andZhouchenLin	None	None	Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) is originated from the area of economic game theory and then introduced into the optimization community. BLO is able to handle problems with a hierarchical structure, involving two levels of optimization tasks, where one task is nested inside the other. In machine learning and computer vision fields, despite the different motivations and mechanisms, a lot of complex problems, such as hyper-parameter optimization, multi-task and meta learning, neural architecture search, adversarial learning and deep reinforcement learning, actually all contain a series of closely related subproblms. In this paper, we first uniformly express these complex learning and vision problems from the perspective of BLO. Then we construct a best-response-based single-level reformulation and establish a unified algorithmic framework to understand and formulate mainstream gradient-based BLO methodologies, covering aspects ranging from fundamental automatic differentiation schemes to various accelerations, simplifications, extensions and their convergence and complexity properties. Last but not least, we discuss the potentials of our unified BLO framework for designing new algorithms and point out some promising directions for future research.	
 Classification problem of simple Hom-Lie algebras	Youness El Kharraf	yns.elkharraf@gmail.com	Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Moulay Ismail, P.O. 11201 Zitoune, Meknes, Morocco	First, we construct some families of nonsolvable anticommutative algebras, solvable Lie algebras and even nilpotent Lie algebras, that can be endowed with the structure of a simple Hom-Lie algebra. This situation shows that a classification of simple Hom-Lie algebras would be unrealistic without any further restrictions. We introduce the class of strongly simple Hom-Lie algebras , as the class of anticommutative algebras that are simple Hom-Lie with respect to all their twisting maps. We show some of its properties, provide a characterization and explore some of its subclasses. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of regular simple Hom-Lie algebras over any arbitrary field, together with a description of a lower bound of the number of their isomorphism classes, which depends entirely on the finiteness or not of the underlying field. In addition, we establish that every simple anticommutative algebra of dimension 3 3 3 3 turns out to be the outside Yau‚Äôs twist of the special orthogonal Lie algebra ùî∞ ùî¨ ( 3 , ùîΩ ) ùî∞ ùî¨ 3 ùîΩ \mathfrak{so}(3,\mathbb{F}) fraktur_s fraktur_o ( 3 , blackboard_F ) with respect to some bijective linear map. Also, we determine all the simple Hom-Lie algebras of dimension 2 2 2 2 , up to conjugacy, which were wrongly claimed to be nonexistent in previous literature. Finally, we establish a new simplicity criterion for Lie algebras, which as an application shows that the simplicity in the category of multiplicative Hom-Lie algebras is equivalent to that of anticommutative algebras.	
 Pregeometry and spontaneous time-space asymmetry	Wetterich	None	None	In pregeometry a metric arises as a composite object at large distances. We investigate if its signature, which distinguishes between time and space, could be a result of the dynamics rather than being built in already in the formulation of a model. For short distances we formulate our model as a Yang-Mills theory with fermions and vector fields. For the local gauge symmetry we take the non-compact group SO(4, ‚ÑÇ ‚ÑÇ \mathbb{C} blackboard_C ). The particular representation of the vector field permits us to implement diffeomorphism invariant kinetic terms. Geometry and general relativity emerge at large distances due to a spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry which induces masses for the gauge bosons. The difference between time and space arises directly from this spontaneous symmetry breaking. For a euclidean metric all fields have a standard propagator at high momenta. Analytic continuation to a Minkowski-metric is achieved by a change of field values. We conjecture that this type of model could be consistent with unitarity and well behaved in the short distance limit.	
 Supervised Tree-Wasserstein Distance	Yuki Takezawa, Ryoma Sato, Makoto Yamada	None	None	To measure the similarity of documents, the Wasserstein distance is a powerful tool, but it requires a high computational cost. Recently, for fast computation of the Wasserstein distance, methods for approximating the Wasserstein distance using a tree metric have been proposed. These tree-based methods allow fast comparisons of a large number of documents; however, they are unsupervised and do not learn task-specific distances. In this work, we propose the Supervised Tree-Wasserstein (STW) distance, a fast, supervised metric learning method based on the tree metric. Specifically, we rewrite the Wasserstein distance on the tree metric by the parent‚Äìchild relationships of a tree, and formulate it as a continuous optimization problem using a contrastive loss. Experimentally, we show that the STW distance can be computed fast, and improves the accuracy of document classification tasks. Furthermore, the STW distance is formulated by matrix multiplications, runs on a GPU, and is suitable for batch processing. Therefore, we show that the STW distance is extremely efficient when comparing a large number of documents.

 Improving Graph Representation Learning by Contrastive Regularization	Kaili Ma, Haochen Yang, Han Yang, Tatiana Jin, Pengfei Chen, Yongqiang Chen, Barakeel Fanseu Kamhoua, James Cheng	klma, hyang, tjin, pfchen, yqchen, kamhoua, jcheng@cse.cuhk.edu.hk,yanghaochengary@gmail.com	None	Graph representation learning is an important task with applications in various areas such as online social networks, e-commerce networks, WWW and semantic webs. For unsupervised graph representation learning, many algorithms such as Node2Vec and GraphSAGE make use of ‚Äúnegative sampling‚Äù and/or noise contrastive estimation loss. This bears similar ideas to contrastive learning, which ‚Äúcontrasts‚Äù the node representation similarities of semantically similar (positive) pairs against those of negative pairs. However, despite the success of contrastive learning, we found that directly applying this technique to graph representation learning models (e.g., graph convolutional networks) does not always work. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance and propose a light-weight regularization term that avoids the high scales of node representations‚Äô norms and the high variance among them to improve the generalization performance. Our experimental results further validate that this regularization term significantly improves the representation quality across different node similarity definitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	
 Time to revisit the endpoint dilution assay and to replace \tcid and \pfu as measures of a virus sample‚Äôs infection concentration	Daniel Cresta, Donald CWarren, Christian Quirouette, Amanda PSmith, Lindey CLane, Amber MSmith, Catherine AABeauchemin	None	None	The infectivity of a virus sample is measured by the infections it causes, via a plaque or focus forming assay ( \pfu or FFU) or an endpoint dilution (ED) assay ( \tcid , CCID 50 50 {}_{50} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 50 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , EID 50 50 {}_{50} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 50 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT , etc., hereafter collectively ID 50 subscript ID 50 \text{ID}_{50} ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 50 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). The counting of plaques or foci at a given dilution intuitively and directly provides the concentration of infectious doses in the undiluted sample. However, it has many technical and experimental limitations. For example, it is subjective as it relies on one‚Äôs judgement in distinguishing between two merged plaques and a larger one, or between small plaques and staining artifacts. In this regard, ED assays are more robust because one need only determine whether or not infection occurred. The output of the ED assay, the 50% infectious dose ( ID 50 subscript ID 50 \text{ID}_{50} ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 50 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), is calculated using either the Spearman-K√§rber (1908|1931) or Reed-Muench (1938) mathematical approximations. However, these are often miscalculated and their approximation of the ID 50 subscript ID 50 \text{ID}_{50} ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 50 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT cannot be reliably related to the infectious dose. Herein, we propose that the plaque and focus forming assays be abandoned, and that the measured output of the ED assay, the ID 50 subscript ID 50 \text{ID}_{50} ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 50 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , be replaced by a more useful measure we coined specific infections ( \idnew ). We introduce a free, open-source web-application, midSIN , that computes the \idnew concentration in a virus sample from a standard ED assay, requiring no changes to current experimental protocols. We use midSIN to analyze sets of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus samples, and demonstrate that the \idnew /mL of a sample reliably corresponds to the number of infections a sample will cause per unit volume. The \idnew /mL concentration of a virus sample estimated by midSIN , unlike the ID 50 subscript ID 50 \text{ID}_{50} ID start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 50 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT /mL, can be used directly to achieve the desired multiplicity of infection. Estimates obtained with midSIN are shown to be more accurate and robust than those obtained using the Reed-Muench and Spearman-K√§rber approximations. The impact of ED plate design choices (dilution factor, replicates per dilution) on measurement accuracy is also explored. The simplicity of \idnew as a measure and the greater accuracy provided by midSIN make them an easy and superior replacement for the \pfu , FFU, \tcid and other ID 50 50 {}_{50} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 50 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT measures. We hope to see their universal adoption to measure the infectivity of virus samples.	
 Ergodicity breaking in area-restricted search of avian predators	Ohad Vilka,b,ca,b,cstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica , italicb , italicc endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Yotam Orchanb,cb,cstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb , italicc endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Motti Charterb,c,db,c,dstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb , italicc , italicd endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Nadav Ganotb,cb,cstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb , italicc endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Sivan Toledoc,ec,estartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicc , italice endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ran Nathanb,cb,cstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb , italicc endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Michael AssafaastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	ohad.vilk@mail.huji.ac.il	None	Quantifying and comparing patterns of dynamical ecological systems require averaging over measurable quantities. For example, to infer variation in movement and behavior, metrics such as step length and velocity are averaged over large ensembles. Yet, in nonergodic systems such averaging is inconsistent; thus, identifying ergodicity breaking is essential in ecology. Using rich high-resolution movement datasets ( > 7 √ó 10 7 absent 7 superscript 10 7 >\!7\times 10^{7} > 7 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT localizations) from 70 individuals and continuous-time random walk modeling, we find subdiffusive behavior and ergodicity breaking in the localized movement of three species of avian predators. Small-scale, within-patch movement was found to be qualitatively different, not inferrable and separated from large-scale inter-patch movement. Local search is characterized by long power-law-distributed waiting times with diverging mean, giving rise to ergodicity breaking in the form of considerable variability uniquely observed at this scale. This implies that wild animal movement is scale specific with no typical waiting time at the local scale.	
 Detection of electron spin resonance down to 10 K using localized spoof surface plasmon	Subhadip Roy, Anuvab Nandi, Pronoy Das, Chiranjib Mitra	None	None	In this study, novel use of the electromagnetic field profile of a localized spoof surface plasmonic mode to detect electron spin resonance is being reported. The mode is supported on a resonator with a complementary metallic spiral structure, etched on the ground plane of a microstrip line having a characteristic impedance of 50 Œ© Œ© \Omega roman_Œ© . The change in characteristics of the mode of interest with lowering of temperature has been observed and analyzed. Electron spin resonance spectra of a standard paramagnetic sample, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, are recorded using this resonator down to 10 K. Potential application of the mode in the detection of microwave Rashba field-driven electron spin resonance has been discussed.	
 NTU-X: An Enhanced Large-scale Dataset for Improving Pose-based Recognition of Subtle Human Actions	Neel Trivedi, Anirudh Thatipelli, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla	neel.trivedi@research.iiit.ac.in	None	The lack of fine-grained joints (facial joints, hand fingers) is a fundamental performance bottleneck for state of the art skeleton action recognition models. Despite this bottleneck, community‚Äôs efforts seem to be invested only in coming up with novel architectures. To specifically address this bottleneck, we introduce two new pose based human action datasets - NTU60-X and NTU120-X. Our datasets extend the largest existing action recognition dataset, NTU-RGBD. In addition to the 25 body joints for each skeleton as in NTU-RGBD, NTU60-X and NTU120-X dataset includes finger and facial joints, enabling a richer skeleton representation. We appropriately modify the state of the art approaches to enable training using the introduced datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these NTU-X datasets in overcoming the aforementioned bottleneck and improve state of the art performance, overall and on previously worst performing action categories. Code and pretrained models can be found at https://github.com/skelemoa/ntu-x .	
 SYNTACTICALLY GUIDED GENERATIVE EMBEDDINGS FOR ZERO-SHOT SKELETON ACTION RECOGNITION			None	We introduce SynSE, a novel syntactically guided generative approach for Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). Our end-to-end approach learns progressively refined generative embedding spaces constrained within and across the involved modalities (visual, language). The inter-modal constraints are defined between action sequence embedding and embeddings of Parts of Speech (PoS) tagged words in the corresponding action description. We deploy SynSE for the task of skeleton-based action sequence recognition. Our design choices enable SynSE to generalize compositionally, i.e., recognize sequences whose action descriptions contain words not encountered during training. We also extend our approach to the more challenging Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem via a confidence-based gating mechanism. We are the first to present zero-shot skeleton action recognition results on the large-scale NTU-60 and NTU-120 skeleton action datasets with multiple splits. Our results demonstrate SynSE‚Äôs state of the art performance in both ZSL and GZSL settings compared to strong baselines on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets.	
 Tropical Support Vector Machines: Evaluations and Extension to Function Spaces	Ruriko Yoshida, Misaki Takamori, Hideyuki Matsumoto, Keiji Miura	None	None	Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular supervised learning models to classify using a hyperplane in an Euclidean space. Similar to SVMs, tropical SVMs classify data points using a tropical hyperplane under the tropical metric with the max-plus algebra. In this paper, first we show generalization error bounds of tropical SVMs over the tropical projective torus. While the generalization error bounds attained via Vapnik-Chervonenkis ( VC ) dimensions in a distribution-free manner still depend on the dimension, we also show numerically and theoretically by extreme value statistics that the tropical SVMs for classifying data points from two Gaussian distributions as well as empirical data sets of different neuron types are fairly robust against the curse of dimensionality. Extreme value statistics also underlie the anomalous scaling behaviors of the tropical distance between random vectors with additional noise dimensions. Finally, we define tropical SVMs over a function space with the tropical metric.	
 A Characterization for Optimal Bundling of Products with Non-Additive Values	Soheil GhiliYale University	None	None	This paper studies optimal bundling of products with non-additive values. Under monotonic preferences and single-peaked profits, I show a monopolist finds pure bundling optimal if and only if the optimal sales volume for the grand bundle is larger than the optimal sales volume for any smaller bundle. I then (i) detail how my analysis relates to ‚Äúratio monotonicity‚Äù results on bundling; and (ii) describe the implications for non-linear pricing.	
 Periodic seismicity detection without declustering	TimothyPark, FranzJKiraly, StephenJBourne	None	None	Any periodic variations of earthquake occurrence rates in response to small, known, periodic stress variations provide important opportunities to learn about the earthquake nucleation process. Yet, reliable detection of earthquake periodicity is complicated by the presence of earthquake clustering due to aftershocks and foreshocks. Existing methods for detecting periodicity in an earthquake catalogue typically require the prior removal of these clustered events. Declustering is a highly uncertain process, so declustering methods are inherently non-unique. Incorrect declustering may remove some independent events, or fail to remove some aftershocks or foreshocks, or both. These two types of error could respectively lead to false negative or false positive reporting of periodic seismicity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method for detecting earthquake periodicity that does not require declustering. Our approach is to modify the existing Schuster Spectrum Test (SST) by adapting a test statistic for periodic seismicity to account for the presence of clustered earthquakes within the catalogue without requiring their identification and removal.	
 A rotational and vibrational investigation of phenylpropiolonitrile (\ceC6H5C3N)	Zachary Buchanan, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Olivia Chitarra, Michael McCarthy, Olivier Pirali, MarieAline MartinDrumel	None	Universit√© Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Institut des Sciences Mol√©culaires d‚ÄôOrsay, 91405 Orsay, France	The evidence for benzonitrile ( \ce C6H5CN) in the starless cloud core TMC‚Äì1 makes high-resolution studies of other aromatic nitriles and their ring-chain derivatives especially timely. One such species is phenylpropiolonitrile (3-phenyl-2-propynenitrile, \ce C6H5C3N), whose spectroscopic characterization is reported here for the first time. The low resolution (0.5 cm ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ) vibrational spectrum of \ce C6H5C3N has been recorded at far- and mid-infrared wavelengths (50‚Äì3500 cm ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ) using a Fourier Transform interferometer, allowing for the assignment of band centers of 14 fundamental vibrational bands. The pure rotational spectrum of the species has been investigated using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectrometer (6‚Äì18 GHz), a cavity enhanced FTMW instrument (6‚Äì20 GHz), and a millimeter-wave one (75‚Äì100 GHz, 140‚Äì214 GHz). Through the assignment of more than 6200 lines, accurate ground state spectroscopic constants (rotational, centrifugal distortion up to octics, and nuclear quadrupole hyperfine constants) have been derived from our measurements, with a plausible prediction of the weaker bands through calculations. Interstellar searches for this highly polar species can now be undertaken with confidence since the astronomically most interesting radio lines have either been measured or can be calculated to very high accuracy below 300 GHz.

 Tractable higher-order under-approximating AE extensions for non-linear systems	Eric Goubault, Sylvie Putot	None	LIX, CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France (email: author@lix.polytechnique.fr)	We consider the problem of under and over-approximating the image of general vector-valued functions over bounded sets, and apply the proposed solution to the estimation of reachable sets of uncertain non-linear discrete-time dynamical systems. Such a combination of under and over-approximations is very valuable for the verification of properties of embedded and cyber-physical controlled systems. Over-approximations prove properties correct, while under-approximations can be used for falsification. Coupled, they provide a measure of the conservatism of the analysis. This work introduces a general framework relying on computations of robust ranges of vector-valued functions. This framework allows us to extend for under-approximation many precision refinements that are classically used for over-approximations, such as affine approximations, Taylor models, quadrature formulae and preconditioning methods. We end by evaluating the efficiency and precision of our approach, focusing on the application to the analysis of discrete-time dynamical systems with inputs and disturbances, on different examples from the literature.

 Multi-agent simulation of voter‚Äôs behaviour	Albin Soutif Carole Adam Sylvain BouveretUniv GrenobleAlpes, Grenoble Informatics Laboratory	None	None	The goal of this paper is to simulate the voters‚Äô behaviour given a voting method.

Here we only tried basic rules and a single voting method, but further attempts could explore new features.	
 Autoencoder-based Condition Monitoring and Anomaly Detection Method for Rotating Machines	Sabtain Ahmad,Kevin StypRekowski,Sasho Nedelkoski,Odej Kao	None	None	Rotating machines like engines, pumps, or turbines are ubiquitous in modern day societies. Their mechanical parts such as electrical engines, rotors, or bearings are the major components and any failure in them may result in their total shutdown. Anomaly detection in such critical systems is very important to monitor the system‚Äôs health. As the requirement to obtain a dataset from rotating machines where all possible faults are explicitly labeled is difficult to satisfy, we propose a method that focuses on the normal behavior of the machine instead. We propose an autoencoder model-based method for condition monitoring of rotating machines by using an anomaly detection approach. The method learns the characteristics of a rotating machine using the normal vibration signals to model the healthy state of the machine. A threshold-based approach is then applied to the reconstruction error of unseen data, thus enabling the detection of unseen anomalies. The proposed method can directly extract the salient features from raw vibration signals and eliminate the need for manually engineered features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by employing two rotating machine datasets and the quality of the automatically learned features is compared with a set of handcrafted features by training an Isolation Forest model on either of these two sets. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed solution gives promising results, achieving an average F1-score of 99.6%.

Based on the cumulative flux distribution of the Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray lightcurve, we identified four distinct activity states and noticed an increase in the baseline flux during the first three states. Similar nature of the increase in the average flux was also noticed in X-ray and UV bands. A large flaring activity in Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -rays was noticed in the fourth state. The source was observed twice by AstroSat for shorter intervals ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº days) during the longer observing periods ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº years) state 3 and 4. During AstroSat observing periods, the source Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray flux was higher than the average flux observed during longer duration states. The increase in the average baseline flux from state 1 to state 3 can be explained considering a corresponding increase of jet particle normalisation. The inverse Comptonisation of synchrotron photons explained the average X-ray and Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray emission by jet electrons during the first three longer duration states. However, during the shorter duration AstroSat observing periods, a shift of the synchrotron peak frequency was noticed, and the synchrotron emission of jet electrons well explained the observed X-ray flux.	
 Partial GVZ-groups	Shawn Burkett, Mark Lewis	sburkett@math.kent.edu	"Department of Mathematical Sciences, Kent State University, Kent,
Ohio 44242, U.S.A."	Following the literature, a group G ùê∫ G italic_G is called a group of central type if G ùê∫ G italic_G has an irreducible character that vanishes on G ‚àñ Z ( G ) ùê∫ ùëç ùê∫ G\setminus Z(G) italic_G ‚àñ italic_Z ( italic_G ) . Motivated by this definition, we say that a character œá ‚àà Irr ( G ) ùúí Irr ùê∫ \chi\in{\rm Irr}(G) italic_œá ‚àà roman_Irr ( italic_G ) has central type if œá ùúí \chi italic_œá vanishes on G ‚àñ Z ( œá ) ùê∫ ùëç ùúí G\setminus Z(\chi) italic_G ‚àñ italic_Z ( italic_œá ) , where Z ( œá ) ùëç ùúí Z(\chi) italic_Z ( italic_œá ) is the center of œá ùúí \chi italic_œá . Groups where every irreducible character has central type have been studied previously under the name GVZ-groups (and several other names) in the literature. In this paper, we study the groups G ùê∫ G italic_G that possess a nontrivial, normal subgroup N ùëÅ N italic_N such that every character of G ùê∫ G italic_G either contains N ùëÅ N italic_N in its kernel or has central type. The structure of these groups is surprisingly limited and has many aspects in common with both central type groups and GVZ-groups.

 Linear Polarization of the 21 cm Line from the Epoch of Reionization	Bohua Li, Jianrong Tan, Yi Mao	None	None	The 21 cm linear polarization due to Thomson scattering off free electrons can probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization, complementary to the 21 cm temperature fluctuations. Previous study ( 2005ApJ...635....1B ) estimated the strength of polarization with a toy model and claimed that it can be detected with 1-month observation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Here we revisit this investigation with account of nonlinear terms due to inhomogeneous reionization, using seminumerical reionization simulations to provide the realistic estimation of the 21 cm TE and EE angular power spectra ( C ‚Ñì TE subscript superscript ùê∂ TE ‚Ñì C^{\rm TE}_{\ell} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_TE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and C ‚Ñì EE subscript superscript ùê∂ EE ‚Ñì C^{\rm EE}_{\ell} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_EE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). We find that (1) both power spectra are enhanced on sub-bubble scales but suppressed on super-bubble scales, compared with previous results; (2) C ‚Ñì TE subscript superscript ùê∂ TE ‚Ñì C^{\rm TE}_{\ell} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_TE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì end_POSTSUBSCRIPT displays a zero-crossing at ‚Ñì < 100 ‚Ñì 100 \ell<100 roman_‚Ñì < 100 , and its angular scale is sensitive to the scale-dependence of H I bias on large scales; (3) the ratios of the power spectrum to its maximum value during reionization at a given ‚Ñì ‚Ñì \ell roman_‚Ñì , i.e. C ‚Ñì TE / C ‚Ñì , max TE subscript superscript ùê∂ TE ‚Ñì subscript superscript ùê∂ TE ‚Ñì max C^{\rm TE}_{\ell}/C^{\rm TE}_{\ell,{\rm max}} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_TE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_TE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì , roman_max end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and C ‚Ñì EE / C ‚Ñì , max EE subscript superscript ùê∂ EE ‚Ñì subscript superscript ùê∂ EE ‚Ñì max C^{\rm EE}_{\ell}/C^{\rm EE}_{\ell,{\rm max}} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_EE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_EE end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì , roman_max end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , show robust correlations with the global ionized fraction. However, measurement of this signal will be very challenging not only because the overall strength is weaker than the sensitivity of SKA, but also because of the polarized foregrounds from diffuse synchrotron emission, and Faraday rotation which modifies the observed polarization. Nevertheless, the 21 cm linear polarization signal may still likely be detectable through other approaches, e.g. its cross-correlation with other probes.	
 Super-Resolution for Doubly-Dispersive Channel Estimation	Robert BeinertPeter JungGabriele SteidlTom Szollmann	None	None	In this work we consider the problem of identification and reconstruction of doubly-dispersive channel operators which are given by finite linear combinations of time-frequency shifts. Such operators arise as time-varying linear systems for example in radar and wireless communications. In particular, for information transmission in highly non-stationary environments the channel needs to be estimated quickly with identification signals of short duration and for vehicular application simultaneous high-resolution radar is desired as well. We consider the time-continuous setting and prove an exact resampling reformulation of the involved channel operator when applied to a trigonometric polynomial as identifier in terms of sparse linear combinations of real-valued atoms. Motivated by recent works of Heckel et al. we present an exact approach for off-the-grid superresolution which allows to perform the identification with realizable signals having compact support. Then we show how an alternating descent conditional gradient algorithm can be adapted to solve the reformulated problem. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of this algorithm, in particular in comparison with a simple adaptive grid refinement strategy and an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm.

 Sum Uncertainty Relations: Uncertainty Regions for Qubits and Qutrits	Seeta Vasudevrao, Reena, Sudha, RUsha Devi, Rajagopal	None	None	We investigate the notion of uncertainty region using the variance based sum uncertainty relation for qubits and qutrits. We compare uncertainty region of the qubit (a 2-level system) with that of the qutrit (3-level system) by considering sum uncertainty relation for two non-commuting Pauli-like observables, acting on the two dimensional qubit Hilbert space. We identify that physically valid uncertainty region of a qubit is smaller than that of a qutrit. This implies that an enhanced precision can be achieved in the measurement of incompatible Pauli-like observables acting on the 2-dimensional subspace of a qutrit Hilbert space. We discuss the implication of the reduced uncertainties in the steady states of Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ , V, Œû Œû \Xi roman_Œû types of 3-level atomic systems. Furthermore, we construct a two-qubit permutation symmetric state, corresponding to a 3-level system and show that the reduction in the sum uncertainty value - or equivalently, increased uncertainty region of a qutrit system ‚Äì is a consequence of quantum entanglement in the two-qubit system. Our results suggest that uncertainty region can be used as a dimensional witness.	
 Homological mirror symmetry for elliptic Hopf Surfaces	Abigail Ward	None	None	We show homological mirror symmetry results relating coherent analytic sheaves on some complex elliptic surfaces and objects of certain Fukaya categories. We first define the notion of a non-algebraic Landau-Ginzburg model on ‚Ñù √ó ( S 1 ) 3 ‚Ñù superscript superscript ùëÜ 1 3 \mathbb{R}\times\left(S^{1}\right)^{3} blackboard_R √ó ( italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and its associated Fukaya category, and show that non-K√§hler surfaces obtained by performing two logarithmic transformations to the product of the projective plane and an elliptic curve have non-algebraic Landau-Ginzburg models as their mirror spaces; this class of surface includes the classical Hopf surface S 1 √ó S 3 superscript ùëÜ 1 superscript ùëÜ 3 S^{1}\times S^{3} italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT √ó italic_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and other elliptic primary and secondary Hopf surfaces. We also define localization maps from the Fukaya categories associated to the Landau-Ginzburg models to partially wrapped and fully wrapped categories. We show mirror symmetry results that relate the partially wrapped and fully wrapped categories to spaces of coherent analytic sheaves on open submanifolds of the compact complex surfaces in question, and we use these results to sketch a proof of a full HMS result.

 Modelling the Impact of Scandals: the case of the 2017 French Presidential Election	Yassine Bouachrine and Carole Adam	None	None	This paper proposes an agent-based simulation of a presidential election, inspired by the French 2017 presidential election. The simulation is based on data extracted from polls, media coverage, and Twitter. The main contribution is to consider the impact of scandals and media bashing on the result of the election. In particular, it is shown that scandals can lead to higher abstention at the election, as voters have no relevant candidate left to vote for. The simulation is implemented in Unity 3D and is available to play online. Keywords: agent-based simulation, computational social choice, voting models

 Current and Emergent Economic Impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK Fresh Produce and Horticultural Businesses	Lilian Korir, Archie Drake, Martin Collison, Tania Carolina CamachoVilla, Elizabeth Sklar,, Simon Pearson	None	None	This paper describes a study designed to investigate the current and emergent impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK horticultural businesses. Various characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into 2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather information from a relatively small ( n = 19 ùëõ 19 n=19 italic_n = 19 ) but indicative group of producers. The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry (89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option (32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently, automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK‚Äôs horticultural workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points for the research community.

The kernel libraries consist of infrastructures for building efficient GNNs, including graph data structures, graph map-reduce framework, graph mini-batch strategy, etc. These infrastructures enable tf_geometric to support single-graph computation, multi-graph computation, graph mini-batch, distributed training, etc.; therefore, tf_geometric can be used for a variety of graph deep learning tasks, such as transductive node classification, inductive node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Based on the kernel libraries, tf_geometric implements a variety of popular GNN models for different tasks. To facilitate the implementation of GNNs, tf_geometric also provides some other libraries for dataset management, graph sampling, etc. Different from existing popular GNN libraries, tf_geometric provides not only Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) APIs, but also Functional APIs, which enable tf_geometric to handle advanced graph deep learning tasks such as graph meta-learning. The APIs of tf_geometric are friendly, and they are suitable for both beginners and experts. In this paper, we first present an overview of tf_geometric‚Äôs framework. Then, we conduct experiments on some benchmark datasets and report the performance of several popular GNN models implemented by tf_geometric.	
 Signatures of Liouvillian exceptional points in a quantum thermal machine	Shishir Khandelwal, Nicolas Brunner and Graldine Haack	geraldine.haack@unige.ch	None	Viewing a quantum thermal machine as a non-Hermitian quantum system, we characterize in full generality its analytical time-dependent dynamics by deriving the spectrum of its non-Hermitian Liouvillian for an arbitrary initial state. We show that the thermal machine features a number of Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs) for experimentally realistic parameters, in particular a third-order exceptional point that leaves signatures both in short and long-time regimes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this EP corresponds to a regime of critical decay for the quantum thermal machine towards its steady state, bearing a striking resemblance with a critically damped harmonic oscillator. These results open up exciting possibilities for the precise dynamical control of quantum thermal machines exploiting exceptional points from non-Hermitian physics and are amenable to state-of-the-art solid-state platforms such as semiconducting and superconducting devices.	
 1 Introduction			None	In the present paper we discuss about a set of geometric and physical properties of hyper-generalised quasi-Einstein spacetime. At the beginning we discuss about pseudosymmetry over a hyper-generalised quasi-Einstein spacetime. Here we discuss about W 2 subscript ùëä 2 W_{2} italic_W start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT -Ricci pseudosymmetry, Z ùëç Z italic_Z -Ricci pseudosymmetry, Ricci pseudosymmetry and projective pseudosymmetry over a hyper-generalised quasi-Einstein spacetime. Later on we take over Ricci symmetric hyper-generalised quasi-Einstein spacetime and derive a set of important geometric and physical theorems over it. Moving further we consider some physical applications of the hyper-generalised quasi-Einstein spacetime. Lastly we prove the existence of a hyper-generalised quasi-Einstein spacetime by constructing a non-trivial example.

 Powering COVID-19 community Q&A with Curated Side Information	Manisha Verma, Kapil Thadani, and Shaunak Mishra	manishav,thadani,shaunakm@verizonmedia.com	None	Community question answering and discussion platforms such as Reddit, Yahoo! answers or Quora provide users the flexibility of asking open ended questions to a large audience, and replies to such questions maybe useful both to the user and the community on certain topics such as health, sports or finance. Given the recent events around COVID-19, some of these platforms have attracted 2000+ questions from users about several aspects associated with the disease. Given the impact of this disease on general public, in this work we investigate ways to improve the ranking of user generated answers on COVID-19. We specifically explore the utility of external technical sources of side information (such as CDC guidelines or WHO FAQs) in improving answer ranking on such platforms. We found that ranking user answers based on question-answer similarity is not sufficient, and existing models cannot effectively exploit external (side) information. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different attention based neural models that can directly exploit side information available in technical documents or verified forums (e.g., research publications on COVID-19 or WHO website). Augmented with a temperature mechanism, the attention based neural models can selectively determine the relevance of side information for a given user question, while ranking answers.

We focus on the case where the Hessian is not definite at x ‚ãÜ superscript ùë• ‚ãÜ x^{\star} italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . We assume instead that the minimum is strictly polynomial and give a higher order nested expansion of f ùëì f italic_f at x ‚ãÜ superscript ùë• ‚ãÜ x^{\star} italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , which depends on every coordinate.

However, we prove that the case where the order is 10 10 10 10 or higher is fundamentally different and that further assumptions are needed. We then give the rate of convergence of Gibbs measures using this expansion. Finally we adapt our results to the multiple well case.	
 Gain distance matrices for complex unit gain graphs	Aniruddha Samanta, Rajesh Kannan	None	None	A complex unit gain graph ( ùïã ùïã \mathbb{T} blackboard_T -gain graph), Œ¶ = ( G , œÜ ) Œ¶ ùê∫ ùúë \Phi=(G,\varphi) roman_Œ¶ = ( italic_G , italic_œÜ ) is a graph where the function œÜ ùúë \varphi italic_œÜ assigns a unit complex number to each orientation of an edge of G ùê∫ G italic_G , and its inverse is assigned to the opposite orientation. In this article, we propose gain distance matrices for ùïã ùïã \mathbb{T} blackboard_T -gain graphs. These notions generalize the corresponding known concepts of distance matrices and signed distance matrices. Shahul K. Hameed et al. introduced signed distance matrices and developed their properties. Motivated by their work, we establish several spectral properties, including some equivalences between balanced ùïã ùïã \mathbb{T} blackboard_T -gain graphs and gain distance matrices. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of positively weighted ùïã ùïã \mathbb{T} blackboard_T -gain graphs and study some of their properties. Using these properties, Acharya‚Äôs and Staniƒá‚Äôs spectral criteria for balance are deduced. Moreover, the notions of order independence and distance compatibility are studied. Besides, we obtain some characterizations for distance compatibility.	
 A Neighborhood-preserving Graph Summarization	Abd Errahmane KIOUCHE, Julien BASTE, Mohammed HADDAD, Hamida SEBA	None	None	We introduce in this paper a new summarization method for large graphs. Our summarization approach retains only a user-specified proportion of the neighbors of each node in the graph. Our main aim is to simplify large graphs so that they can be analyzed and processed effectively while preserving as many of the node neighborhood properties as possible. Since many graph algorithms are based on the neighborhood information available for each node, the idea is to produce a smaller graph which can be used to allow these algorithms to handle large graphs and run faster while providing good approximations. Moreover, our compression allows users to control the size of the compressed graph by adjusting the amount of information loss that can be tolerated. The experiments conducted on various real and synthetic graphs show that our compression reduces considerably the size of the graphs. Moreover, we conducted several experiments on the obtained summaries using various graph algorithms and applications, such as node embedding, graph classification and shortest path approximations. The obtained results show interesting trade-offs between the algorithms runtime speed-up and the precision loss.	
 Wisdom of the Contexts: Active Ensemble Learning for Contextual Anomaly Detection	Ece Calikus, Sawomir Nowaczyk, MohamedRafik Bouguelia, Onur Dikmen	None	None	In contextual anomaly detection, an object is only considered anomalous within a specific context. Most existing methods use a single context based on a set of user-specified contextual features. However, identifying the right context can be very challenging in practice, especially in datasets with a large number of attributes. Furthermore, in real-world systems, there might be multiple anomalies that occur in different contexts and, therefore, require a combination of several ‚Äúuseful‚Äù contexts to unveil them. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called WisCon (Wisdom of the Contexts), to effectively detect complex contextual anomalies in situations where the true contextual and behavioral attributes are unknown. Our method constructs an ensemble of multiple contexts, with varying importance scores, based on the assumption that not all useful contexts are equally so. We estimate the importance of each context using an active learning approach with a novel query strategy. Experiments show that WisCon significantly outperforms existing baselines in different categories (i.e., active learning methods, unsupervised contextual and non-contextual anomaly detectors) on 18 datasets. Furthermore, the results support our initial hypothesis that there is no single perfect context that successfully uncovers all kinds of contextual anomalies, and leveraging the ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù of multiple contexts is necessary.

 Scheduled Sampling in Vision-Language Pretraining with Decoupled Encoder-Decoder Network	Yehao Li, Yingwei Pan, Ting Yao, Jingwen Chen, Tao Mei	None	None	Despite having impressive vision-language (VL) pretraining with BERT-based encoder for VL understanding, the pretraining of a universal encoder-decoder for both VL understanding and generation remains challenging. The difficulty originates from the inherently different peculiarities of the two disciplines, e.g., VL understanding tasks capitalize on the unrestricted message passing across modalities, while generation tasks only employ visual-to-textual message passing. In this paper, we start with a two-stream decoupled design of encoder-decoder structure, in which two decoupled cross-modal encoder and decoder are involved to separately perform each type of proxy tasks, for simultaneous VL understanding and generation pretraining. Moreover, for VL pretraining, the dominant way is to replace some input visual/word tokens with mask tokens and enforce the multi-modal encoder/decoder to reconstruct the original tokens, but no mask token is involved when fine-tuning on downstream tasks. As an alternative, we propose a primary scheduled sampling strategy that elegantly mitigates such discrepancy via pretraining encoder-decoder in a two-pass manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the compelling generalizability of our pretrained encoder-decoder by fine-tuning on four VL understanding and generation downstream tasks.

 Detecting Deepfake Videos Using Euler Video Magnification	Rashmiranjan DasstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Gaurav NegistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Alan Smeaton,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSchool of Computing andstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTInsight Centre for Data AnalyticsDublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin, , IrelandEmail alansmeatondcuie	None	None	Recent advances in artificial intelligence make it progressively hard to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit media, especially images and videos. One recent development is the rise of deepfake videos, based on manipulating videos using advanced machine learning techniques. This involves replacing the face of an individual from a source video with the face of a second person, in the destination video. This idea is becoming progressively refined as deepfakes are getting progressively seamless and simpler to compute. Combined with the outreach and speed of social media, deepfakes could easily fool individuals when depicting someone saying things that never happened and thus could persuade people in believing fictional scenarios, creating distress, and spreading fake news. In this paper, we examine a technique for possible identification of deepfake videos. We use Euler video magnification which applies spatial decomposition and temporal filtering on video data to highlight and magnify hidden features like skin pulsation and subtle motions. Our approach uses features extracted from the Euler technique to train three models to classify counterfeit and unaltered videos and compare the results with existing techniques.

 Shortest Paths in Graphs of Convex Sets Submitted to the editors DATE. \funding National Science Foundation, award no. EFMA-1830901. Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research, award no. N00014-18-1-2210 and award no. N00014-17-1-2699.	Tobia Marcucci, Jack Umenberger, Pablo Parrilo, Russ Tedrake	tobiam@mit.edu	None	Given a graph, the shortest-path problem requires finding a sequence of edges with minimum cumulative length that connects a source vertex to a target vertex. We consider a variant of this classical problem in which the position of each vertex in the graph is a continuous decision variable constrained in a convex set, and the length of an edge is a convex function of the position of its endpoints. Problems of this form can be shown to arise in many areas, from motion planning of autonomous vehicles to optimal control of hybrid systems. The price for such a wide applicability is the complexity of this problem, which is easily seen to be NP-hard. Our main contribution is a strong and lightweight mixed-integer convex formulation based on perspective functions, that makes it possible to efficiently find globally-optimal paths in large graphs and in high-dimensional spaces.	
 An Integrated Localisation, Motion Planning and Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm in Belief Space	Antony Thomas, Fulvio Mastrogiovanni, Marco Baglietto	None	None	As robots are being increasingly used in close proximity to humans and objects, it is imperative that robots operate safely and efficiently under real-world conditions. Yet, the environment is seldom known perfectly. Noisy sensors and actuation errors compound to the errors introduced while estimating features of the environment. We present a novel approach (1) to incorporate these uncertainties for robot state estimation and (2) to compute the probability of collision pertaining to the estimated robot configurations. The expression for collision probability is obtained as an infinite series and we prove its convergence. An upper bound for the truncation error is also derived and the number of terms required is demonstrated by analyzing the convergence for different robot and obstacle configurations. We evaluate our approach using two simulation domains which use a roadmap-based strategy to synthesize trajectories that satisfy collision probability bounds.	
 Entanglement production in Einstein-Cartan theory	Alessio Belfiglio, Orlando Luongo, Stefano Mancini	alessio.belfiglio@studenti.unicam.it	None	We study the entanglement production for Dirac and Klein-Gordon fields in an expanding spacetime characterized by the presence of torsion. Torsion is here considered according to the Einstein-Cartan theory with a conformally flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. In this framework, torsion is seen as an external field, fulfilling precise constraints directly got from the cosmological constant principle. For Dirac field, we find that torsion increases the amount of entanglement. This turns out to be particularly evident for small values of particle momentum. We discuss the roles of Pauli exclusion principle in view of our results, and, in particular, we propose an interpretation of the two maxima that occur for the entanglement entropy in presence of torsion. For Klein-Gordon field, and differently from the Dirac case, the model can be exactly solved by adopting the same scale factor as in the Dirac case. Again, we show how torsion affects the amount of entanglement, providing a robust physical motivation behind the increase or decrease of entanglement entropy. A direct comparison of our findings is also discussed in view of previous results derived in absence of torsion. To this end, we give prominence on how our expectations would change in terms of the coupling between torsion and the scale factor for both Dirac and Klein-Gordon fields.

We derive, in an analytical closed-form, (1) the necessary and sufficient conditions that a patch must meet to admit this quadrangulation, and (2) a full description of the resulting tessellation(s).	
 Scaling regimes of active turbulence with external dissipation	Berta MartnezPrat, Ricard Alert, Fanlong Meng, Jordi IgnsMullol, JeanFranois Joanny, Jaume Casademunt, Ramin Golestanian, Francesc Sagus	None	None	Active fluids exhibit complex turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds number. Recent work predicted that 2d active nematic turbulence follows universal scaling laws. However, experimentally testing these predictions is conditioned by the coupling to the 3d environment. Here, we measure the spectrum of the kinetic energy, E ( q ) ùê∏ ùëû E(q) italic_E ( italic_q ) , in an active nematic film in contact with a passive oil layer. At small and intermediate scales, we find the scaling regimes E ( q ) ‚àº q ‚àí 4 similar-to ùê∏ ùëû superscript ùëû 4 E(q)\sim q^{-4} italic_E ( italic_q ) ‚àº italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and E ( q ) ‚àº q ‚àí 1 similar-to ùê∏ ùëû superscript ùëû 1 E(q)\sim q^{-1} italic_E ( italic_q ) ‚àº italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , respectively, in agreement with the theoretical prediction for 2d active nematics. At large scales, however, we find a new scaling E ( q ) ‚àº q similar-to ùê∏ ùëû ùëû E(q)\sim q italic_E ( italic_q ) ‚àº italic_q , which emerges when the dissipation is dominated by the 3d oil layer. In addition, we derive an explicit expression for the spectrum that spans all length scales, thus explaining and connecting the different scaling regimes. This allows us to fit the data and extract the length scale that controls the crossover to the new large-scale regime, which we tune by varying the oil viscosity. Overall, our work experimentally demonstrates the emergence of universal scaling laws in active turbulence, and it establishes how the spectrum is affected by external dissipation.	
 Iterated and mixed discriminants	Alicia Dickenstein, Sandra di Rocco, Ralph Morrison	alidick@dm.uba.ar	"Department of Mathematics, FCEN, University of Buenos Aires and IMAS (UBA-CONICET),
Ciudad Universitaria, Pab. I, C1428EGA Buenos Aires, Argentina"	We consider systems of Laurent polynomials with support on a fixed point configuration. In the non-defective case, the closure of the locus of coefficients giving a non-degenerate multiple root of the system is defined by a polynomial called the mixed discriminant . We define a related polynomial called the multivariate iterated discriminant , generalizing the classical Sch√§fli method for hyperdeterminants. This iterated discriminant is easier to compute and we prove that it is always divisible by the mixed discriminant. We show that tangent intersections can be computed via iteration if and only if the singular locus of a corresponding dual variety has sufficiently high codimension. We also study when point configurations corresponding to Segre-Veronese varieties and to the lattice points of planar smooth polygons, have their iterated discriminant equal to their mixed discriminant.	
 Optimizing autonomous thermal machines powered by energetic coherence	Kenza Hammam, Yassine Hassouni, Rosario Fazio, Gonzalo Manzano	None	None	The characterization and control of quantum effects in the performance of thermodynamic tasks may open new avenues for small thermal machines working in the nanoscale. We study the impact of coherence in the energy basis in the operation of a small thermal machine which can act either as a heat engine or as a refrigerator. We show that input coherence may enhance the machine performance and allow it to operate in otherwise forbidden regimes. Moreover, our results also indicate that, in some cases, coherence may also be detrimental, rendering optimization of particular models a crucial task for benefiting from coherence-induced enhancements.

 Privacy Information Classification: A Hybrid Approach	Jiaqi Wu, Weihua Li, Quan Bai, Takayuki Ito, Ahmed Moustafa	None	None	A large amount of information has been published to online social networks every day. Individual privacy-related information is also possibly disclosed unconsciously by the end users. Identifying privacy-related data and protecting the online social network users from privacy leakage turn out to be significant. Under such a motivation, this study aims to propose and develop a hybrid privacy classification approach to detect and classify privacy information from OSNs. The proposed hybrid approach employs both deep learning models and ontology-based models for privacy-related information extraction. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed hybrid approach, and the empirical results demonstrate its superiority in assisting online social network users against privacy leakage.	
 Mining Large-Scale Low-Resource Pronunciation Data From Wikipedia	Tania Chakraborty, Manasa Prasad, Theresa Breiner, Sandy Ritchie, Daan van EschGoogle Research	None	None	Pronunciation modeling is a key task for building speech technology in new languages, and while solid grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping systems exist, language coverage can stand to be improved. The information needed to build G2P models for many more languages can easily be found on Wikipedia, but unfortunately, it is stored in disparate formats. We report on a system we built to mine a pronunciation data set in 819 languages from loosely structured tables within Wikipedia. The data includes phoneme inventories, and for 63 low-resource languages, also includes the grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping. 54 of these languages do not have easily findable G2P mappings online otherwise. We turned the information from Wikipedia into a structured, machine-readable TSV format, and make the resulting data set publicly available so it can be improved further and used in a variety of applications involving low-resource languages.	
 A CONFORMALLY FLAT GENERALIZED RICCI RECURRENT SPACETIME IN ùêπ‚Å¢(ùëÖ)-GRAVITY	Avik De and TeeHow Loo and Raja Solanki and PK Sahoo	de.math@gmail.com	A. DeDepartment of Mathematical and Actuarial SciencesUniversiti Tunku Abdul RahmanJalan Sungai Long43000 CherasMalaysia	In the present paper we study a conformally flat generalized Ricci recurrent perfect fluid spacetime with constant Ricci scalar as a solution of modified F ( R ) ùêπ ùëÖ F(R) italic_F ( italic_R ) -gravity theory. We show that a Robertson-Walker spacetime is generalized Ricci Recurrent if and only if it is Ricci symmetric. The perfect fluid type matter is shown to have EoS œâ = ‚àí 1 ùúî 1 \omega=-1 italic_œâ = - 1 . Some energy conditions are analyzed with couple of popular toy models of F ( R ) ùêπ ùëÖ F(R) italic_F ( italic_R ) -gravity, like F ( R ) = R + Œ± R m ùêπ ùëÖ ùëÖ ùõº superscript ùëÖ ùëö F(R)=R+\alpha R^{m} italic_F ( italic_R ) = italic_R + italic_Œ± italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT where Œ± , m ùõº ùëö \alpha,m italic_Œ± , italic_m are constants and F ( R ) = R + Œ≤ R l n R ùêπ ùëÖ ùëÖ ùõΩ ùëÖ ùëô ùëõ ùëÖ F(R)=R+\beta RlnR italic_F ( italic_R ) = italic_R + italic_Œ≤ italic_R italic_l italic_n italic_R where Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ is constant. In harmony with the recent observational studies of accelerated expansion of the universe, both cases exhibit that the null, weak, and dominant energy conditions fulfill their requirements whereas the strong energy condition is violated.	
 Transformer Based Deliberation for Two-Pass Speech Recognition			None	Interactive speech recognition systems must generate words quickly while also producing accurate results. Two-pass models excel at these requirements by employing a first-pass decoder that quickly emits words, and a second-pass decoder that requires more context but is more accurate. Previous work has established that a deliberation network can be an effective second-pass model. The model attends to two kinds of inputs at once: encoded audio frames and the hypothesis text from the first-pass model. In this work, we explore using transformer layers instead of long-short term memory (LSTM) layers for deliberation rescoring. In transformer layers, we generalize the ‚Äúencoder-decoder‚Äù attention to attend to both encoded audio and first-pass text hypotheses. The output context vectors are then combined by a merger layer. Compared to LSTM-based deliberation, our best transformer deliberation achieves 7% relative word error rate improvements along with a 38% reduction in computation. We also compare against non-deliberation transformer rescoring, and find a 9% relative improvement.	
 Simulation of first-passage times for alternating Brownian motions		None	None	The first-passage-time problem for a Brownian motion with alternating infinitesimal moments through a constant boundary is considered under the assumption that the time intervals between consecutive changes of these moments are described by an alternating renewal process. Bounds to the first-passage-time density and distribution function are obtained, and a simulation procedure to estimate first-passage-time densities is constructed. Examples of applications to problems in environmental sciences and mathematical finance are also provided.	
 Robust photon-mediated entangling gates between quantum dot spin qubits	Ada Warren, Utkan Gngrd, Kestner, Edwin Barnes, Sophia Economou	None	None	Significant experimental advances in single-electron silicon spin qubits have opened the possibility of realizing long-range entangling gates mediated by microwave photons. Recently proposed iSWAP gates, however, require tuning qubit energies into resonance and have limited fidelity due to charge noise. We present a novel photon-mediated cross-resonance gate that is consistent with realistic experimental capabilities and requires no resonant tuning. Furthermore, we propose gate sequences capable of suppressing errors due to quasistatic noise for both the cross-resonance and iSWAP gates.

 Computational strategies and estimation performance with Bayesian semiparametric Item Response Theory models	Sally Paganin, Christopher Paciorek, Claudia Wehrhahn, Abel Rodrguez, Sophia RabeHesketh, Perry de Valpine	None	None	Item response theory (IRT) models typically rely on a normality assumption for subject-specific latent traits, which is often unrealistic in practice. Semiparametric extensions based on Dirichlet process mixtures offer a more flexible representation of the unknown distribution of the latent trait. However, the use of such models in the IRT literature has been extremely limited, in good part because of the lack of comprehensive studies and accessible software tools. This paper provides guidance for practitioners on semiparametric IRT models and their implementation. In particular, we rely on NIMBLE, a flexible software system for hierarchical models that enables the use of Dirichlet process mixtures. We highlight efficient sampling strategies for model estimation and compare inferential results under parametric and semiparametric models.	
 Decay of scalar curvature on uniformly contractible manifolds with finite asymptotic dimension	Jinmin Wang, Zhizhang Xie, Guoliang Yu	wangjinmin@fudan.edu.cn	School of Mathematical Sciences and Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University	Gromov proved a quadratic decay inequality of scalar curvature for a class of complete manifolds [ 16 ] . In this paper, we prove that for any uniformly contractible manifold with finite asymptotic dimension, its scalar curvature decays to zero at a rate depending only on the contractibility radius of the manifold and the diameter control of the asymptotic dimension. We construct examples of uniformly contractible manifolds with finite asymptotic dimension whose scalar curvature functions decay arbitrarily slowly. This shows that our result is the best possible. We prove our result by studying the index pairing between Dirac operators and compactly supported vector bundles with Lipschitz control. A key technical ingredient for the proof of our main result is a Lipschitz control for the topological K ùêæ K italic_K -theory of finite dimensional simplicial complexes.	
 The number of prime factors of integers with dense divisors	Andreas Weingartner	weingartner@suu.edu	"Department of Mathematics,

 Supercharacters of discrete algebra groups	Carlos Andr, Jocelyn Lochon	None	Centro de An√°lise Funcional, Estruturas Lineares e Aplica√ß√µes (Grupo de Estruturas Lineares e Combinat√≥rias)Departamento de Matem√°ticaFaculdade de Ci√™ncias da Universidade de LisboaCampo Grande, Edif√≠	The concept of a supercharacter theory of a finite group was introduced by Diaconis and Isaacs in [ 15 ] as an alternative to the usual irreducible character theory, and exemplified with a particular construction in the case of finite algebra groups. We extend this construction to arbitrary countable discrete algebra groups, where superclasses and indecomposable supercharacters play the role of conjugacy classes and indecomposable characters, respectively. Our construction can be understood as a cruder version of Kirillov‚Äôs orbit method and a generalisation of Diaconis and Isaacs construction for finite algebra groups. However, we adopt an ergodic theoretical point of view. The theory is then illustrated with the characterisation of the standard supercharacters of the group of upper unitriangular matrices over an algebraic closed field of prime characteristic.

 Differentiable sampling of molecular geometries with uncertainty-based adversarial attacks	Daniel SchwalbeKoda, Aik Rui Tan, Rafael GmezBombarelli	None	None	Neural network (NN) interatomic potentials provide fast prediction of potential energy surfaces, closely matching the accuracy of the electronic structure methods used to produce the training data. However, NN predictions are only reliable within well-learned training domains, and show volatile behavior when extrapolating. Uncertainty quantification approaches can flag atomic configurations for which prediction confidence is low, but arriving at such uncertain regions requires expensive sampling of the NN phase space, often using atomistic simulations. Here, we exploit automatic differentiation to drive atomistic systems towards high-likelihood, high-uncertainty configurations without the need for molecular dynamics simulations. By performing adversarial attacks on an uncertainty metric, informative geometries that expand the training domain of NNs are sampled. When combined to an active learning loop, this approach bootstraps and improves NN potentials while decreasing the number of calls to the ground truth method. This efficiency is demonstrated on sampling of kinetic barriers and collective variables in molecules, and can be extended to any NN potential architecture and materials system.

In IceCube, further challenges arise as the detector is situated at the geographic South Pole where computational resources are limited. However, to perform real-time analyses and to issue alerts to telescopes around the world, powerful and fast reconstruction methods are desired. Deep neural networks can be extremely powerful, and their usage is computationally inexpensive once the networks are trained. These characteristics make a deep learning-based approach an excellent candidate for the application in IceCube. A reconstruction method based on convolutional architectures and hexagonally shaped kernels is presented. The presented method is robust towards systematic uncertainties in the simulation and has been tested on experimental data. In comparison to standard reconstruction methods in IceCube, it can improve upon the reconstruction accuracy, while reducing the time necessary to run the reconstruction by two to three orders of magnitude.	
 Modeling surrender risk in life insurance: theoretical and experimental insight	Mark KiermayerDepartment of Natural ScienceUniversity of Applied Sciences Ruhr West	None	None	Surrender poses one of the major risks to life insurance and a sound modeling of its true probability has direct implication on the risk capital demanded by the Solvency II directive. We add to the existing literature by performing extensive experiments that present highly practical results for various modeling approaches, including XGBoost, random forest, GLM and neural networks. Further, we detect shortcomings of prevalent model assessments, which are in essence based on a confusion matrix. Our results indicate that accurate label predictions and a sound modeling of the true probability can be opposing objectives. We illustrate this with the example of resampling. While resampling is capable of improving label prediction in rare event settings, such as surrender, and thus is commonly applied, we show theoretically and numerically that models trained on resampled data predict significantly biased event probabilities. Following a probabilistic perspective on surrender, we further propose time-dependent confidence bands on predicted mean surrender rates as a complementary assessment and demonstrate its benefit. This evaluation takes a very practical, going concern perspective, which respects that the composition of a portfolio, as well as the nature of underlying risk drivers might change over time.	
 QCD EQUATION OF STATE AT FINITE CHEMICAL POTENTIALS FOR RELATIVISTIC NUCLEAR COLLISIONS	AKIHIKO MONNAI, BJRN SCHENKE, CHUN SHEN	None	Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Japan Women‚Äôs UniversityBunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8681, Japanmonnaia@fc.jwu.ac.jp	We review the equation of state of QCD matter at finite densities. We discuss the construction of the equation of state with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness using the results of lattice QCD simulations and hadron resonance gas models. Its application to the hydrodynamic analyses of relativistic nuclear collisions suggests that the interplay of multiple conserved charges is important in the quantitative understanding of the dense nuclear matter created at lower beam energies. Several different models of the QCD equation of state are discussed for comparison.	
 Fast high-fidelity single-qubit gates for flip-flop qubits in silicon	FACalderonVargas, EdwinBarnes, SophiaEEconomou	None	None	The flip-flop qubit, encoded in the states with antiparallel donor-bound electron and donor nuclear spins in silicon, showcases long coherence times, good controllability, and, in contrast to other donor-spin-based schemes, long-distance coupling. Electron spin control near the interface, however, is likely to shorten the relaxation time by many orders of magnitude, reducing the overall qubit quality factor. Here, we theoretically study the multilevel system that is formed by the interacting electron and nuclear spins and derive analytical effective two-level Hamiltonians with and without periodic driving. We then propose an optimal control scheme that produces fast and robust single-qubit gates in the presence of low-frequency noise without relying on parametrically restrictive sweet spots. This scheme increases considerably both the relaxation time and the qubit quality factor.	
 A uniform quantitative Manin‚ÄìMumford theorem for curves over function fields	Nicole Looper, Joseph Silverman, and Robert Wilms	nicole_looper@brown.edu	Nicole LooperDepartment of MathematicsBrown UniversityBox 1917151 Thayer StreetProvidence, RI 02912 USA	We prove that any smooth projective geometrically connected non-isotrivial curve of genus g ‚â• 2 ùëî 2 g\geq 2 italic_g ‚â• 2 over a one-dimensional function field of any characteristic has at most 16 g 2 + 32 g + 124 16 superscript ùëî 2 32 ùëî 124 16g^{2}+32g+124 16 italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 32 italic_g + 124 torsion points for any Abel‚ÄìJacobi embedding of the curve into its Jacobian.

More generally, we prove an explicit Bogomolov-type result bounding the number of geometric points of small N√©ron‚ÄìTate height on the curve embedded into its Jacobian.	
 A tuned mass amplifier for enhanced haptic feedback	Sai Sharan Injeti, Ali Israr, Tianshu Liu, Yiit Meng, Daniele Piazza, Dongsuk Shin	None	None	Vibro-tactile feedback is, by far the most common haptic interface in wearable or touchable devices. This feedback can be amplified by controlling the wave propagation characteristics in devices, by utilizing phenomena such as structural resonance. However, much of the work in vibro-tactile haptics has focused on amplifying local displacements in a structure by increasing local compliance. In this paper, we show that engineering the resonance mode shape of a structure with embedded localized mass amplifies the displacements without compromising on the stiffness or resonance frequency. The resulting structure, i.e., a tuned mass amplifier , produces higher tactile forces (7.7 times) compared to its counterpart without a mass, while maintaining a low frequency. We optimize the proposed design using a combination of a neural network and sensitivity analysis, and validate the results with experiments on 3-D printed structures. We also study the performance of the device on contact with a soft material, to evaluate the interaction with skin. Potential avenues for future work are also presented, including small form factor wearable haptic devices and remote haptics.

 Most Powerful Test Sequences with Early Stopping Options	Sergey Tarima, Nancy Flournoy	None	None	Sequential likelihood ratio testing is found to be most powerful in sequential studies with early stopping rules when grouped data come from the one-parameter exponential family. First, to obtain this elusive result, the probability measure of a group sequential design is constructed with support for all possible outcome events, as is useful for designing an experiment prior to having data. This construction identifies impossible events that are not part of the support. The overall probability distribution is dissected into stage specific components. These components are sub-densities of interim test statistics first described by Armitage, McPherson and Rowe (1969) that are commonly used to create stopping boundaries given an Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± -spending function and a set of interim analysis times. Likelihood expressions conditional on reaching a stage are given to connect pieces of the probability anatomy together.	
 Linearly controlled arrangement of ¬π¬≥C isotopes in single-wall carbon nanotubes	Koltai, Kuzmany, Pichler, Simon	None	None	The growth of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) inside host SWCNTs remains a compelling alternative to the conventional catalyst induced growth processes. It not only provides a catalyst free process but the ability to control the constituents of the inner tube if appropriate starting molecules are used. We report herein the growth of inner SWCNTs from 13 13 {}^{13} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C labeled toluene and natural carbon C 60 60 {}_{60} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 60 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT . The latter molecule is essentially a stopper which acts to retain the smaller toluene. The Raman spectrum of the inner nanotubes is anomalous as it contains a highly isotope shifted ‚Äùtail‚Äù, which cannot be explained by assuming a homogeneous distribution of the isotopes. Semi-empirical calculations of the Raman modes indicate that this unsual effect is explicable if small clusters of 13 13 {}^{13} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C are assumed. This indicates the absence of carbon diffusion during the inner tube growth. When combined with appropriate molecular recognition, this may enable a molecular engineering of the atomic and isotope composition of the inner tubes.	
 Dexterous Manipulation Primitives for the Real Robot Challenge	Claire ChenKrishnan SrinivasanJeffrey ZhangJunwu Zhang	None	None	This report describes our approach for Phase 3 of the Real Robot Challenge. To solve cuboid manipulation tasks of varying difficulty, we decompose each task into the following primitives: moving the fingers to the cuboid to grasp it, turning it on the table to minimize orientation error, and re-positioning it to the goal position. We use model-based trajectory optimization and control to plan and execute these primitives. These grasping, turning, and re-positioning primitives are sequenced with a state-machine that determines which primitive to execute given the current object state and goal. Our method shows robust performance over multiple runs with randomized initial and goal positions. With this approach, our team placed second in the challenge, under the anonymous name ‚Äúsombertortoise‚Äù on the leaderboard. Example runs of our method solving each of the four levels can be seen in this video .	
 Dissipative state transfer and Maxwell‚Äôs demon in single quantum trajectories: Excitation transfer between two noninteracting qubits via unbalanced dissipation rates	Fabrizio Minganti, Vincenzo Macr, Alessio Settineri, Salvatore Savasta, Franco Nori	fabrizio.minganti@riken.jp	None	We introduce a protocol to transfer excitations between two noninteracting qubits via purely dissipative processes (i.e., in the Lindblad master equation there is no coherent interaction between the qubits). The fundamental ingredients are the presence of collective (i.e. nonlocal) dissipation and unbalanced local dissipation rates (the qubits dissipate at different rates). The resulting quantum trajectories show that the measurement backaction changes the system wave function and induces a passage of the excitation from one qubit to the other. While similar phenomena have been witnessed for a non-Markovian environment, here the dissipative quantum state transfer is induced by an update of the observer knowledge of the wave function in the presence of a Markovian (memoryless) environment‚Äîthis is a single quantum trajectory effect. Beyond single quantum trajectories and postselection, such an effect can be observed by histogramming the quantum jumps along several realizations at different times. By investigating the effect of the temperature in the presence of unbalanced local dissipation, we demonstrate that, if appropriately switched on and off, the collective dissipator can act as a Maxwell‚Äôs demon. These effects are a generalized measure equivalent to the standard projective measure description of quantum teleportation and Maxwell‚Äôs demon. They can be witnessed in state-of-the-art setups given the extreme experimental control in, e.g., superconducting qubits or Rydberg atoms.	
 An Interpretation of Regularization by Denoising and its Application with The Back-Projected Fidelity Term			None	The vast majority of image recovery tasks are ill-posed problems. As such, methods that are based on optimization use cost functions that consist of both fidelity and prior (regularization) terms. A recent line of works imposes the prior by the Regularization by Denoising (RED) approach, which exploits the good performance of existing image denoising engines. Yet, the relation of RED to explicit prior terms is still not well understood, as previous work requires too strong assumptions on the denoisers. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we show that the RED gradient can be seen as a (sub)gradient of a prior function‚Äîbut taken at a denoised version of the point. As RED is typically applied with a relatively small noise level, this interpretation indicates a similarity between RED and traditional gradients. This leads to our second contribution: We propose to combine RED with the Back-Projection (BP) fidelity term rather than the common Least Squares (LS) term that is used in previous works. We show that the advantages of BP over LS for image deblurring and super-resolution, which have been demonstrated for traditional gradients, carry on to the RED approach.	
 Synthetic Generation of Three-Dimensional Cancer Cell Models from Histopathological Images	Yoav Alon, Xiang Yu, Huiyu Zhou	None	None	Synthetic generation of three-dimensional cell models from histopathological images aims to enhance understanding of cell mutation, and progression of cancer, necessary for clinical assessment and optimal treatment. Classical reconstruction algorithms based on image registration of consecutive slides of stained tissues are prone to errors and often not suitable for the training of three-dimensional segmentation algorithms. We propose a novel framework to generate synthetic three-dimensional histological models based on a generator-discriminator pattern optimizing constrained features that construct a 3D model via a Blender interface exploiting smooth shape continuity typical for biological specimens. To capture the spatial context of entire cell clusters we deploy a novel deep topology transformer that implements and attention mechanism on cell group images to extract features for the frozen feature decoder. The proposed algorithms achieves high quantitative and qualitative synthesis evident in comparative evaluation metrics such as a low Frechet-Inception scores.	
 Long directed paths in Eulerian digraphs	Oliver Janzer, Benny Sudakov, Istvn Tomon	None	None	An old conjecture of Bollob√°s and Scott asserts that every Eulerian directed graph with average degree d ùëë d italic_d contains a directed cycle of length at least Œ© ( d ) Œ© ùëë \Omega(d) roman_Œ© ( italic_d ) . The best known lower bound for this problem is Œ© ( d 1 / 2 ) Œ© superscript ùëë 1 2 \Omega(d^{1/2}) roman_Œ© ( italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) by Huang, Ma, Shapira, Sudakov and Yuster.

 The FRAM robotic telescope for atmospheric monitoring at the Pierre Auger Observatory	The Pierre Auger Collaboration et al	None	None	FRAM (F/Photometric Robotic Atmospheric Monitor) is a robotic telescope operated at the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina for the purposes of atmospheric monitoring using stellar photometry. As a passive system which does not produce any light that could interfere with the observations of the fluorescence telescopes of the observatory, it complements the active monitoring systems that use lasers. We discuss the applications of stellar photometry for atmospheric monitoring at optical observatories in general and the particular modes of operation employed by the Auger FRAM. We describe in detail the technical aspects of FRAM, the hardware and software requirements for a successful operation of a robotic telescope for such a purpose and their implementation within the FRAM system.

However, these previous studies conduct experiments on the final classification output of the network, and fail to robustly evaluate the bias contained (i) in the latent representations, and (ii) on a per-pixel level. In this paper, we design a series of experiments that overcome these issues. We do this with the goal of better understanding what type of shape information contained in the network is discriminative, where shape information is encoded, as well as when the network learns about object shape during training. We show that a network learns the majority of overall shape information at the first few epochs of training and that this information is largely encoded in the last few layers of a CNN. Finally, we show that the encoding of shape does not imply the encoding of localized per-pixel semantic information. The experimental results and findings provide a more accurate understanding of the behaviour of current CNNs, thus helping to inform future design choices.

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4 % Mask AP and 49.7 % Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt [ 67 ] evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7 % top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 1.64x faster in ‚Äúcompute‚Äù 1 1 1 Forward and backward propagation for batch size 32 time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision.

The test samples can additionally contain seen categories in the generalized variant. Existing approaches rely on learning either shared or label-specific attention from the seen classes. Nevertheless, computing reliable attention maps for unseen classes during inference in a multi-label setting is still a challenge. In contrast, state-of-the-art single-label generative adversarial network (GAN) based approaches learn to directly synthesize the class-specific visual features from the corresponding class attribute embeddings. However, synthesizing multi-label features from GANs is still unexplored in the context of zero-shot setting. In this work, we introduce different fusion approaches at the attribute-level, feature-level and cross-level (across attribute and feature-levels) for synthesizing multi-label features from their corresponding multi-label class embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to tackle the problem of multi-label feature synthesis in the (generalized) zero-shot setting. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three zero-shot image classification benchmarks: NUS-WIDE, Open Images and MS COCO. Our cross-level fusion-based generative approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on all three datasets. Furthermore, we show the generalization capabilities of our fusion approach in the zero-shot detection task on MS COCO, achieving favorable performance against existing methods.

 Quantum Simulation of Molecules without Fermionic Encoding of the Wave Function	David Mazziotti, Scott Smart, and Alexander Mazziotti	damazz@uchicago.edu	None	Molecular simulations generally require fermionic encoding in which fermion statistics are encoded into the qubit representation of the wave function. Recent calculations suggest that fermionic encoding of the wave function can be bypassed, leading to more efficient quantum computations. Here we show that the energy can be expressed as a functional of the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) where the 2-RDM is a unique functional of the unencoded N ùëÅ N italic_N -qubit-particle wave function. Contrasts are made with current hardware-efficient methods. An application to computing the ground-state energy and 2-RDM of H 4 4 {}_{4} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 4 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT is presented.	
 Reduced Order and Surrogate Models for Gravitational Waves	Manuel Tiglio, Aarn Villanueva	None	None	We present an introduction to some of the state of the art in reduced order and surrogate modeling in gravitational wave (GW) science. Approaches that we cover include Principal Component Analysis, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, the Reduced Basis approach, the Empirical Interpolation Method, Reduced Order Quadratures, and Compressed Likelihood evaluations. We divide the review into three parts: representation/compression of known data, predictive models, and data analysis. The targeted audience is that one of practitioners in GW science, a field in which building predictive models and data analysis tools that are both accurate and fast to evaluate, especially when dealing with large amounts of data and intensive computations, are necessary yet can be challenging. As such, practical presentations and, sometimes, heuristic approaches are here preferred over rigor when the latter is not available. This review aims to be self-contained, within reasonable page limits, with little previous knowledge (at the undergraduate level) requirements in mathematics, scientific computing, and other disciplines. Emphasis is placed on optimality, as well as the curse of dimensionality and approaches that might have the promise of beating it. We also review most of the state of the art of GW surrogates. Some numerical algorithms, conditioning details, scalability, parallelization and other practical points are discussed. The approaches presented are to large extent non-intrusive and data-driven and can therefore be applicable to other disciplines. We close with open challenges in high dimension surrogates, which are not unique to GW science.	
 Stability against contact interactions of a topological superconductor in two-dimensional space protected by time-reversal and reflection symmetries	mer Aksoy, JyongHao Chen, Shinsei Ryu, Akira Furusaki, Christopher Mudry	None	None	We study the stability of topological crystalline superconductors in the symmetry class DIIIR and in two-dimensional space when perturbed by quartic contact interactions. It is known that no less than eight copies of helical pairs of Majorana edge modes can be gapped out by an appropriate interaction without spontaneously breaking any one of the protecting symmetries. Hence, the noninteracting classification ‚Ñ§ ‚Ñ§ \mathbb{Z} blackboard_Z reduces to ‚Ñ§ 8 subscript ‚Ñ§ 8 \mathbb{Z}_{8} blackboard_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT when these interactions are present. It is also known that the stability when there are less than eight modes can be understood in terms of the presence of topological obstructions in the low-energy bosonic effective theories, which prevent opening of a gap. Here, we investigate the stability of the edge theories with four, two, and one edge modes, respectively. We give an analytical derivation of the topological term for the first case, because of which the edge theory remains gapless. For two edge modes, we employ bosonization methods to derive an effective bosonic action. When gapped, this bosonic theory is necessarily associated to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of either one of time-reversal or reflection symmetry whenever translation symmetry remains on the boundary. For one edge mode, stability is explicitly established in the Majorana representation of the edge theory.	
 Phase Diagram of Triangular Lattice Quantum Ising Model under External Field	Yuan Da Liao, Han Li, Zheng Yan, HaoTian Wei, Wei Li, Yang Qi, Zi Yang Meng	None	None	Quantum Ising model on a triangular lattice hosts a finite temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase with emergent U(1) symmetry, and it will transit into an up-up-down (UUD) phase with C 3 subscript ùê∂ 3 C_{3} italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT symmetry breaking upon an infinitesimal external field along the longitudinal direction, but the overall phase diagram spanned by the axes of external field and temperature remains opaque due to the lack of systematic invesitgations with controlled methodologies. By means of quantum Monte Carlo at finite temperature and ground state density matrix renormalization group simulations, we map out the phase diagram of triangular quantum Ising model. Starting from the upper BKT temperature at zero field, we obtain the phase boundary between the UUD and paramagnetic phases with its 2D q = 3 ùëû 3 q=3 italic_q = 3 Potts universality at weak field and weakly first order transition at strong field. Originated from the lower BKT temperature at zero field, we analyze the low temperature phase boundary between the clock phase and the UUD phase with Ising symmetry breaking at weak fields and the quantum phase transition between the UUD and fully polarized phases at strong fields. The accurate many-body numerical results are consistent with our field theoretical analysis. The experimental relevance towards the BKT magnet TmMgGaO 4 4 {}_{4} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 4 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and programmable quantum simulators are also discussed.

The top performing model was based on gradient boosted decision trees and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.8706 and average precision of 0.8776. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that with further research, these models can be directly applied to Korea‚Äôs healthcare system, thus increasing participation in Korea‚Äôs National Cancer Screening Program.	
 Many-body effects in the excitations and dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates	Ofir Alon, Raphael Beinke, Lorenz Cederbaum	None	None	This review explores the dynamics and the low-energy excitation spectra of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of interacting bosons in external potential traps putting particular emphasis on the emerging many-body effects beyond mean-field descriptions. To do so, methods have to be used that, in principle, can provide numerically exact results for both the dynamics and the excitation spectra in a systematic manner. Numerically exact results for the dynamics are presented employing the well-established multicongurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method. The respective excitation spectra are calculated utilizing the more recently introduced linear-response theory atop it (LR-MCTDHB). The latter theory gives rise to an, in general, non-hermitian eigenvalue problem. The theory and its newly developed implementation are described in detail and benchmarked towards the exactly-solvable harmonic-interaction model. Several applications to BECs in one- and two-dimensional potential traps are discussed. With respect to dynamics, it is shown that both the out-of-equilibrium tunneling dynamics and the dynamics of trapped vortices are of many-body nature. Furthermore, many-body effects in the excitation spectra are presented for BECs in different trap geometries. It is demonstrated that even for essentially-condensed systems, the spectrum of the lowest-in-energy excitations computed at the many-body level can differ substantially from the standard mean-field description. In general, it is shown that bosons carrying angular momentum are more sensitive to many-body effects than bosons without. These effects are present in both the dynamics and the excitation spectrum.	
 Near-Field Millimeter Wave Vector Measurements - Experimental Design & Measurement Interpretation	Laurent Chusseau, Thibaut Auriac, Jrmy Raoult	None	None	Near-field imaging experiments exist both in optics and microwaves with often different methods and theoretical supports. For millimeter waves or THz waves, techniques from both fields can be merged to identify materials at the micron scale on the surface or in near-surface volumes. The principle of such near-field vector imaging at the frequency of 60 GHz is discussed in detail here. We develop techniques for extracting vector voltages and methods for extracting the normalized near-field vector reflection on the sample. In particular, the subharmonic IQ mixer imbalance, which produced corrupted outputs either due to amplitude or phase differences, must be taken into account and compensated for to avoid any systematic errors. We provide a method to fully characterize these imperfections and to isolate the only contribution of the near-field interaction between the probe and the sample. The effects of the mechanical modulation waveform and harmonic rank used for signal acquisition are also discussed.	
 Dimensional Reduction and (Anti) de Sitter Bounds			None	Dimensional reduction has proven to be a surprisingly powerful tool for delineating the boundary between the string landscape and the swampland. Bounds from the Weak Gravity Conjecture and the Repulsive Force Conjecture, for instance, are exactly preserved under dimensional reduction. Motivated by its success in these cases, we apply a similar dimensional reduction analysis to bounds on the gradient of the scalar field potential V ùëâ V italic_V and the mass scale m ùëö m italic_m of a tower of light particles in terms of the cosmological constant Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ , which ideally may pin down ambiguous O ( 1 ) ùëÇ 1 O(1) italic_O ( 1 ) constants appearing in the de Sitter Conjecture and the (Anti) de Sitter Distance Conjecture, respectively. We find that this analysis distinguishes the bounds | ‚àá V | / V ‚â• 4 / ( d ‚àí 2 ) ‚àá ùëâ ùëâ 4 ùëë 2 |\nabla V|/V\geq\sqrt{4/(d-2)} | ‚àá italic_V | / italic_V ‚â• square-root start_ARG 4 / ( italic_d - 2 ) end_ARG , m ‚â≤ | Œõ | 1 / 2 less-than-or-similar-to ùëö superscript Œõ 1 2 m\lesssim|\Lambda|^{1/2} italic_m ‚â≤ | roman_Œõ | start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , and m ‚â≤ | Œõ | 1 / d less-than-or-similar-to ùëö superscript Œõ 1 ùëë m\lesssim|\Lambda|^{1/d} italic_m ‚â≤ | roman_Œõ | start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / italic_d end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT in d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional Planck units. The first of these bounds precludes accelerated expansion of the universe in Einstein-dilaton gravity and is almost certainly violated in our universe, though it may apply in asymptotic limits of scalar field space. The second bound cannot be satisfied in our universe, though it is saturated in supersymmetric AdS vacua with well-understood uplifts to 10d/11d supergravity. The third bound likely has a limited range of validity in quantum gravity as well, so it may or may not apply to our universe. However, if it does apply, it suggests a possible relation between the cosmological constant and the neutrino mass, which (by the see-saw mechanism) may further provide a relation between the cosmological constant problem and the hierarchy problem. We also work out the conditions for eternal inflation in general spacetime dimensions, and we comment on the behavior of these conditions under dimensional reduction.	
 The RR Lyrae Delay-Time Distribution: A Novel Perspective on Models of Old Stellar Populations	Sumit Sarbadhicary, Mairead Heiger, Carles Badenes, CeciliaMateu, Jeffrey Newman, Robin Ciardullo, Naama Hallakoun, Dan Maoz, Laura Chomiuk	None	None	The delay-time distribution (DTD) is the occurrence rate of a class of objects as a function of time after a hypothetical burst of star formation. DTDs are mainly used as a statistical test of stellar evolution scenarios for supernova progenitors, but they can be applied to many other classes of astronomical objects. We calculate the first DTD for RR Lyrae variables using 29,810 RR Lyrae from the OGLE-IV survey and a map of the stellar-age distribution (SAD) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that ‚àº 46 % similar-to absent percent 46 \sim 46\% ‚àº 46 % of the OGLE-IV RR Lyrae are associated with delay-times older than 8 Gyr (main-sequence progenitor masses less than 1 M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ), and consistent with existing constraints on their ages, but surprisingly about 51 % percent 51 51\% 51 % of RR Lyrae appear have delay times 1.2 ‚àí 8 1.2 8 1.2-8 1.2 - 8 Gyr (main-sequence masses between 1 ‚àí 2 1 2 1-2 1 - 2 M ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT at LMC metallicity). This intermediate-age signal also persists outside the Bar-region where crowding is less of a concern, and we verified that without this signal, the spatial distribution of the OGLE-IV RR Lyrae is inconsistent with the SAD map of the LMC. Since an intermediate-age RR Lyrae channel is in tension with the lack of RR Lyrae in intermediate-age clusters (noting issues with small-number statistics), and the age-metallicity constraints of LMC stars, our DTD result possibly indicates that systematic uncertainties may still exist in SAD measurements of old-stellar populations, perhaps stemming from the construction methodology or the stellar evolution models used. We described tests to further investigate this issue.	
 Contents			None		
 Contents			None	The near vanishing of the cosmological constant is one of the most puzzling open problems in theoretical physics. We consider a system, the so-called framid, that features a technically similar problem. Its stress-energy tensor has a Lorentz-invariant expectation value on the ground state, yet there are no standard, symmetry-based selection rules enforcing this, since the ground state spontaneously breaks boosts. We verify the Lorentz invariance of the expectation value in question with explicit one-loop computations. These, however, yield the expected result only thanks to highly nontrivial cancellations, which are quite mysterious from the low-energy effective theory viewpoint.	
 Superheavy scalar dark matter from gravitational particle production in ùõº-attractor models of inflation		None	None	We study the phenomenon of gravitational particle production as applied to a scalar spectator field in the context of Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± -attractor inflation. Assuming that the scalar has a minimal coupling to gravity, we calculate the abundance of gravitationally-produced particles as a function of the spectator‚Äôs mass m œá subscript ùëö ùúí m_{\chi} italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œá end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the inflaton‚Äôs Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± parameter. If the spectator is stable and sufficiently weakly coupled, such that it does not thermalize after reheating, then a population of spin-0 particles is predicted to survive in the universe today, providing a candidate for dark matter. Inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of dark matter correspond to an isocurvature component, which can be probed by measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We calculate the dark matter-photon isocurvature power spectrum and by comparing with upper limits from Planck , we infer constraints on m œá subscript ùëö ùúí m_{\chi} italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œá end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± .

 No velocity-kicks are required to explain large-distance offsets of Ca-rich supernovae and short-GRBs	Hagai PeretsstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Paz Beniamini,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPhysics Department, Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa , IsraelstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTTheoretical Astrophysics, Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics, Mail Code, Caltech, Pasadena, CA , USAstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTAstrophysics Research Center of the Open University ARCO, The Open University of Israel, PO Box , Raanana , Israel	None	None	The environments of explosive transients link their progenitors to the underlying stellar population, providing critical clues for their origins. However, some Ca-rich supernovae (SNe) and short gamma ray burst (sGRBs) appear to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large velocity kicks were imparted to their progenitors, allowing them to propagate to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in dense globular clusters residing in the halos. Here we show that instead, the large spatial-offsets of these transients are naturally explained by the observations of highly extended underlying stellar populations in (mostly early type) galaxy halos, typically missed since they can only be identified through ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, n o large velocity kicks, nor halo globular cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and no/small-natal-kicks given to sGRB progenitors. Since early-type galaxies contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar populations would have larger fractions of early-type galaxy hosts, and consequently larger fractions of transients at large offsets. This is verified by our results for sGRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions in early vs. late-type galaxies. Furthermore, once divided between early and late type galaxies, the offsets‚Äô distributions of the different transients are consistent with each other. Finally, we point out that studies of other transients‚Äô offset distribution (e.g. Ia-SNe or FRBs) should similarly consider the host galaxy-type.	
 Causality in gravitational theories with second order equations of motion	Harvey Reallhsrcamacuk	None	None	This paper considers diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity coupled to matter, with second order equations of motion. This includes Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-scalar field theory with (after field redefinitions) the most general parity-symmetric four-derivative effective field theory corrections. A gauge-invariant approach is used to study the characteristics associated to the physical degrees of freedom in an arbitrary background solution. The symmetries of the principal symbol arising from diffeomorphism invariance and the action principle are determined. For gravity coupled to a single scalar field (i.e. a Horndeski theory) it is shown that causality is governed by a characteristic polynomial of degree 6 6 6 6 which factorises into a product of quadratic and quartic polynomials. The former is defined in terms of an ‚Äúeffective metric‚Äù and is associated with a ‚Äúpurely gravitational‚Äù polarisation, whereas the latter generically involves a mixture of gravitational and scalar field polarisations. The ‚Äúfastest‚Äù degrees of freedom are associated with the quartic polynomial, which defines a surface analogous to the Fresnel surface in crystal optics. In contrast with optics, this surface is generically non-singular except on certain surfaces in spacetime. It is shown that a Killing horizon is an example of such a surface. It is also shown that a Killing horizon satisfies the zeroth law of black hole mechanics. The characteristic polynomial defines a cone in the cotangent space and a dual cone in the tangent space. The latter is used to define basic notions of causality and to provide a definition of a dynamical black hole in these theories.

The simulations are among the first to employ multi-frequency, on-the-fly radiation transfer and constrained transport ideal MHD in a cosmological context to simultaneously model the inhomogeneous process of reionization as well as the growth of primordial magnetic fields.

Likewise, detecting changes in the Ly Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± forest due to PMFs will be challenging because photoionisation and photoheating efficiently smooth the density field. However, we find that the first absorption feature in the global 21cm signal is a particularly sensitive indicator of the properties of the PMFs, even for those that satisfy our œÑ e subscript ùúè ùëí \tau_{e} italic_œÑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT constraint. Furthermore, strong PMFs can marginally increase the escape of LyC photons by up to 25% and shrink the effective radii of galaxies by ‚àº 44 % similar-to absent percent 44 \sim 44\% ‚àº 44 % which could increase the completeness fraction of galaxy surveys. Finally, our simulations show that surveys with a magnitude limit of M UV , 1500 √Ö = ‚àí 13 subscript M UV 1500 √Ö 13 {\rm M_{UV,1500\mbox{\AA}}=-13} roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_UV , 1500 √Ö end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - 13 can probe the sources that provide the majority of photons for reionization out to z = 12 ùëß 12 z=12 italic_z = 12 .	
 Extended X-ray Emission in Compton Thick AGN with Deep Chandra Observations	Mackenzie Jones, Kieran Parker, Fabbiano, Martin Elvis, Maksym, Paggi, Jingzhe Ma, Karovska, Siemiginowska, Junfeng Wang	None	None	We present the spatial analysis of five Compton thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including MKN 573, NGC 1386, NGC 3393, NGC 5643, and NGC 7212, for which high resolution Chandra observations are available. For each source, we find hard X-ray emission ( > > > 3 keV) extending to ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº kpc scales along the ionization cone, and for some sources, in the cross-cone region. This collection represents the first, high-signal sample of CT AGN with extended hard X-ray emission for which we can begin to build a more complete picture of this new population of AGN. We investigate the energy dependence of the extended X-ray emission, including possible dependencies on host galaxy and AGN properties, and find a correlation between the excess emission and obscuration, suggesting a connection between the nuclear obscuring material and the galactic molecular clouds. Furthermore, we find that the soft X-ray emission extends farther than the hard X-rays along the ionization cone, which may be explained by a galactocentric radial dependence on the density of molecular clouds due to the orientation of the ionization cone with respect to the galactic disk. These results are consistent with other CT AGN with observed extended hard X-ray emission (e.g., ESO 428-G014 and the Ma et al. 2020 CT AGN sample), further demonstrating the ubiquity of extended hard X-ray emission in CT AGN.	
 The LFU Ratio ùëÖ_ùúã in the Standard Model and Beyond	Marzia Bordone, Claudia Cornella, Gino Isidori, Matthias Knig	marzia.bordone@to.infn.it	None	We discuss the possibility of performing precise tests of Œº / e ùúá ùëí \mu/e italic_Œº / italic_e universality in B ‚Üí œÄ ‚Ñì + ‚Ñì ‚àí ‚Üí ùêµ ùúã superscript ‚Ñì superscript ‚Ñì B\to\pi\ell^{+}\ell^{-} italic_B ‚Üí italic_œÄ roman_‚Ñì start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT decays.

We present numerical expressions which can be used to extract precise information on short-distance dynamics if a deviation from universality is observed in the data.	
 Recovering Density Fields inside Quasar Proximity Zones at ùëß‚àº6	Huanqing Chen, Nickolay YGnedin	None	None	The matter density field at z ‚àº 6 similar-to ùëß 6 z\sim 6 italic_z ‚àº 6 is very challenging to probe. One of the traditional probes of the low density IGM that works successfully at lower redshifts is the Lyman-alpha forest in quasar spectra. However, at the end of reionization, the residual neutral hydrogen usually creates saturated absorption, thus much of the information about the gas density is lost. Luckily, in a quasar proximity zone, the ionizing radiation is exceptionally intense, thus creating a large region with non-zero transmitted flux. In this study we use the synthetic spectra from simulations to investigate how to recover the density fluctuations inside the quasar proximity zones. We show that, under ideal conditions, the density can be recovered accurately with a small scatter. We also discuss how systematics such as the quasar continuum fitting and reionization models affect the results. This study shows that by analyzing the absorption features inside quasar proximity zones we can potentially constrain quasar properties and the environments they reside in.	
 Spacetime Quantum Reference Frames and superpositions of proper times	Flaminia Giacomini	fgiacomini@perimeterinstitute.ca	None	In general relativity, the description of spacetime relies on idealised rods and clocks, which identify a reference frame. In any concrete scenario, reference frames are associated to physical systems, which are ultimately quantum in nature. A relativistic description of the laws of physics hence needs to take into account such quantum reference frames (QRFs), through which spacetime can be given an operational meaning.	
 Using an atom interferometer to infer gravitational entanglement generation	Daniel Carney, Holger Mller, Jacob Taylor	None	None	If gravitational perturbations are quantized into gravitons in analogy with the electromagnetic field and photons, the resulting graviton interactions should lead to an entangling interaction between massive objects. We suggest a test of this prediction. To do this, we introduce the concept of interactive quantum information sensing. This novel sensing protocol is tailored to provable verification of weak dynamical entanglement generation between a pair of systems. We show that this protocol is highly robust to typical thermal noise sources. The sensitivity can moreover be increased both using an initial thermal state and/or an initial phase of entangling via a non-gravitational interaction. We outline a concrete implementation testing the ability of the gravitational field to generate entanglement between an atomic interferometer and mechanical oscillator. Preliminary numerical estimates suggest that near-term devices could feasibly be used to perform the experiment.	
 Simple and maximally robust processes with no classical common-cause or direct-cause explanation	Marcello Nery, Marco Tlio Quintino, Philippe Allard Gurin, Thiago Maciel, Reinaldo Vianna	mnerygvb@gmail.com	None	Guided by the intuition of coherent superposition of causal relations, recent works presented quantum processes without classical common-cause and direct-cause explanation, that is, processes which cannot be written as probabilistic mixtures of quantum common-cause and quantum direct-cause relations (CCDC). In this work, we analyze the minimum requirements for a quantum process to fail to admit a CCDC explanation and present ‚Äúsimple‚Äù processes, which we prove to be the most robust ones against general noise. These simple processes can be realized by preparing a maximally entangled state and applying the identity quantum channel, thus not requiring an explicit coherent mixture of common-cause and direct-cause, exploiting the possibility of a process to have both relations simultaneously. We then prove that, although all bipartite direct-cause processes are bipartite separable operators, there exist bipartite separable processes which are not direct-cause. This shows that the problem of deciding whether a process is direct-cause is not equivalent to entanglement certification and points out the limitations of entanglement methods to detect non-classical CCDC processes. We also present a semi-definite programming hierarchy that can detect and quantify the non-classical CCDC robustnesses of every non-classical CCDC process. Among other results, our numerical methods allow us to show that the simple processes presented here are likely to be also the maximally robust against white noise. Finally, we explore the equivalence between bipartite direct-cause processes and bipartite processes without quantum memory, to present a separable process which cannot be realized as a process without quantum memory.	
 Impact of correlations and heavy-tails on quantum error correction	BD Clader, Colin Trout, Jeff Barnes, Kevin Schultz, Gregory Quiroz, Paraj Titum	dave.clader@jhuapl.edu	None	We show that space- and time-correlated single-qubit rotation errors can lead to high-weight errors in a quantum circuit when the rotation angles are drawn from heavy-tailed distributions. This leads to a breakdown of quantum error correction , yielding reduced or in some cases no protection of the encoded logical qubits. While heavy-tailed phenomena are prevalent in the natural world, there is very little research as to whether noise with these statistics exist in current quantum processing devices. Furthermore, it is an open problem to develop tomographic or noise spectroscopy protocols that could test for the existence of noise with such statistics. These results suggest the need for quantum characterization methods that can reliably detect or reject the presence of such errors together with continued first-principles studies of the origins of space- and time-correlated noise in quantum processors. If such noise does exist, physical or control-based mitigation protocols must be developed to mitigate this noise as it would severely hinder the performance of fault-tolerant quantum computers.	
 Towards studying the structural differences between the pion and its radial excitation	Xiang Gao, Nikhil Karthik, Swagato Mukherjee, Peter Petreczky, Sergey Syritsyn, Yong Zhao	xgao@bnl.gov	None	We present an exploratory lattice QCD investigation of the differences between the valence quark structure of pion and its radial excitation œÄ ( 1300 ) ùúã 1300 \pi(1300) italic_œÄ ( 1300 ) in a fixed finite volume using the leading-twist factorization approach. We present evidences that the first pion excitation in our lattice computation is a single particle state that is likely to be the finite volume realization of œÄ ( 1300 ) ùúã 1300 \pi(1300) italic_œÄ ( 1300 ) . An analysis with reasonable priors result in better estimates of the excited state PDF and the moments, wherein we find evidence that the radial excitation of pion correlates with an almost two-fold increase in the momentum fraction of valence quarks. This proof-of-principle work establishes the viability of future lattice computations incorporating larger operator basis that can resolve the structural changes accompanying hadronic excitation.	
 Statistical physics through the lens of real-space mutual information	Doruk Efe Gkmen, Zohar Ringel, Sebastian Huber, Maciej KochJanusz	None	None	Identifying the relevant degrees of freedom in a complex physical system is a key stage in developing effective theories in and out of equilibrium. The celebrated renormalization group provides a framework for this, but its practical execution in unfamiliar systems is fraught with ad hoc choices, whereas machine learning approaches, though promising, lack formal interpretability. Here we present an algorithm employing state-of-art results in machine-learning-based estimation of information-theoretic quantities, overcoming these challenges, and use this advance to develop a new paradigm in identifying the most relevant operators describing properties of the system. We demonstrate this on an interacting model, where the emergent degrees of freedom are qualitatively different from the microscopic constituents. Our results push the boundary of formally interpretable applications of machine learning, conceptually paving the way towards automated theory building.	
 Unlocking starlight subtraction in full data rate exoplanet imaging by efficiently updating Karhunen-Lo√®ve eigenimages	Joseph Long, Jared Males	None	None	Starlight subtraction algorithms based on the method of Karhunen-Lo√®ve eigenimages have proved invaluable to exoplanet direct imaging. However, they scale poorly in runtime when paired with differential imaging techniques. In such observations, reference frames and frames to be starlight-subtracted are drawn from the same set of data, requiring a new subset of references (and eigenimages) for each frame processed to avoid self-subtraction of the signal of interest. The data rates of extreme adaptive optics instruments are such that the only way to make this computationally feasible has been to downsample the data. We develop a technique that updates a pre-computed singular value decomposition of the full dataset to remove frames (i.e. a ‚Äúdowndate‚Äù) without a full recomputation, yielding the modified eigenimages. This not only enables analysis of much larger data volumes in the same amount of time, but also exhibits near-linear scaling in runtime as the number of observations increases. We apply this technique to archival data and investigate its scaling behavior for very large numbers of frames N ùëÅ N italic_N . The resulting algorithm provides speed improvements of 2.6 √ó 2.6\times 2.6 √ó (for 200 eigenimages at N = 300 ùëÅ 300 N=300 italic_N = 300 ) to 140 √ó 140\times 140 √ó (at N = 10 4 ùëÅ superscript 10 4 N=10^{4} italic_N = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) with the advantage only increasing as N ùëÅ N italic_N grows. This algorithm has allowed us to substantially accelerate KLIP even for modest N ùëÅ N italic_N , and will let us quickly explore how KLIP parameters affect exoplanet characterization in large N ùëÅ N italic_N datasets.	
 Momentum space parity-odd CFT 3-point functions	Sachin Jain, Renjan Rajan John, Abhishek Mehta, Amin ANizami, Adithya Suresh	None	None	We study the parity-odd sector of 3-point functions comprising of scalar operators and conserved currents in conformal field theories in momentum space. We use momentum space conformal Ward identities as well as spin-raising and weight-shifting operators to fix the form of these correlators. We discuss in detail the regularisation of divergences and their renormalisation using specific counter-terms.	
 Contents			None	We study in detail various information theoretic quantities with the intent of distinguishing between different charged sectors in fractionalized states of large- N ùëÅ N italic_N gauge theories. For concreteness, we focus on a simple holographic ( 2 + 1 ) 2 1 (2+1) ( 2 + 1 ) -dimensional strongly coupled electron fluid whose charged states organize themselves into fractionalized and coherent patterns at sufficiently low temperatures. However, we expect that our results are quite generic and applicable to a wide range of systems, including non-holographic. The probes we consider include the entanglement entropy, mutual information, entanglement of purification and the butterfly velocity. The latter turns out to be particularly useful, given the universal connection between momentum and charge diffusion in the vicinity of a black hole horizon. The RT surfaces used to compute the above quantities, though, are largely insensitive to the electric flux in the bulk. To address this deficiency, we propose a generalized entanglement functional that is motivated through the Iyer‚ÄìWald formalism, applied to a gravity theory coupled to a U ( 1 ) ùëà 1 U(1) italic_U ( 1 ) gauge field. We argue that this functional gives rise to a coarse grained measure of entanglement in the boundary theory which is obtained by tracing over (part) of the fractionalized and cohesive charge degrees of freedom. Based on the above, we construct a candidate for an entropic c ùëê c italic_c -function that accounts for the existence of bulk charges. We explore some of its general properties and their significance, and discuss how it can be used to efficiently account for charged degrees of freedom across different energy scales.	
 Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts with late secondary peaks observed from 4U 1608-52	Tolga Gver, Tuba Boztepe, Ersin, Manoneeta Chakraborty, Tod Strohmayer, Peter Bult, Diego Altamirano, Gaurava Jaisawal, Tue Kocabyk, CMalacaria, Unnati Kashyap, Keith Gendreau, Zaven Arzoumanian, Deepto Chakrabarty	None	None	We report the temporal and spectral analysis of three thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1608 ‚àí - - 52, observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during and just after the outburst observed from the source in 2020. In two of the X-ray bursts, we detect secondary peaks, 30 and 18 seconds after the initial peaks. The secondary peaks show a fast rise exponential decay-like shape resembling a thermonuclear X-ray burst. Time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis reveals that the peak flux, blackbody temperature, and apparent emitting radius values of the initial peaks are in agreement with X-ray bursts previously observed from 4U 1608 ‚àí - - 52, while the same values for the secondary peaks tend toward the lower end of the distribution of bursts observed from this source. The third X-ray burst, which happened during much lower accretion rates did not show any evidence for a deviation from an exponential decay and was significantly brighter than the previous bursts. We present the properties of the secondary peaks and discuss the events within the framework of short recurrence time bursts or bursts with secondary peaks. We find that the current observations do not fit in standard scenarios and challenge our understanding of flame spreading.

 A Bright Source of Telecom Single Photons Based on Quantum Frequency Conversion	Christopher Morrison, Markus Rambach, Zhe Xian Koong, Francesco Graffitti, Fiona Thorburn, Ajoy Kar, Yong Ma, SukIn Park, Jin Dong Song, Nick Stoltz, Dirk Bouwmeester, Alessandro Fedrizzi, Brian Gerardot	clm6@hw.ac.uk	None	On-demand indistinguishable single photon sources are essential for quantum networking and communication. Semiconductor quantum dots are among the most promising candidates, but their typical emission wavelength renders them unsuitable for use in fibre networks. Here, we present quantum frequency conversion of near-infrared photons from a bright quantum dot to the telecommunication C-band, allowing integration with existing fibre architectures. We use a custom-built, tunable 2400 nm seed laser to convert single photons from 942 nm to 1550 nm in a difference frequency generation process. We achieve an end-to-end conversion efficiency of ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 35%, demonstrate count rates approaching 1 MHz at 1550 nm with g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) = 0.04 superscript ùëî 2 0 0.04 g^{\left(2\right)}\left(0\right)=0.04 italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 2 ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( 0 ) = 0.04 , and achieve Hong-Ou-Mandel visibilities of 60%. We expect this scheme to be preferable to quantum dot sources directly emitting at telecom wavelengths for fibre based quantum networking.

For a small fraction of these sources, the astrometric solutions are poor, and the reported values and uncertainties may not apply. Before any analysis, it is important to recognize and excise these spurious results ‚Äì this is commonly done by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here, we devise a means of separating ‚Äúgood‚Äù from ‚Äúbad‚Äù astrometric solutions that is an order of magnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3% pure and 97.3% complete, as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions, with parallax that is negative at ‚â• 4.5 œÉ absent 4.5 ùúé \geq 4.5\sigma ‚â• 4.5 italic_œÉ ; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions, including sources in HEALPix pixels on the sky that do not contain such negative parallaxes, and sources that fall on the main sequence in a color‚Äìabsolute magnitude diagram. We then train a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and information about nearby sources to discriminate between these two samples, captured in a single ‚Äúastrometric fidelity‚Äù parameter. A diverse set of verification tests shows that our approach works very cleanly, including for sources with positive parallaxes. The main limitations of our approach are in the very low-SNR and the crowded regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all of eDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory, our code and data are public.	
 Monodromy methods for torus conformal blocks and entanglement entropy at large central charge	Marius Gerbershagen	marius.gerbershagen@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de	None	We compute the entanglement entropy in a two dimensional conformal field theory at finite size and finite temperature in the large central charge limit via the replica trick. We first generalize the known monodromy method for the calculation of conformal blocks on the plane to the torus. Then, we derive a monodromy method for the zero-point conformal blocks of the replica partition function. We explain the differences between the two monodromy methods before applying them to the calculation of the entanglement entropy. We find that the contribution of the vacuum exchange dominates the entanglement entropy for a large class of CFTs, leading to universal results in agreement with holographic predictions from the RT formula. Moreover, we determine in which regime the replica partition function agrees with a correlation function of local twist operators on the torus.

 A cautionary tale in fitting galaxy rotation curves with Bayesian techniques: does Newton‚Äôs constant vary from galaxy to galaxy?	Pengfei Li,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Federico Lelli, Stacy McGaugh, James Schombert, KyuHyun Chae	None	None	The application of Bayesian techniques to astronomical data is generally non-trivial because the fitting parameters can be strongly degenerated and the formal uncertainties are themselves uncertain. An example is provided by the contradictory claims over the presence or absence of a universal acceleration scale (g ‚Ä† ‚Ä† {}_{\dagger} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) in galaxies based on Bayesian fits to rotation curves. To illustrate the situation, we present an analysis in which the Newtonian gravitational constant G N subscript ùê∫ ùëÅ G_{N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy when fitting rotation curves from the SPARC database, in analogy to g ‚Ä† subscript ùëî ‚Ä† g_{\dagger} italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the recently debated Bayesian analyses. When imposing flat priors on G N subscript ùê∫ ùëÅ G_{N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , we obtain a wide distribution of G N subscript ùê∫ ùëÅ G_{N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT which, taken at face value, would rule out G N subscript ùê∫ ùëÅ G_{N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as a universal constant with high statistical confidence. However, imposing an empirically motivated log-normal prior returns a virtually constant G N subscript ùê∫ ùëÅ G_{N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with no sacrifice in fit quality. This implies that the inference of a variable G N subscript ùê∫ ùëÅ G_{N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (or g ‚Ä† ‚Ä† {}_{\dagger} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) is the result of the combined effect of parameter degeneracies and unavoidable uncertainties in the error model. When these effects are taken into account, the SPARC data are consistent with a constant G N subscript ùê∫ N G_{\rm N} italic_G start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_N end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (and constant g ‚Ä† subscript ùëî ‚Ä† g_{\dagger} italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ).	
 AGN-driven galactic outflows: comparing models to observations	IshibashistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, FabianstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand ArakawastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPhysikInstitut, Universitat Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse , Zurich, SwitzerlandstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTInstitute of Astronomy, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB HA	None	None	The actual mechanism(s) powering galactic outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still a matter of debate. At least two physical models have been considered in the literature: wind shocks and radiation pressure on dust. Here we provide a first quantitative comparison of the AGN radiative feedback scenario with observations of galactic outflows. We directly compare our radiation pressure-driven shell models with the observational data from the most recent compilation of molecular outflows on galactic scales. We show that the observed dynamics and energetics of galactic outflows can be reproduced by AGN radiative feedback, with the inclusion of radiation trapping and/or luminosity evolution. The predicted scalings of the outflow energetics with AGN luminosity can also quantitatively account for the observational scaling relations. Furthermore, sources with both ultra-fast and molecular outflow detections are found to be located in the ‚Äòforbidden‚Äô region of the N H ‚àí Œª subscript ùëÅ H ùúÜ N_{\mathrm{H}}-\lambda italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_Œª plane. Overall, an encouraging agreement is obtained over a wide range of AGN and host galaxy parameters. We discuss our results in the context of recent observational findings and numerical simulations. In conclusion, AGN radiative feedback is a promising mechanism for driving galactic outflows that should be considered, alongside wind feedback, in the interpretation of future observational data.	
 Green function estimates on complements of low-dimensional uniformly rectifiable sets	Guy David, Joseph Feneuil, Svitlana Mayboroda	guy.david@universite-paris-saclay.fr	"Guy David.

91405, Orsay, France"	It has been recently established in [ DM2 ] that on uniformly rectifiable sets the Green function is almost affine in the weak sense, and moreover, in some scenarios such Green function estimates are equivalent to the uniform rectifiability of a set. The present paper tackles a strong analogue of these results, starting with the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù degenerate operators on sets with lower dimensional boundaries.	
 Predictive Control and Communication Co-Design via Two-Way Gaussian Process Regression and AoI-Aware Scheduling	Abanoub MGirgis,daggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTJihongPark,MehdiBennis,andddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMrouaneDebbah	None	None	This article studies the joint problem of uplink-downlink scheduling and power allocation for controlling a large number of actuators that upload their states to remote controllers and download control actions over wireless links. To overcome the lack of wireless resources, we propose a machine learning-based solution, where only a fraction of actuators is controlled, while the rest of the actuators are actuated by locally predicting the missing state and/or action information using the previous uplink and/or downlink receptions via a Gaussian process regression (GPR). This GPR prediction credibility is determined using the age-of-information (AoI) of the latest reception. Moreover, the successful reception is affected by the transmission power, mandating a co-design of the communication and control operations. To this end, we formulate a network-wide minimization problem of the average AoI and transmission power under communication reliability and control stability constraints. To solve the problem, we propose a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization framework. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can stably control 2 2 2 2 x more number of actuators compared to an event-triggered scheduling baseline with Kalman filtering and frequency division multiple access, which is 18 18 18 18 x larger than a round-robin scheduling baseline.	
 Island Finder and Entropy Bound	Raphael Bousso, and Arvin ShahbaziMoghaddam	None	None	Identifying an entanglement island requires exquisite control over the entropy of quantum fields, which is available only in toy models. Here we present a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of an island and place an upper bound on the entropy computed by the island rule. This is enough to derive the main features of the Page curve for an evaporating black hole in any spacetime dimension. Our argument makes use of Wall‚Äôs maximin formulation and the Quantum Focusing Conjecture. As a corollary, we derive a novel entropy bound.	
 Multigrid reduction preconditioning framework for coupled processes in porous and fractured media	QuanMBui, FranoisPHamon, NicolaCastelletto, DanielOseiKuffuor, RandolphRSettgast, JoshuaAWhite	bui9@llnl.gov	Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, United States	Many subsurface engineering applications involve tight-coupling between fluid flow, solid deformation, fracturing, and similar processes. To better understand the complex interplay of different governing equations, and therefore design efficient and safe operations, numerical simulations are widely used. Given the relatively long time-scales of interest, fully-implicit time-stepping schemes are often necessary to avoid time-step stability restrictions. A major computational bottleneck for these methods, however, is the linear solver. These systems are extremely large and ill-conditioned. Because of the wide range of processes and couplings that may be involved‚Äîe.g. formation and propagation of fractures, deformation of the solid porous medium, viscous flow of one or more fluids in the pores and fractures, complicated well sources and sinks, etc.‚Äîit is difficult to develop general-purpose but scalable linear solver frameworks. This challenge is further aggravated by the range of different discretization schemes that may be adopted, which have a direct impact on the linear system structure. To address this obstacle, we describe a flexible strategy based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that can produce purely algebraic preconditioners for a wide spectrum of relevant physics and discretizations. We demonstrate that MGR, guided by physics and theory in block preconditioning, can tackle several distinct and challenging problems, notably: a hybrid discretization of single-phase flow, compositional multiphase flow with complex wells, and hydraulic fracturing simulations. Extension to other systems can be handled quite naturally. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the resulting solvers through numerical examples of difficult, field-scale problems.	
 Broad-band spectroscopy of a vanadyl porphyrin: a model electronuclear spin qudit			None		
 Spatio-temporal characterization of ultrashort vector pulses	Apostolos Zdagkas, Venkatram Nalla, Nikitas Papasimakis, Nikolay Zheludev	None	None	Ultrafast vectorially polarized pulses have found many applications in information and energy transfer owing mainly to the presence of strong longitudinal components and their space-polarization non-separability. Due to their broad spectrum, such pulses often exhibit space-time couplings, which significantly affect the pulse propagation dynamics leading to reduced energy density or utilized to create new effects like a rotating or sliding wavefront at focus. Here, we present a new method for the spatio-temporal characterization of ultrashort cylindrical vector pulses based on a combination of spatially resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy and Mach-Zehnder interferometry. The method provides access to spatially resolved spectral amplitudes and phases of all polarization components of the pulse. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by completely characterizing a 10 10 10 10 fs radially polarized pulse from a Ti:sapphire laser at 800 800 800 800 nm.

Our calculations show that this result does not necessarily indicate an unusual [ 12 12 {}^{12} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO/ 13 13 {}^{13} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO] abundance ratio but rather that 12 12 {}^{12} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO (1-0) is optically thin due to high temperatures and/or large linewidths associated with the inner decoupled, misaligned molecular structure. Line ratios of the higher-density tracers suggest that the densest phase of molecular gas in NGC 7465 has a lower density than is typical for nearby galaxies, possibly as a result of the recent gas accretion. All of the observed molecular properties of NGC 7465 are consistent with it having acquired its molecular (and atomic) gas from a spiral galaxy. Further detailed studies of the CO isotopologues in other early-type galaxies would be valuable for investigating the histories of those that may have acquired their gas from dwarfs. Finally, these ALMA data also show an unidentified line source that is probably a background galaxy similar to those found at z = 1 ‚àí 3 ùëß 1 3 z=1-3 italic_z = 1 - 3 in blind CO surveys.	
 List-Decodable Coded Computing: Breaking the Adversarial Toleration Barrier		None	None	We consider the problem of coded computing, where a computational task is performed in a distributed fashion in the presence of adversarial workers. We propose techniques to break the adversarial toleration threshold barrier previously known in coded computing. More specifically, we leverage list-decoding techniques for folded Reed-Solomon codes and propose novel algorithms to recover the correct codeword using side information. In the coded computing setting, we show how the master node can perform certain carefully designed extra computations to obtain the side information. The workload of computing this side information is negligible compared to the computations done by each worker. This side information is then utilized to prune the output of the list decoder and uniquely recover the true outcome. We further propose folded Lagrange coded computing (FLCC) to incorporate the developed techniques into a specific coded computing setting. Our results show that FLCC outperforms LCC by breaking the barrier on the number of adversaries that can be tolerated. In particular, the corresponding threshold in FLCC is improved by a factor of two asymptotically compared to that of LCC.

 The black hole spin in GRS 1915+105, revisited	Brianna Mills, Shane Davis, Matthew Middleton	bri@virginia.edu	None	We estimate the black hole spin parameter in GRS 1915+105 using the continuum-fitting method with revised mass and inclination constraints based on the very long baseline interferometric parallax measurement of the distance to this source. We fit Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations selected to be accretion disk-dominated spectral states as described in McClinotck et al. (2006) and Middleton et al. (2006), which previously gave discrepant spin estimates with this method. We find that, using the new system parameters, the spin in both datasets increased, providing a best-fit spin of a * = 0.86 subscript ùëé 0.86 a_{*}=0.86 italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT * end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.86 for the Middleton et al. data and a poor fit for the McClintock et al. dataset, which becomes pegged at the BHSPEC model limit of a * = 0.99 subscript ùëé 0.99 a_{*}=0.99 italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT * end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.99 . We explore the impact of the uncertainties in the system parameters, showing that the best-fit spin ranges from a * = 0.4 subscript ùëé 0.4 a_{*}=0.4 italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT * end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.4 to 0.99 for the Middleton et al. dataset and allows reasonable fits to the McClintock et al. dataset with near maximal spin for system distances greater than ‚àº 10 similar-to absent 10 \sim 10 ‚àº 10 kpc. We discuss the uncertainties and implications of these estimates.	
 G-MIND: An End-to-End Multimodal Imaging-Genetics Framework for Biomarker Identification and Disease Classification	Sayan Ghosal, Qiang Chen, Giulio Pergola, Aaron Goldman, William Ulrich, Karen Berman, Giuseppe Blasi, Leonardo Fazio, Antonio Rampino, Alessandro Bertolino, Daniel Weinberger, Venkata Mattay, Archana Venkataraman	None	None	We propose a novel deep neural network architecture to integrate imaging and genetics data, as guided by diagnosis, that provides interpretable biomarkers. Our model consists of an encoder, a decoder and a classifier. The encoder learns a non-linear subspace shared between the input data modalities. The classifier and the decoder act as regularizers to ensure that the low-dimensional encoding captures predictive differences between patients and controls. We use a learnable dropout layer to extract interpretable biomarkers from the data, and our unique training strategy can easily accommodate missing data modalities across subjects. We have evaluated our model on a population study of schizophrenia that includes two functional MRI (fMRI) paradigms and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data. Using 10-fold cross validation, we demonstrate that our model achieves better classification accuracy than baseline methods, and that this performance generalizes to a second dataset collected at a different site. In an exploratory analysis we further show that the biomarkers identified by our model are closely associated with the well-documented deficits in schizophrenia.	
 GTH Algorithm, Censored Markov Chains, and ùëÖ‚Å¢ùê∫-Factorization (dedicated to Dr. Winfried Grassmann)	Yiqiang ZhaoSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada KS	None	None	In this paper, we provide a review on the GTH algorithm, which is a numerically stable algorithm for computing stationary probabilities of a Markov chain. Mathematically the GTH algorithm is an rearrangement of Gaussian elimination, and therefore they are mathematically equivalent. All components in the GTH algorithm can be interpreted probabilistically based on the censoring concept and each elimination in the GTH algorithm leads to a censored Markov chain. The R G ùëÖ ùê∫ RG italic_R italic_G -factorization is a counterpart to the LU-decomposition for Gaussian elimination. The censored Markov chain can also be treated as an extended version of the GTH algorithm for a system consisting of infinitely many linear equations.

 A two-sex branching process with oscillations: application to predator-prey systems	Cristina Gutirrez, Carmen Minuesa	None	None	A two-type two-sex branching process is introduced with the aim of describing the interaction of predator and prey populations with sexual reproduction and promiscuous mating. In each generation and in each species the total number of individuals which mate and produce offspring is controlled by a binomial distribution with size given by this number of individuals and probability of success depending on the density of preys per predator. The resulting model enables us to depict the typical cyclic behaviour of predator-prey systems under some mild assumptions on the shape of the function that characterises the probability of survival of the previous binomial distribution. We present some basic results about fixation and extinction of both species as well as conditions for the coexistence of both of them. We also analyse the suitability of the process to model real ecosystems comparing our model with a real dataset.	
 Optimal Utilization Strategy of the LiFePO‚ÇÑ Battery Storage	Timur Sayfutdinov, Petr Vorobev	None	Center for Energy Science and Technology, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 3 Nobel Street, Skolkovo, Moscow Region 121205, Russia	The paper provides a comprehensive battery storage modelling approach, which accounts for operation- and degradation-aware characteristics and can be used in optimization problem formulations. Particularly, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) compatible models have been developed for the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 4 {}_{4} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 4 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) battery storage using the Special Order Sets 2 to represent the nonlinear characteristics, including efficiency, internal resistance growth, and capacity fade. Such formulation can be used in problems related to various applications, i.e., power systems, smart grid, and vehicular applications, and it allows finding the globally optimal solution using off-the-shelf academic and commercial solvers. In the numerical study, the proposed modelling approach has been applied to realistic scenarios of peak-shaving, where the importance of considering the developed models is explicitly demonstrated. Operation- and degradation-aware techno-economic analysis showed that the optimal battery capacity is driven by operating rather than service requirements. Particularly, a considerable battery over-sizing becomes economically feasible when the battery storage is used more extensively. Another finding suggests that to achieve the maximum value from battery storage, its operation strategy needs to be significantly modified during the course of its lifetime. In the scenarios considered, the charging time gradually increased from four to seven hours, while the average SoC decreased by 20%. Such an adaptable scheduling results in reduced battery degradation and a longer lifetime, which may provide as much as 12.1% of savings in the battery storage system project.	
 Long-range order in quadrupolar systems on spherical surfaces	Andra Gnidovec and Simon opar	None	None	Understanding the interplay between topology and ordering in systems on curved manifolds, governed by anisotropic interactions, takes a central role in many fields of physics. In this paper, we investigate the effects of lattice symmetry and local positional order on orientational ordering in systems of long-range interacting point quadrupoles on a sphere in the zero temperature limit. Locally triangular spherical lattices show long-range ordered quadrupolar configurations only for specific symmetric lattices as strong geometric frustration prevents general global ordering. Conversely, the ground states on Caspar-Klug lattices are more diverse, with many different symmetries depending on the position of quadrupoles within the fundamental domain. We also show that by constraining the quadrupole tilts with respect to the surface normal, which models interactions with the substrate, and by considering general quadrupole tensors, we can manipulate the ground state configuration symmetry.	
 Kernel Method ‚Äî An Analytic Approach for Tail Asymptotics in Stationary Probabilities of 2-Dimensional Queueing Systems	Yiqiang ZhaoSchool of Mathematics and StatisticsCarleton University, Ottawa, ON Canada KS	None	None	In this paper, we provide a review on the kernel method, which is one of the options for characterizing so-called exact tail asymptotic properties in stationary probabilities of two-dimensional random walks, discrete or continuous (or mixed), in the quarter plane. Many two-dimensional queueing systems can be modelled via these types of random walks. Stationary probabilities are one of the most sought statistical quantities in queueing analysis. However, explicit expressions are available only for a very limited number of models. Therefore, tail asymptotic properties become more important, since they provide insightful information into the structure of the tail probabilities, and often lead to approximations, performance bounds, algorithms, among possible others.	
 Transfer-tensor description of memory effects in open-system dynamics and multi-time statistics	Stefano Gherardini, Andrea Smirne, Susana Huelga, Filippo Caruso	gherardini@lens.unifi.it	None	The non-Markovianity of an arbitrary open quantum system is analyzed in reference to the multi-time statistics given by its monitoring at discrete times. On the one hand, we exploit the hierarchy of inhomogeneous transfer tensors, which provides us with relevant information about the role of correlations between the system and the environment in the dynamics. The connection between the transfer-tensor hierarchy and the CP-divisibility property is then investigated, by showing to what extent quantum Markovianity can be linked to a description of the open-system dynamics by means of the composition of 1-step transfer tensors only. On the other hand, we introduce the set of stochastic transfer tensor transformations associated with local measurements on the open system at different times and conditioned on the measurement outcomes. The use of the transfer-tensor formalism accounts for different kinds of memory effects in the multi-time statistics and allows us to compare them on a similar footing with the memory effects present in non-monitored non-Markovian dynamics, as we illustrate on a spin-boson case study.	
 De Giorgi‚Äôs inequality for the thresholding scheme with arbitrary mobilities and surface tensions	Tim Laux, Jona Lelmi	tim.laux@hcm.uni-bonn.de	Institut f√ºr angewandte Mathematik, Universit√§t Bonn, Endenicher Allee 60, 53115 Bonn, Germany	We provide a new convergence proof of the celebrated Merriman-Bence-Osher scheme for multiphase mean curvature flow. Our proof applies to the new variant incorporating a general class of surface tensions and mobilities, including typical choices for modeling grain growth. The basis of the proof are the minimizing movements interpretation of Esedoƒülu and Otto and De Giorgi‚Äôs general theory of gradient flows. Under a typical energy convergence assumption we show that the limit satisfies a sharp energy-dissipation relation.	
 Vortex Ordering and Dynamics on Santa Fe Artificial Ice Pinning Arrays	Wenzhao Li, Reichhardt, JankstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, ReichhardtstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We numerically examine the ordering, pinning and flow of superconducting vortices interacting with a Santa Fe artificial ice pinning array. We find that as a function of magnetic field and pinning density, a wide variety of vortex states occur, including ice rule obeying states and labyrinthine patterns. In contrast to square pinning arrays, we find no sharp peaks in the critical current due to the inherent frustration effect imposed by the Santa Fe ice geometry; however, there are some smoothed peaks when the number of vortices matches the number of pinning sites. For some fillings, the Santa Fe array exhibits stronger pinning than the square array due to the suppression of one-dimensional flow channels when the vortex motion in the Santa Fe lattice occurs through the formation of both longitudinal and transverse flow channels.	
 On Statistical Bias In Active Learning: How and When to Fix It	Sebastian FarquhardaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Yarin GaldaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tom RainforthabsentddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversity of Oxford,daggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTOATML, Department of Computer ScienceddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Statistics	None	None	Active learning is a powerful tool when labelling data is expensive, but it introduces a bias because the training data no longer follows the population distribution. We formalize this bias and investigate the situations in which it can be harmful and sometimes even helpful. We further introduce novel corrective weights to remove bias when doing so is beneficial. Through this, our work not only provides a useful mechanism that can improve the active learning approach, but also an explanation of the empirical successes of various existing approaches which ignore this bias. In particular, we show that this bias can be actively helpful when training overparameterized models‚Äîlike neural networks‚Äîwith relatively little data.

J. H. M. M. Schmitt: Hamburger Sternwarte, Universit√§t Hamburg, "	In search for a connection between the formation of stars and the formation of planets, a new semi-automatic spectral analysis method using iSpec was developed for the TIGRE telescope installed in Guanajuato, Mexico.

We leverage information-theoretic quantities, such as entropy and mutual information, to quantify the level of informativeness and rigorously characterize the amount of information contained in any subset of the complete collection of order statistics. As an example, we show how these informativeness metrics can be evaluated for a sample of discrete Bernoulli and continuous Uniform random variables. Finally, we unveil how our most informative order statistics framework can be applied to image processing applications. Specifically, we investigate how the proposed measures can be used to choose the coefficients of the L-estimator filter to denoise an image corrupted by random noise. We show that both for discrete (e.g., salt-pepper noise) and continuous (e.g., mixed Gaussian noise) noise distributions, the proposed method is competitive with off-the-shelf filters, such as the median and the total variation filters, as well as with wavelet-based denoising methods.

 A Zero-Sum Deterministic Impulse Controls Game in Infinite Horizon with a New HJBI QVI	Brahim El Asri , Hafid Lalioui and Sehail Mazid	None	None	In the present paper, we study a two-player zero-sum deterministic differential game with both players adopting impulse controls, in infinite time horizon, under rather weak assumptions on the cost functions. We prove by means of the dynamic programming principle (DPP) that the lower and upper value functions are continuous and viscosity solutions to the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) quasi-variational inequality (QVI). We define a new HJBI QVI for which, under a proportional property assumption on the maximizer cost, the value functions are the unique viscosity solution. We then prove that the lower and upper value functions coincide.	
 Bounds on mutual information of mixture data for classification tasks	Yijun Ding, Amit Ashok	None	None	The data for many classification problems, such as pattern and speech recognition, follow mixture distributions. To quantify the optimum performance for classification tasks, the Shannon mutual information is a natural information-theoretic metric, as it is directly related to the probability of error. The mutual information between mixture data and the class label does not have an analytical expression, nor any efficient computational algorithms. We introduce a variational upper bound, a lower bound, and three estimators, all employing pair-wise divergences between mixture components. We compare the new bounds and estimators with Monte Carlo stochastic sampling and bounds derived from entropy bounds. To conclude, we evaluate the performance of the bounds and estimators through numerical simulations.

 On the integrable hierarchy for the resolved conifold	Murad Alim and Arpan Saha	None	None	We provide a direct proof of a conjecture of Brini relating the Gromov‚ÄìWitten theory of the resolved conifold to the Ablowitz‚ÄìLadik integrable hierarchy at the level of primaries. In doing so, we use a functional representation of the Ablowitz‚ÄìLadik hierarchy as well as a difference equation for the Gromov‚ÄìWitten potential. In particular, we express certain distinguished solutions of the difference equation in terms of an analytic function which is a specialization of a Tau function put forward by Bridgeland in the study of wall-crossing phenomena of Donaldson‚ÄìThomas invariants.

end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTLIGO, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA	The characterization of the Advanced LIGO detectors in the second and third observing runs has increased the sensitivity of the instruments, allowing for a higher number of detectable gravitational-wave signals, and provided confirmation of all observed gravitational-wave events. In this work, we present the methods used to characterize the LIGO detectors and curate the publicly available datasets, including the LIGO strain data and data quality products. We describe the essential role of these datasets in LIGO-Virgo Collaboration analyses of gravitational-waves from both transient and persistent sources and include details on the provenance of these datasets in order to support analyses of LIGO data by the broader community. Finally, we explain anticipated changes in the role of detector characterization and current efforts to prepare for the high rate of gravitational-wave alerts and events in future observing runs.	
 LS-HDIB: A Large Scale Handwritten Document Image Binarization Dataset			None	Handwritten document image binarization is challenging due to high variability in the written content and complex background attributes such as page style, paper quality, stains, shadow gradients, and non-uniform illumination. While the traditional thresholding methods do not effectively generalize on such challenging real-world scenarios, deep learning-based methods have performed relatively well when provided with sufficient training data. However, the existing datasets are limited in size and diversity. This work proposes LS-HDIB - a large-scale handwritten document image binarization dataset containing over a million document images that span numerous real-world scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique that uses a combination of adaptive thresholding and seamless cloning methods to create the dataset with accurate ground truths. Through an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation over eight different deep learning based models, we demonstrate the enhancement in the performance of these models when trained on the LS-HDIB dataset and tested on unseen images.

 Connecting the formation of stars and planets. II: coupling the angular momentum of stars with the angular momentum of planets	FlorTorres, Coziol, KP Schrder, Jack, and Schmitt, 	None	"L. M. Flor-Torres, R. Coziol, K.-P. Schr√∂der, D. Jack : Departamento de Astronom√≠a, Universidad de Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Gto, M√©xico.
J. H. M. M. Schmitt: Hamburger Sternwarte, Universit√§t Hamburg, "	A sample of 46 stars, host of exoplanets, is used to search for a connection between their formation process and the formation of the planets rotating around them. Separating our sample in two, stars hosting high-mass exoplanets (HMEs) and low-mass exoplanets (LMEs), we found the former to be more massive and to rotate faster than the latter. We also found the HMEs to have higher orbital angular momentum than the LMEs and to have lost more angular momentum through migration. These results are consistent with the view that the more massive the star and higher its rotation, the more massive was its protoplanetarys disk and rotation, and the more efficient the extraction of angular momentum from the planets.

We relate the geometry of Schubert varieties in twisted affine Grassmannian and the nilpotent varieties in symmetric spaces. This extends some results of Achar‚ÄìHenderson in the twisted setting. We also get some applications to the geometry of the order 2 nilpotent varieties in certain classical symmetric spaces.

 A reduction methodology for fluctuation driven population dynamics	Denis SGoldobin, Matteo di Volo, Alessandro Torcini	None	None	Lorentzian distributions have been largely employed in statistical mechanics to obtain exact results for heterogeneous systems. Analytic continuation of these results is impossible even for slightly deformed Lorentzian distributions, due to the divergence of all the moments (cumulants). We have solved this problem by introducing a pseudo-cumulants‚Äô expansion. This allows us to develop a reduction methodology for heterogeneous spiking neural networks subject to extrinsinc and endogenous noise sources, thus generalizing the mean-field formulation introduced in [E. Montbri√≥ et al. , Phys. Rev. X 5, 021028 (2015)].	
 High Resolution, Deep Imaging Using Confocal Time-of-flight Diffuse Optical Tomography	Yongyi Zhao, Ankit Raghuram, Hyun Kim, Andreas Hielscher,Jacob Robinson, and Ashok Veeraraghavan	None	None	Light scattering by tissue severely limits how deep beneath the surface one can image, and the spatial resolution one can obtain from these images. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is one of the most powerful techniques for imaging deep within tissue ‚Äì well beyond the conventional ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 10-15 mean scattering lengths tolerated by ballistic imaging techniques such as confocal and two-photon microscopy. Unfortunately, existing DOT systems are limited, achieving only centimeter-scale resolution. Furthermore, they suffer from slow acquisition times and slow reconstruction speeds making real-time imaging infeasible. We show that time-of-flight diffuse optical tomography (ToF-DOT) and its confocal variant (CToF-DOT), by exploiting the photon travel time information, allow us to achieve millimeter spatial resolution in the highly scattered diffusion regime ( > 50 absent 50 >50 > 50 mean free paths). In addition, we demonstrate two additional innovations: focusing on confocal measurements, and multiplexing the illumination sources allow us to significantly reduce the measurement acquisition time. Finally, we rely on a novel convolutional approximation that allows us to develop a fast reconstruction algorithm, achieving a 100 √ó \times √ó speedup in reconstruction time compared to traditional DOT reconstruction techniques. Together, we believe that these technical advances serve as the first step towards real-time, millimeter resolution, deep tissue imaging using DOT.	
 Artificial Intelligence Driven UAV-NOMA-MEC in Next Generation Wireless Networks	ZhongYang,MingzheChen,XiaoLiu,YuanweiLiu,YueChen,ShuguangCui,HVincentPoor	None	None	Driven by the unprecedented high throughput and low latency requirements in next generation wireless networks, this paper introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled framework in which unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) use non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and mobile edge computing (MEC) techniques to service terrestrial mobile users (MUs). The proposed framework enables the terrestrial MUs to offload their computational tasks simultaneously, intelligently, and flexibly, thus enhancing their connectivity as well as reducing their transmission latency and their energy consumption. To this end, the fundamentals of this framework are first introduced. Then, a number of communication and AI techniques are proposed to improve the quality of experiences of terrestrial MUs. To this end, federated learning and reinforcement learning are introduced for intelligent task offloading and computing resources allocation. For each learning technique, motivations, challenges, and representative results are introduced. Finally, several key technical challenges and open research issues of the proposed framework are summarized.	
 The AL-Gaussian Distribution as the Descriptive Model for the Internal Proactive Inhibition in the Standard Stop Signal Task	Mohsen Soltanifara, Michael Escobarb, Annie Dupuisc, Andre Chevrierdand Russell Schachare	None	None	Measurements of response inhibition components of reactive inhibition and proactive inhibition within the stop-signal paradigm have been of particular interest to researchers since the 1980s. While frequentist nonparametric and Bayesian parametric methods have been proposed to precisely estimate the entire distribution of reactive inhibition, quantified by stop signal reaction times(SSRT), there is no method yet in the stop-signal task literature to precisely estimate the entire distribution of proactive inhibition. We introduce an Asymmetric Laplace Gaussian (ALG) model to describe the distribution of proactive inhibition. The proposed method is based on two assumptions of independent trial type(go/stop) reaction times and Ex-Gaussian (ExG) models. Results indicated that the four parametric, ALG model uniquely describes the proactive inhibition distribution and its key shape features; and, its hazard function is monotonically increasing, as are its three parametric ExG components. In conclusion, both response inhibition components can be uniquely modeled via variations of the four parametric ALG model described with their associated similar distributional features.	
 Split-Douglas-Rachford algorithm for composite monotone inclusions and Split-ADMM	Luis BriceoArias Fernando Roldn	luis.briceno@usm.cl, fernando.roldan@usm.cl	Departamento de Matem√°tica, Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a, Avenida Espa√±a 1680, Valpara√≠so, Chile	In this paper we provide a generalization of the Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS) and the primal-dual algorithm [ 24 , 55 ] for solving monotone inclusions in a real Hilbert space involving a general linear operator. The proposed method allows for primal and dual non-standard metrics and activates the linear operator separately from the monotone operators appearing in the inclusion . I n the simplest case when the linear operator has full range , it reduces to classical DRS. Moreover, the weak convergence of primal-dual sequences to a Kuhn-Tucker point is guaranteed, generalizing the main result in [ 53 ] . Inspired by [ 34 ] , we also derive a new Split-ADMM (SADMM) by applying our method to the dual of a convex optimization problem involving a linear operator which can be expressed as the composition of two linear operators. The proposed SADMM activates one linear operator implicitly and the other one explicitly , and we recover ADMM when the latter is set as the identity. Connections and comparisons of our theoretical results with respect to the literature are provided for the main algorithm and SADMM . T he flexibility and efficiency of both methods is illustrated via a numerical simulations in total variation image restoration and a sparse minimization problem.	
 Hybrid Neural Pareto Front (HNPF): A Two-Stage Neural-Filter Approach for Pareto Front Extraction	, , , 	None	None	Pareto solutions represent optimal frontiers for jointly optimizing multiple competing objective functions over the feasible set of solutions satisfying imposed constraints. Extracting a Pareto front is computationally challenging today with limited scalability and solution accuracy. Popular generic scalarization approaches do not always converge to a global optimum and can only return one solution point per run. Consequently, multiple runs of a scalarization problem are required to guarantee a Pareto front, where all instances must converge to their respective global optima. We propose a robust, low cost hybrid Pareto neural-filter (HNPF) optimization approach that is accurate and scales (compute space and time) with data dimensions, and the number of functions and constraints. A first-stage neural network first efficiently extracts a weak Pareto front, using Fritz-John conditions as the discriminator, with no assumptions of convexity on the objectives or constraints. A second-stage, low-cost Pareto filter then extracts the strong Pareto optimal subset from the weak front. Fritz-John conditions provide strong theoretical bounds on approximation error between the true and the network extracted weak Pareto front. Numerical experiments demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of our approach.

 Strong In-plane Anisotropy in the Electronic Properties of Doped Transition Metal Dichalcogenides exhibited in W_{1-ùë•}Nb_ùë•S‚ÇÇ	Siow Mean Loh, Xue Xia, Neil Wilson, Nicholas Hine	s.loh@warwick.ac.uk	None	We study the electronic properties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide materials subjected to aliovalent doping, using Nb-doped WS 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT as an exemplar. Scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of the as-grown samples reveals an anisotropic Nb dopant distribution, prompting an investigation of anisotropy in electronic properties. Through electronic structure calculations on supercells representative of observed structures, we confirm that local Nb-atom distributions are consistent with energetic considerations, although kinetic processes occurring during sample growth must be invoked to explain the overall symmetry-breaking. We perform effective bandstructure and conductivity calculations on realistic models of the material that demonstrate that a high level of anisotropy can be expected in electronic properties including conductivity. In-plane anisotropy of the conductivity is predicted to be as high as 5:1, which is higher than previously observed in any TMDC system in the [Mo,W][S,Se] 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT class.

We plan to use the instrument to conduct the NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) over the course of the next 5 years, collecting hundreds of observations of some of the nearest and brightest stars in an effort to probe the regime of Earth-mass exoplanets. Even if we take advantage of the extreme instrumental precision conferred by NEID, it will remain difficult to disentangle the weak ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 10 cm s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ) signals induced by such low-mass, long-period exoplanets from stellar noise for all but the quietest host stars. In this work, we present a set of quantitative selection metrics which we use to identify an initial NETS target list consisting of stars conducive to the detection of exoplanets in the regime of interest. We also outline a set of observing strategies with which we aim to mitigate uncertainty contributions from intrinsic stellar variability and other sources of noise.	
 Proof.			None	We prove higher regularity for nonlinear nonlocal equations with possibly discontinuous coefficients of VMO-type in fractional Sobolev spaces. While for corresponding local elliptic equations with VMO coefficients it is only possible to obtain higher integrability, in our nonlocal setting we are able to also prove a substantial amount of higher differentiability, so that our result is in some sense of purely nonlocal type. By embedding, we also obtain higher H√∂lder regularity for such nonlocal equations.

 RGE effects on the LFV scale from meson decays	Marcela Gonzlez, Sergey Kovalenko, Nicols Neill, Jonatan Vignatti	None	None	We consider the lepton-flavor violating (LFV) lepton-quark dimension-6 operators and analyze their contributions to the LFV leptonic decays of vector, pseudoscalar, and scalar neutral mesons M ‚Üí ‚Ñì 1 ‚Ñì 2 ‚Üí ùëÄ subscript ‚Ñì 1 subscript ‚Ñì 2 M\to\ell_{1}\ell_{2} italic_M ‚Üí roman_‚Ñì start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_‚Ñì start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT as well as to Œº ( œÑ ) ‚Üí ‚Ñì e e , ‚Ñì Œ≥ Œ≥ ‚Üí ùúá ùúè ‚Ñì ùëí ùëí ‚Ñì ùõæ ùõæ \mu(\tau)\rightarrow\ell ee,\ell\gamma\gamma italic_Œº ( italic_œÑ ) ‚Üí roman_‚Ñì italic_e italic_e , roman_‚Ñì italic_Œ≥ italic_Œ≥ decays. These operators contribute to the purely leptonic processes via quark loop. On the basis of quark-hadron duality, we relate these loops to the appropriate meson-exchange contributions. In this way, we extract lower bounds on the individual scales of the studied LFV operators from the experimental and phenomenological limits on the leptonic decays of mesons and leptons. As a byproduct, we shall obtain new limits on the LFV leptonic decays of flavored mesons from the experimental bounds on the three-body lepton decays. We study the effects of QED and QCD radiative corrections to the LFV lepton-quark operators in question. We derive for them the one-loop matrix of the RGE evolution and examine its effect on the previously derived tree-level limits on these operators. We show that the QED corrections are particularly relevant due to operator mixing. Specifically, for some of them the limits on their individual LFV scales improve by up to 3 orders of magnitude.	
 Dopamine: Differentially Private Federated Learning on Medical Data	Mohammad Malekzadeh, Burak Hasircioglu, Nitish Mital, Kunal Katarya,Mehmet Emre Ozfatura, Deniz Gndz	None	None	While rich medical datasets are hosted in hospitals distributed across the world, concerns on patients‚Äô privacy is a barrier against using such data to train deep neural networks (DNNs) for medical diagnostics. We propose Dopamine , a system to train DNNs on distributed datasets, which employs federated learning (FL) with differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD), and, in combination with secure aggregation, can establish a better trade-off between differential privacy (DP) guarantee and DNN‚Äôs accuracy than other approaches. Results on a diabetic retinopathy (DR) task show that Dopamine provides a DP guarantee close to the centralized training counterpart, while achieving a better classification accuracy than FL with parallel DP where DPSGD is applied without coordination.

 Robust and Efficient Single-Pixel Image Classification with Nonlinear Optics	Santosh Kumar, Ting Bu, He Zhang, Irwin Huang, Yuping Huang	None	None	We present a hybrid image classifier by mode-selective image upconversion, single pixel photodetection, and deep learning, aiming at fast processing a large number of pixels. It utilizes partial Fourier transform to extract the signature features of images in both the original and Fourier domains, thereby significantly increasing the classification accuracy and robustness. Tested on the MNIST handwritten digit images, it boosts the accuracy from 81.25% to 99.23%, and achieves an 83% accuracy for highly contaminated images whose signal-to-noise ratio is only -17 dB. Our approach could prove useful for fast lidar data processing, high resolution image recognition, occluded target identification, atmosphere monitoring, and so on.	
 Quasi-phasematching in a poled Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier with three-wave mixing	Zorin	alexander.zorin@ptb.de	None	We develop the concept of quasi-phasematching (QPM) by implementing it in the recently proposed Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) with three-wave mixing (3WM).

 Large twisting angles in Bilayer graphene Moire quantum dot structures	Jozef Bucko, Frantiek Herman	None	None	Recent exploration of the commensurate structure in the turbostratic double layer graphene shows that the large angle twisting can be treated by the decrease of the effective velocity within the energy spectra of the single layer graphene. Within our work, we use this result as a starting point, aiming towards understanding the physics of by a large angle twisted double layer graphene (i.e. Moire) quantum dot systems. We show that within this simple approach using the language of the first quantization, yet another so far unrealized (not up to our knowledge), illustrative property of the commutation relation appears in the graphene physics. Intriguingly, large twisting angles show to be a suitable tunning knob of the position symmetry in the graphene systems. Complete overview of the large angle twisting on the considered dot systems is provided.	
 1 Introduction			None	Combinatorial Game Theory has also been called ‚Äòadditive game theory‚Äô, whenever the analysis involves sums of independent game components. Such disjunctive sums invoke comparison between games, which allows abstract values to be assigned to them. However, there are rulesets with entailing moves that break the alternating play axiom and/or restrict the other player‚Äôs options within the disjunctive sum components. These situations are exemplified in the literature by a ruleset such as nimstring , a normal play variation of the classical children‚Äôs game dots & boxes , and top entails , an elegant ruleset introduced in the classical work Winning Ways, by Berlekamp Conway and Guy. Such rulesets fall outside the scope of the established normal play theory. Here, we axiomatize normal play via two new terminating games, ‚àû {\boldsymbol{\infty}} bold_‚àû (Left wins) and ‚àû ¬Ø ¬Ø \overline{\infty} over¬Ø start_ARG ‚àû end_ARG (Right wins), and a more general theory is achieved. We define affine impartial , which extends classical impartial games, and we analyze their algebra by extending the established Sprague-Grundy theory, with an accompanying minimum excluded rule. Solutions of nimstring and top entails are given to illustrate the theory.	
 Eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator and the finite-time Lyapunov exponents in uniformly hyperbolic area-preserving maps	Kensuke Yoshida,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hajime YoshinostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Akira ShudostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Domenico LippolisstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	domenico@ujs.edu.cn	"11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Physics, Tokyo Metropolitan University,
Minami-Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan"	The subleading eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator for 2-dimensional area-preserving maps are numerically investigated. We closely examine the validity of the so-called Ulam method, a numerical scheme believed to provide eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator, both for linear and nonlinear maps on the torus. For the nonlinear case, the second-largest eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator are investigated by calculating the Fokker-Planck operator with sufficiently small diffusivity. On the basis of numerical schemes thus established, we find that eigenfunctions for the subleading eigenvalues exhibit spatially inhomogeneous patterns, especially showing localization around the region where unstable manifolds are sparsely running. Finally, such spatial patterns of the eigenfunction are shown to be very close to the distribution of the maximal finite-time Lyapunov exponents.	
 Better sampling in explanation methods can prevent dieselgate-like deception	Domen Vre, Marko RobnikikonjaUniversity of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information ScienceVena pot , Ljubljana, Slovenia	None	None	Machine learning models are used in many sensitive areas where, besides predictive accuracy, their comprehensibility is also important. Interpretability of prediction models is necessary to determine their biases and causes of errors and is a prerequisite for users‚Äô confidence. For complex state-of-the-art black-box models, post-hoc model-independent explanation techniques are an established solution. Popular and effective techniques, such as IME, LIME, and SHAP, use perturbation of instance features to explain individual predictions. Recently, Slack et al. ( 2020 ) put their robustness into question by showing that their outcomes can be manipulated due to poor perturbation sampling employed. This weakness would allow dieselgate type cheating of owners of sensitive models who could deceive inspection and hide potentially unethical or illegal biases existing in their predictive models. This could undermine public trust in machine learning models and give rise to legal restrictions on their use.	
 Unified Feature Extraction Framework based on Contrastive Learning	HongjieZhang, WenwenQiang, JinxinZhang,andLingJing	None	None	Feature extraction is an efficient approach for alleviating the issue of dimensionality in high-dimensional data. As a popular self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning has recently garnered considerable attention. In this study, we proposed a unified framework based on a new perspective of contrastive learning (CL) that is suitable for both unsupervised and supervised feature extraction. The proposed framework first constructed two CL graph for uniquely defining the positive and negative pairs. Subsequently, the projection matrix was determined by minimizing the contrastive loss function. In addition, the proposed framework considered both similar and dissimilar samples to unify unsupervised and supervised feature extraction. Moreover, we propose the three specific methods: unsupervised contrastive learning method, supervised contrastive learning method 1 ,and supervised contrastive learning method 2. Finally, the numerical experiments on five real datasets demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed framework in comparison to the existing methods.	
 A Case Study of Deep Learning Based Multi-Modal Methods for Predicting the Age-Suitability Rating of Movie Trailers	Mahsa Shafaei, Christos Smailis, Ioannis Kakadiaris, Thamar SolorioDepartment of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA	None	None	In this work, we explore different approaches to combine modalities for the problem of automated age-suitability rating of movie trailers. First, we introduce a new dataset containing videos of movie trailers in English downloaded from IMDB and YouTube, along with their corresponding age-suitability rating labels. Secondly, we propose a multi-modal deep learning pipeline addressing the movie trailer age suitability rating problem. This is the first attempt to combine video, audio, and speech information for this problem, and our experimental results show that multi-modal approaches significantly outperform the best mono and bimodal models in this task.

An ideal NLU system should process a language in a way that is not exclusive to a single task or a dataset. Keeping this in mind, we have introduced a novel knowledge driven semantic representation approach for English text. By leveraging the VerbNet lexicon, we are able to map syntax tree of the text to its commonsense meaning represented using basic knowledge primitives. The general purpose knowledge represented from our approach can be used to build any reasoning based NLU system that can also provide justification. We applied this approach to construct two NLU applications that we present here: SQuARE (Semantic-based Question Answering and Reasoning Engine) and StaCACK (Stateful Conversational Agent using Commonsense Knowledge). Both these systems work by ‚Äútruly understanding‚Äù the natural language text they process and both provide natural language explanations for their responses while maintaining high accuracy.	
 A Cable Knot and BPS-Series	John Chae	None	None	A series invariant of a complement of a knot was introduced recently. The invariant for several prime knots up to ten crossings have been explicitly computed. We present the first example of a satellite knot, namely, a cable of the figure eight knot, which has more than ten crossings. This cable knot result provides nontrivial evidence for the conjectures for the series invariant and demonstrates the robustness of integrality of the quantum invariant under the cabling operation. Furthermore, we observe a relation between the series invariant of the cable knot and the series invariant of the figure eight knot. This relation provides an alternative simple method of finding the former series invariant.	
 A new solution to the curved Ewald sphere problem for 3D image reconstruction in electron microscopy	Chen, Schmidt, Spence, Kirian	None	Department of PhysicsArizona State UniversityTempe, AZ 85287 USA	We develop an algorithm capable of imaging a three-dimensional object given a collection of two-dimensional images of that object that are significantly influenced by the curvature of the Ewald sphere. These two-dimensional images cannot be approximated as projections of the object. Such an algorithm is useful in cryo-electron microscopy where larger samples, higher resolution, or lower energy electron beams are desired, all of which contribute to the significance of Ewald curvature.	
 Tracking Short-Term Temporal Linguistic Dynamics to Characterize Candidate Therapeutics for COVID-19 in the CORD-19 Corpus	James Powell, Kari Sentz	jepowell@lanl.gov	None	Scientific literature tends to grow as a function of funding and interest in a given field. Mining such literature can reveal trends that may not be immediately apparent. The CORD-19 corpus represents a growing corpus of scientific literature associated with COVID-19. We examined the intersection of a set of candidate therapeutics identified in a drug-repurposing study with temporal instances of the CORD-19 corpus to determine if it was possible to find and measure changes associated with them over time. We propose that the techniques we used could form the basis of a tool to pre-screen new candidate therapeutics early in the research process.	
 Damage detection in operational wind turbine blades using a new approach based on machine learning	Kartik Chandrasekhar, Nevena Stevanovic, Elizabeth Cross, Nikolaos Dervilis, Keith Worden	k.chandrasekhar@sheffield.ac.uk	add2	The application of reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies to operational wind turbine blades is a challenging task, due to the uncertain nature of the environments they operate in. In this paper, a novel SHM methodology, which uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) is proposed. The methodology takes advantage of the fact that the blades on a turbine are nominally identical in structural properties and encounter the same environmental and operational variables (EOVs). The properties of interest are the first edgewise frequencies of the blades. The GPs are used to predict the edge frequencies of one blade given that of another, after these relationships between the pairs of blades have been learned when the blades are in a healthy state. In using this approach, the proposed SHM methodology is able to identify when the blades start behaving differently from one another over time. To validate the concept, the proposed SHM system is applied to real onshore wind turbine blade data, where some form of damage was known to have taken place. X-bar control chart analysis of the residual errors between the GP predictions and actual frequencies show that the system successfully identified early onset of damage as early as six months before it was identified and remedied.	
 Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Biopolymer Gels Using Neural Networks Trained on Discrete Fiber Network Data	Yue LengstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,, Sarah Calve,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Adrian Tepole,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTWeldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA22{}^{2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment 	Biopolymer gels, such as those made out of fibrin or collagen, are widely used in tissue engineering applications and biomedical research . Moreover, fibrin naturally assembles into gels in vivo during wound healing and thrombus formation. The macroscaole properties of fibrin and other biopolymer gels are dictated by the response of a microscale fiber network. Hence, accurate description of biopolymer gels can be achieved using representative volume elements (RVE) that explicitly model the discrete fiber networks of the microscale. These RVE models, however, cannot be efficiently used to model the macroscale due to the challenges and computational demands of multiscale coupling. Here, we propose the use of an artificial, fully connected neural network (FCNN) to efficiently capture the behavior of the RVE models. The FCNN was trained on 1100 fiber networks subjected to 121 biaxial deformations. The stress data from the RVE, together with the total energy on the fibers and the condition of incompressibility of the surrounding matrix, were used to determine the derivatives of an unknown strain energy function with respect to the deformation invariants. During training, the loss function was modified to ensure convexity of the strain energy function and symmetry of its Hessian. A general FCNN model was coded into a user material subroutine (UMAT) in the software Abaqus. The UMAT implementation takes in the structure and parameters of an arbitrary FCNN as material parameters from the input file. The inputs to the FCNN include the first two isochoric invariants of the deformation. The FCNN outputs the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the isochoric invariants. In this work, the FCNN trained on the discrete fiber network data was used in finite element simulations of biopolymer gels using our UMAT. We anticipate that this work will enable further integration of machine learning tools with computational mechanics. It will also improve computational modeling of biological materials characterized by a multiscale structure.

 1 Introduction			None	The memory capacity of embedding tables in deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) is increasing dramatically from tens of GBs to TBs across the industry. Given the fast growth in DLRMs, novel solutions are urgently needed, in order to enable fast and efficient DLRM innovations. At the same time, this must be done without having to exponentially increase infrastructure capacity demands. In this paper, we demonstrate the promising potential of Tensor Train decomposition for DLRMs (TT-Rec), an important yet under-investigated context. We design and implement optimized kernels (TT-EmbeddingBag) to evaluate the proposed TT-Rec design. TT-EmbeddingBag is 3 √ó \times √ó faster than the SOTA TT implementation. The performance of TT-Rec is further optimized with the batched matrix multiplication and caching strategies for embedding vector lookup operations. In addition, we present mathematically and empirically the effect of weight initialization distribution on DLRM accuracy and propose to initialize the tensor cores of TT-Rec following the sampled Gaussian distribution. We evaluate TT-Rec across three important design space dimensions‚Äîmemory capacity, accuracy, and timing performance‚Äîby training MLPerf-DLRM with Criteo‚Äôs Kaggle and Terabyte data sets. TT-Rec achieves 117 √ó \times √ó and 112 √ó \times √ó model size compression, for Kaggle and Terabyte, respectively. This impressive model size reduction can come with no accuracy nor training time overhead as compared to the uncompressed baseline.	
 Failure Prediction in Production Line Based on Federated Learning: An Empirical Study	Ning Ge, Guanghao Li, Li Zhang, Yi Liu	None	None	Data protection across organizations is limiting the application of centralized learning (CL) techniques. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to build a learning model without sharing data. Nevertheless, there is very few research works on FL in intelligent manufacturing. This paper presents the results of an empirical study on failure prediction in the production line based on FL. This paper (1) designs Federated Support Vector Machine (FedSVM) and Federated Random Forest (FedRF) algorithms for the horizontal FL and vertical FL scenarios, respectively; (2) proposes an experiment process for evaluating the effectiveness between the FL and CL algorithms; (3) finds that the performance of FL and CL are not significantly different on the global testing data, on the random partial testing data, and on the estimated unknown Bosch data, respectively. The fact that the testing data is heterogeneous enhances our findings. Our study reveals that FL can replace CL for failure prediction.	
 Disambiguating Symbolic Expressions in Informal Documents	Dennis MllerKnowledge Representation and ManagementFAU ErlangenNrnbergComputational LogicUniversity of InnsbruckCezary KaliszykComputational LogicUniversity of InnsbruckInstitute of Computer scienceWarsaw University	None	None	We propose the task of disambiguating symbolic expressions in informal STEM documents in the form of L A T E X files ‚Äì that is, determining their precise semantics and abstract syntax tree ‚Äì as a neural machine translation task. We discuss the distinct challenges involved and present a dataset with roughly 33,000 entries. We evaluated several baseline models on this dataset, which failed to yield even syntactically valid L A T E X before overfitting. Consequently, we describe a methodology using a transformer language model pre-trained on sources obtained from arxiv.org , which yields promising results despite the small size of the dataset. We evaluate our model using a plurality of dedicated techniques, taking the syntax and semantics of symbolic expressions into account.

 BOLD: Dataset and Metrics for Measuring Biases in Open-Ended Language Generation	Jwala Dhamala, Tony Sun, Varun Kumar, Satyapriya Krishna, Yada Pruksachatkun, KaiWei Chang, Rahul Gupta	None	None	Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled machines to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted with a sequence of words as context. While these models now empower many downstream applications from conversation bots to automatic storytelling, they have been shown to generate texts that exhibit social biases. To systematically study and benchmark social biases in open-ended language generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. We also propose new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation from multiple angles. An examination of text generated from three popular language models reveals that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social bias than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains. With these results we highlight the need to benchmark biases in open-ended language generation and caution users of language generation models on downstream tasks to be cognizant of these embedded prejudices.	
 Strongly localized wrinkling modes of single- and few-layer graphene sheets in or on a compliant matrix under compression	Yu Kosevich, Strelnikov	Corresponding author: yukosevich@gmail.com	None	We present a study of the wrinkling modes, localized in the plane of single- and few-layer graphene sheets embedded in or placed on a compliant compressively strained matrix. We provide the analytical model based on nonlinear elasticity of the graphene sheet, which shows that the compressive surface stress results in spatial localization of the extended sinusoidal wrinkling mode with soliton-like envelope with localization length, decreasing with the overcritical external strain. The parameters of the extended sinusoidal wrinkling modes are found from the conditions of anomalous softening of flexural surface acoustic wave propagating along the graphene sheet in or on the matrix. For relatively small overcritical external strain, the continuous transition occurs from the sinusoidal wrinkling modes with soliton-like envelope to the strongly localized modes with approximately one-period sinusoidal profiles and amplitude- and external-strain-independent spatial widths. Two types of graphene wrinkling modes with different symmetry are described, when the in-plane antisymmetric or symmetric modes are presumably realized in the graphene sheet embedded in or placed on a compliant strained matrix. Strongly localized wrinkling modes can be realized without delamination of the graphene sheet from the compliant matrix and are not equivalent to the ripplocations in layered solids. Molecular-dynamics modeling confirms the appearance of sinusoidal wrinkling modes in single- and few-layer graphene sheets embedded in polyethylene matrix at T = 300 K ùëá 300 ùêæ T=300K italic_T = 300 italic_K .	
 MiniV2G: An Electric Vehicle Charging Emulator	Luca Attanasio, Mauro Conti, Denis Donadel, Federico Turrin	luca.attanasio@studenti.unipd.it	None	The impact of global warming and the imperative to limit climate change have stimulated the need to develop new solutions based on renewable energy sources. One of the emerging trends in this endeavor are the Electric Vehicles (EVs), which use electricity instead of traditional fossil fuels as a power source, relying on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm. The novelty of such a paradigm requires careful analysis to avoid malicious attempts. An attacker can exploit several surfaces, such as the remote connection between the Distribution Grid and Charging Supply or the authentication system between the charging Supply Equipment and the Electric Vehicles. However, V2G architecture‚Äôs high cost and complexity in implementation can restrain this field‚Äôs research capability.

 Participatory Funding Coordination: Model, Axioms and Rules	Haris Aziz, Aditya Ganguly	None	None	We present a new model of collective decision making that captures important crowd-funding and donor coordination scenarios. In the setting, there is a set of projects (each with its own cost) and a set of agents (that have their budgets as well as preferences over the projects). An outcome is a set of projects that are funded along with the specific contributions made by the agents. For the model, we identify meaningful axioms that capture concerns including fairness, efficiency, and participation incentives. We then propose desirable rules for the model and study, which sets of axioms can be satisfied simultaneously. An experimental study indicates the relative performance of different rules as well as the price of enforcing fairness axioms.	
 Development of a PET/EPRI combined imaging system for assessing tumor hypoxia	Kim,, Epel, Sundramoorthy, HM Tsai, Barth, Gertsenshteyn, Halpern, Hua, Xie, CT Chen, CM Kao	None	None	Precise quantitative delineation of tumor hypoxia is essential in radiation therapy treatment planning to improve the treatment efficacy by targeting hypoxic sub-volumes. We developed a combined imaging system of positron emission tomography (PET) and electron para-magnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) of molecular oxygen to investigate the accuracy of PET imaging in assessing tumor hypoxia. The PET/EPRI combined imaging system aims to use EPRI to precisely measure the oxygen partial pressure in tissues. This will evaluate the validity of PET hypoxic tumor imaging by (near) simultaneously acquired EPRI as ground truth. The combined imaging system was constructed by integrating a small animal PET scanner (inner ring diameter 62 mm and axial field of view 25.6 mm) and an EPRI subsystem (field strength 25 mT and resonant frequency 700 MHz). The compatibility between the PET and EPRI subsystems were tested with both phantom and animal imaging. Hypoxic imaging on a tumor mouse model using 18 18 {}^{18} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 18 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT F-fluoromisonidazole radio-tracer was conducted with the developed PET/EPRI system. We report the development and initial imaging results obtained from the PET/EPRI combined imaging system.

 Characterising Fixed Parameter Tractability of Query Evaluation Over Guarded TGDs	Cristina Feier	None	None	We study the parameterized complexity of evaluating Ontology Mediated Queries (OMQs) based on Guarded TGDs (GTGDs) and Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs), in the case where relational symbols have unrestricted arity and where the parameter is the size of the OMQ. We establish exact criteria for fixed-parameter tractability (fpt) evaluation of recursively enumerable classes of such OMQs (under the widely held Exponential Time Hypothesis). One of the main technical tools introduced in the paper is an fpt-reduction from deciding parameterized uniform CSPs to parameterized OMQ evaluation. The reduction preserves measures which are known to be essential for classifying recursively enumerable classes of parameterized uniform CSPs: submodular width (according to the well known result of Marx for unrestricted-arity schemas) and treewidth (according to the well known result of Grohe for bounded-arity schemas). As such, it can be employed to obtain hardness results for evaluation of recursively enumerable classes of parameterized OMQs both in the unrestricted and in the bounded arity case. Previously, in the case of bounded arity schemas, this has been tackled using a technique requiring full introspection into the construction employed by Grohe.	
 SimBle - Introducing privacy preserving BLE simulation to generate real-world traces This work has been partially funded by the ANR MITIK project, French National Research Agency (ANR), PRC AAPG2019.).	, , , , , , , 	None	None	Bluetooth has become critical as many IoT devices are arriving in the market. Most of the current literature focusing on Bluetooth simulation concentrates on the network protocols‚Äô performances and completely neglects the privacy protection recommendations introduced in the BLE standard. Indeed, privacy protection is one of the main issues handled in the Bluetooth standard. For instance, the current standard forces devices to change the identifier they embed within the public and private packets, known as MAC address randomization. Although randomizing MAC addresses is intended to preserve device privacy, recent literature shows many challenges that are still present. One of them is the correlation between the public packets and the emitters. Unfortunately, existing evaluation tools such as NS-3 are not designed to reproduce this Bluetooth standard‚Äôs essential functionality. This makes it impossible to test solutions for different device-fingerprinting strategies as there is a lack of ground truth for large-scale scenarios with the majority of current BLE devices implementing MAC address randomization. In this paper, we first introduce a solution of standard-compliant MAC address randomization in the NS-3 framework, capable of emulating any real BLE device in the simulation and generating real-world Bluetooth traces. In addition, since the simulation run-time for trace-collection grows exponentially with the number of devices, we introduce an optimization to linearize public-packet sniffing. This made the large-scale trace-collection practically feasible. Then, we use the generated traces and associated ground truth to do a case study on the evaluation of a generic MAC address association available in the literature [ 1 ] . Our case study reveals that close to 90 % percent 90 90\% 90 % of randomized addresses could be correctly linked even in highly dense and mobile scenarios. This prompts the BLE standard to be revisited on privacy-related provisions. We provide privacy recommendations based on our case study. Finally, we discuss the consequences that real randomized traces bring to different scientific research domains and how our proposed solution helps in overcoming new challenges.	
 Neuromorphic computing with a single qudit	WDKalfus, GJRibeill, GERowlands, HKKrovi, TAOhki, LCGGovia	william.kalfus@yale.edu	None	Accelerating computational tasks with quantum resources is a widely-pursued goal that is presently limited by the challenges associated with high-fidelity control of many-body quantum systems. The paradigm of reservoir computing presents an attractive alternative, especially in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, since control over the internal system state and knowledge of its dynamics are not required. Instead, complex, unsupervised internal trajectories through a large state space are leveraged as a computational resource. Quantum systems offer a unique venue for reservoir computing, given the presence of interactions unavailable in analogous classical systems, and the potential for a computational space that grows exponentially with physical system size. Here, we consider a reservoir comprised of a single qudit ( d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional quantum system). We demonstrate a robust performance advantage compared to an analogous classical system accompanied by a clear improvement with Hilbert space dimension for two benchmark tasks: signal processing and short-term memory capacity. Qudit reservoirs are directly realized by current-era quantum hardware, offering immediate practical implementation, and a promising outlook for increased performance in larger systems.

 A Multi-Scale Conditional Deep Model for Tumor Cell Ratio Counting	Eric Cosatto, Kyle Gerard, HansPeter Graf, Maki Ogura, Tomoharu Kiyuna, Kanako Hatanaka, Yoshihiro Matsuno, Yutaka Hatanaka	None	None	We propose a method to accurately obtain the ratio of tumor cells over an entire histological slide. We use deep fully convolutional neural network models trained to detect and classify cells on images of H&E-stained tissue sections. Pathologists‚Äô labels consisting of exhaustive nuclei locations and tumor regions were used to trained the model in a supervised fashion. We show that combining two models, each working at a different magnification allows the system to capture both cell-level details and surrounding context to enable successful detection and classification of cells as either tumor-cell or normal-cell. Indeed, by conditioning the classification of a single cell on a multi-scale context information, our models mimic the process used by pathologists who assess cell neoplasticity and tumor extent at different microscope magnifications. The ratio of tumor cells can then be readily obtained by counting the number of cells in each class. To analyze an entire slide, we split it into multiple tiles that can be processed in parallel. The overall tumor cell ratio can then be aggregated. We perform experiments on a dataset of 100 slides with lung tumor specimens from both resection and tissue micro-array (TMA). We train fully-convolutional models using heavy data augmentation and batch normalization. On an unseen test set, we obtain an average mean absolute error on predicting the tumor cell ratio of less than 6%, which is significantly better than the human average of 20% and is key in properly selecting tissue samples for recent genetic panel tests geared at prescribing targeted cancer drugs. We perform ablation studies to show the importance of training two models at different magnifications and to justify the choice of some parameters, such as the size of the receptive field.

 Structures of bulk hexagonal post-transition-metal chalcogenides from dispersion-corrected density-functional theory	SJMagorrian, VZlyomi, NDDrummond	None	None	We use dispersion-corrected density-functional theory to determine the relative energies of competing polytypes of bulk layered hexagonal post-transition-metal chalcogenides, to search for the most stable structures of these potentially technologically important semiconductors. We show that there is some degree of consensus among dispersion-corrected exchange-correlation functionals regarding the energetic orderings of polytypes, but we find that for each material there are multiple stacking orders with relative energies of less than 1 meV per monolayer unit cell, implying that stacking faults are expected to be abundant in all post-transition-metal chalcogenides. By fitting a simple model to all our energy data, we predict that the most stable hexagonal structure has P 6 3 subscript 6 3 6_{3} 6 start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT /mmc space group in each case, but that the stacking order differs between GaS, GaSe, GaTe, and InS on the one hand and InSe and InTe on the other.

To detect this emission unambiguously, EXCLAIM will cross-correlate with a spectroscopic galaxy catalog. The EXCLAIM mission uses a cryogenic design to cool the telescope optics to approximately 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.7 K. The telescope features a 90 90 90 90 -cm primary mirror to probe spatial scales on the sky from the linear regime up to shot noise-dominated scales. The telescope optical elements couple to six ¬µ-Spec spectrometer modules, operating over a 420 420 420 420 ‚Äì 540 540 540 540 GHz frequency band with a spectral resolution of 512 512 512 512 and featuring microwave kinetic inductance detectors. A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) reads out the detectors in the baseline design. The cryogenic telescope and the sensitive detectors allow EXCLAIM to reach high sensitivity in spectral windows of low emission in the upper atmosphere. Here, an overview of the mission design and development status since the start of the EXCLAIM project in early 2019 is presented.	
 Wave Dark Matter	Lam Hui	None	None	We review the physics and phenomenology of wave dark matter: a bosonic dark matter candidate lighter than about 30 30 30 30 eV. Such particles have a de Broglie wavelength exceeding the average inter-particle separation in a galaxy like the Milky Way, thus well described as a set of classical waves. We outline the particle physics motivations for them, including the QCD axion as well as ultra-light axion-like-particles such as fuzzy dark matter. The wave nature of the dark matter implies a rich phenomenology:

We describe the DESI Sky Continuum Monitor System, which tracks the night sky brightness as part of a system that dynamically adjusts the spectroscopic exposure time to produce more uniform data quality and to maximize observing efficiency. The DESI dynamic exposure time calculator (ETC) will combine sky brightness measurements from the Sky Monitor with data from the guider system to calculate the exposure time to achieve uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the spectra under various observing conditions. The DESI design includes 20 sky fibers, and these are split between two identical Sky Monitor units to provide redundancy. Each Sky Monitor unit uses an SBIG STXL-6303e CCD camera and supports an eight-position filter wheel. Both units have been completed and delivered to the Mayall Telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Commissioning results show that the Sky Monitor delivers the required performance necessary for the ETC.	
 Linearized theory of the fluctuation dynamics in 2D topological lasers	Aurelian LoirettePelous, Ivan Amelio, Matteo Secl, Iacopo Carusotto	None	None	We theoretically study the collective excitation modes of a topological laser device operating in a single-mode steady-state with monochromatic emission. We consider a model device based on a two-dimensional photonic Harper-Hofstadter lattice including a broadband gain medium localized on the system edge. Different regimes are considered as a function of the value of the optical nonlinearity and of the gain relaxation time. The dispersion of the excitation modes is calculated via a full two-dimensional Bogoliubov approach and physically interpreted in terms of an effective one-dimensional theory. Depending on the system parameters, various possible physical processes leading to dynamical instabilities are identified and characterized. On this basis, strategies to enforce a stable single-mode topological laser operation are finally pointed out .	
 Probabilistic Error Analysis For Sequential Summation of Real Floating Point NumbersFunding: This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation grant DMS-1760374.	Johnathan Rhyne	None	None	We propose probabilistic models to bound the forward error in the numerically computed sum of a vector with n ùëõ n italic_n real elements. To do so, we generate our own deterministic bound for ease of comparison, and then create a model of our errors to generate probabilistic bounds of a comparable structure that can typically be computed alongside the actual computation of the sum. The errors are represented as bounded, independent, zero-mean random variables. We have found that our accuracy is increased when we use vectors that do not sum to zero. This accuracy reaches to be within 1 order of magnitude when all elements are of the same sign. We also show that our bounds are informative for most cases of IEEE half precision and all cases of single precision numbers for a for a vector of dimension, n ‚â§ 10 7 ùëõ superscript 10 7 n\leq 10^{7} italic_n ‚â§ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Our numerical experiments confirm that the probabilistic bounds are tighter by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude than their deterministic counterparts for dimensions of at least 80 with extremely small failure probabilities. The experiments also confirm that our bounds are much more accurate for vectors consisting of elements of the same sign.	
 Compositionality Through Language Transmission, using Artificial Neural Networks	ASAPP httpsasappcom World Trade Center, NY USA	None	None	We propose an architecture and process for using the Iterated Learning Model (‚ÄùILM‚Äù) for artificial neural networks. We show that ILM does not lead to the same clear compositionality as observed using DCGs, but does lead to a modest improvement in compositionality, as measured by holdout accuracy and topologic similarity. We show that ILM can lead to an anti-correlation between holdout accuracy and topologic rho. We demonstrate that ILM can increase compositionality when using non-symbolic high-dimensional images as input.	
 Convergence Analysis of Fixed Point Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow Problems	Johannes JBrust, andMihaiAnitescu,Member,IEEE	None	None	For optimal power flow problems with chance constraints, a particularly effective method is based on a fixed point iteration applied to a sequence of deterministic power flow problems. However, a priori, the convergence of such an approach is not necessarily guaranteed. This article analyses the convergence conditions for this fixed point approach, and reports numerical experiments including for large IEEE networks.	
 \textmugreek-Spec Spectrometers for the EXCLAIM Instrument	Mona Mirzaei, Emily Barrentine, Berhanu Bulcha, Giuseppe Cataldo, Jake Connors, Negar Ehsan, Thomas EssingerHileman, Larry Hess, Jonas MuggeDurum, Omid Noroozian, Trevor Oxholm, Thomas Stevenson, Eric Switzer, Carolyn Volpert, Edward Wollack	None	None	The EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM) is a cryogenic balloon-borne instrument that will map carbon monoxide and singly-ionized carbon emission lines across redshifts from 0 to 3.5, using an intensity mapping approach. EXCLAIM will broaden our understanding of these elemental and molecular gases, and the role they play in star formation processes across cosmic time scales. The focal plane of EXCLAIM‚Äôs cryogenic telescope features six \textmugreek -Spec spectrometers. \textmugreek -Spec is a compact, integrated grating-analog spectrometer, which uses meandered superconducting niobium microstrip transmission lines on a single-crystal silicon dielectric to synthesize the grating. It features superconducting aluminum microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), also in a microstrip architecture. The spectrometers for EXCLAIM couple to the telescope optics via a hybrid planar antenna coupled to a silicon lenslet. The spectrometers operate from 420 420 420 420 ‚Äì 540 540 540 540 GHz with a resolving power R = Œª / Œî Œª = 512 ùëÖ ùúÜ Œî ùúÜ 512 R=\lambda/\Delta\lambda=512 italic_R = italic_Œª / roman_Œî italic_Œª = 512 , and employ an array of 355 MKIDs on each spectrometer.

 Automated femur segmentation from computed tomography images using a deep neural network	PA BjornssonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Helgason, Palsson, Sigurdsson, Gudnason, LM Ellingsen	None	None	Osteoporosis is a common bone disease that occurs when the creation of new bone does not keep up with the loss of old bone, resulting in increased fracture risk. Adults over the age of 50 are especially at risk and see their quality of life diminished because of limited mobility, which can lead to isolation and depression. We are developing a robust screening method capable of identifying individuals predisposed to hip fracture to address this clinical challenge. The method uses finite element analysis and relies on segmented computed tomography (CT) images of the hip. Presently, the segmentation of the proximal femur requires manual input, which is a tedious task, prone to human error, and severely limits the practicality of the method in a clinical context. Here we present a novel approach for segmenting the proximal femur that uses a deep convolutional neural network to produce accurate, automated, robust, and fast segmentations of the femur from CT scans. The network architecture is based on the renowned u-net, which consists of a downsampling path to extract increasingly complex features of the input patch and an upsampling path to convert the acquired low resolution image into a high resolution one. Skipped connections allow us to recover critical spatial information lost during downsampling. The model was trained on 30 manually segmented CT images and was evaluated on 200 ground truth manual segmentations. Our method delivers a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and \nth 95 percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 0.990 0.990 0.990 0.990 and 0.981 0.981 0.981 0.981 mm, respectively.	
 Not Now, Ask Later: Users Weaken Their Behavior Change Regimen Over Time, But Expect To Re-Strengthen It Imminently	Geza Kovacs, Zhengxuan Wu, Michael Bernstein	None	None	How effectively do we adhere to nudges and interventions that help us control our online browsing habits? If we have a temporary lapse and disable the behavior change system, do we later resume our adherence, or has the dam broken? In this paper, we investigate these questions through log analyses of 8,000+ users on HabitLab, a behavior change platform that helps users reduce their time online. We find that, while users typically begin with high-challenge interventions, over time they allow themselves to slip into easier and easier interventions. Despite this, many still expect to return to the harder interventions imminently: they repeatedly choose to be asked to change difficulty again on the next visit, declining to have the system save their preference for easy interventions.	
 On the mapping between Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines	Matthew SmartDepartment of PhysicsUniversity of TorontoAnton ZilmanDepartment of Physicsand Institute for Biomedical EngingeeringUniversity of Toronto	None	None	Hopfield networks (HNs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are two important models at the interface of statistical physics, machine learning, and neuroscience. Recently, there has been interest in the relationship between HNs and RBMs, due to their similarity under the statistical mechanics formalism. An exact mapping between HNs and RBMs has been previously noted for the special case of orthogonal (‚Äúuncorrelated‚Äù) encoded patterns. We present here an exact mapping in the case of correlated pattern HNs, which are more broadly applicable to existing datasets. Specifically, we show that any HN with N ùëÅ N italic_N binary variables and p < N ùëù ùëÅ p<N italic_p < italic_N arbitrary binary patterns can be transformed into an RBM with N ùëÅ N italic_N binary visible variables and p ùëù p italic_p gaussian hidden variables. We outline the conditions under which the reverse mapping exists, and conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset which suggest the mapping provides a useful initialization to the RBM weights. We discuss extensions, the potential importance of this correspondence for the training of RBMs, and for understanding the performance of deep architectures which utilize RBMs.	
 FIRe-GAN: A novel Deep Learning-based infrared-visible fusion method for wildfire imagery This research is supported in part by Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey and the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT). This research is part of the project 7817-2019 funded by the Jalisco State Council of Science and Technology (COECYTJAL).	CiprinSnchez, OchoaRuiz, GonzalezMendoza, Rossi	None	None	Early wildfire detection is of paramount importance to avoid as much damage as possible to the environment, properties, and lives. Deep Learning (DL) models that can leverage both visible and infrared information have the potential to display state-of-the-art performance, with lower false-positive rates than existing techniques. However, most DL-based image fusion methods have not been evaluated in the domain of fire imagery. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no publicly available dataset contains visible-infrared fused fire images. There is a growing interest in DL-based image fusion techniques due to their reduced complexity. Due to the latter, we select three state-of-the-art, DL-based image fusion techniques and evaluate them for the specific task of fire image fusion. We compare the performance of these methods on selected metrics. Finally, we also present an extension to one of the said methods, that we called FIRe-GAN , that improves the generation of artificial infrared images and fused ones on selected metrics.

We have identify numerous signatures of gas disruption. The elongated and multi-core structure of Complex A indicates that either thermodynamic instabilities or shock-cascade processes have fragmented this stream.

On the high-latitude side of the complex, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities have generated two large wings that extend tangentially off Complex A. The tips of these wings curve slightly forward in the direction of motion and have an elevated H i column density, indicating that these wings are forming Rayleigh-Taylor globules at their tips and that this gas is becoming entangled with unseen vortices in the surrounding coronal gas.

 References			None	In this paper, we propose a mixed-precision convolution unit architecture which supports different integer and floating point (FP) precisions. The proposed architecture is based on low-bit inner product units and realizes higher precision based on temporal decomposition. We illustrate how to integrate FP computations on integer-based architecture and evaluate overheads incurred by FP arithmetic support. We argue that alignment and addition overhead for FP inner product can be significant since the maximum exponent difference could be up to 58 bits, which results into a large alignment logic. To address this issue, we illustrate empirically that no more than 26-bit product bits are required and up to 8-bit of alignment is sufficient in most inference cases. We present novel optimizations based on the above observations to reduce the FP arithmetic hardware overheads. Our empirical results, based on simulation and hardware implementation, show significant reduction in FP16 overhead. Over typical mixed precision implementation, the proposed architecture achieves area improvements of up to 25% in TFLOPS/ m m 2 ùëö superscript ùëö 2 mm^{2} italic_m italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and up to 46% in TOPS/ m m 2 ùëö superscript ùëö 2 mm^{2} italic_m italic_m start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT with power efficiency improvements of up to 40% in TFLOPS/W and up to 63% in TOPS/W.

 Information contraction in noisy binary neural networks and its implications	ChutengZhou,QuntaoZhuang,MatthewMattina,andPaulNWhatmough	None	None	Neural networks have gained importance as the machine learning models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale image classification, object detection and natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we consider noisy binary neural networks, where each neuron has a non-zero probability of producing an incorrect output. These noisy models may arise from biological, physical and electronic contexts and constitute an important class of models that are relevant to the physical world. Intuitively, the number of neurons in such systems has to grow to compensate for the noise while maintaining the same level of expressive power and computation reliability. Our key finding is a lower bound for the required number of neurons in noisy neural networks, which is first of its kind. To prove this lower bound, we take an information theoretic approach and obtain a novel strong data processing inequality (SDPI), which not only generalizes the Evans-Schulman results for binary symmetric channels to general channels, but also improves the tightness drastically when applied to estimate end-to-end information contraction in networks. Our SDPI can be applied to various information processing systems, including neural networks and cellular automata. Applying the SDPI in noisy binary neural networks, we obtain our key lower bound and investigate its implications on network depth-width trade-offs, our results suggest a depth-width trade-off for noisy neural networks that is very different from the established understanding regarding noiseless neural networks. Furthermore, we apply the SDPI to study fault-tolerant cellular automata and obtain bounds on the error correction overheads and the relaxation time. This paper offers new understanding of noisy information processing systems through the lens of information theory.	
 Faster Kernel Interpolation for Gaussian Processes	Mohit Yadav, Daniel Sheldon, Cameron MuscoUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst	None	None	A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n √ó n ùëõ ùëõ n\times n italic_n √ó italic_n kernel matrix, where n ùëõ n italic_n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m ùëö m italic_m ‚Äúinducing points‚Äù. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of ùí™ ( n + m log ‚Å° m ) ùí™ ùëõ ùëö ùëö \mathcal{O}(n+m\log m) caligraphic_O ( italic_n + italic_m roman_log italic_m ) for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n ùëõ n italic_n enables inference for very large data sets; however the cost is per-iteration , which remains a limitation for extremely large n ùëõ n italic_n . We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced to ùí™ ( m log ‚Å° m ) ùí™ ùëö ùëö \mathcal{O}(m\log m) caligraphic_O ( italic_m roman_log italic_m ) after a single ùí™ ( n ) ùí™ ùëõ \mathcal{O}(n) caligraphic_O ( italic_n ) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m ùëö m italic_m compact basis functions. With per-iteration complexity independent of the dataset size n ùëõ n italic_n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m ùëö m italic_m and n ùëõ n italic_n and apply the method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over 100 million points.

 PROTODA: EFFICIENT TRANSFER LEARNING FOR FEW-SHOT INTENT CLASSIFICATION			None	Practical sequence classification tasks in natural language processing often suffer from low training data availability for target classes. Recent works towards mitigating this problem have focused on transfer learning using embeddings pre-trained on often unrelated tasks, for instance, language modeling. We adopt an alternative approach by transfer learning on an ensemble of related tasks using prototypical networks under the meta-learning paradigm. Using intent classification as a case study, we demonstrate that increasing variability in training tasks can significantly improve classification performance. Further, we apply data augmentation in conjunction with meta-learning to reduce sampling bias. We make use of a conditional generator for data augmentation that is trained directly using the meta-learning objective and simultaneously with prototypical networks, hence ensuring that data augmentation is customized to the task. We explore augmentation in the sentence embedding space as well as prototypical embedding space. Combining meta-learning with augmentation provides upto 6.49% and 8.53% relative F1-score improvements over the best performing systems in the 5-shot and 10-shot learning, respectively.

 A note on tight projective 2-designs	JosephWIverson, EmilyJKing, DustinGMixon	None	None	We study tight projective 2 2 2 2 -designs in three different settings. In the complex setting, Zauner‚Äôs conjecture predicts the existence of a tight projective 2 2 2 2 -design in every dimension. Pandey, Paulsen, Prakash, and Rahaman recently proposed an approach to make quantitative progress on this conjecture in terms of the entanglement breaking rank of a certain quantum channel. We show that this quantity is equal to the size of the smallest weighted projective 2 2 2 2 -design. Next, in the finite field setting, we introduce a notion of projective 2 2 2 2 -designs, we characterize when such projective 2 2 2 2 -designs are tight, and we provide a construction of such objects.

 Detecting Hidden Layers from Spreading Dynamics on Complex Networks	ukasz Gajewski, Jan Chooniewski, Mateusz Wilinski	lukaszgajewski@tuta.io	None	When dealing with spreading processes on networks it can be of the utmost importance to test the reliability of data and identify potential unobserved spreading paths. In this paper we address these problems and propose methods for hidden layer identification and reconstruction. We also explore the interplay between difficulty of the task and the structure of the multilayer network describing the whole system where the spreading process occurs. Our methods stem from an exact expression for the likelihood of a cascade in the Susceptible-Infected model on an arbitrary graph. We then show that by imploring statistical properties of unimodal distributions and simple heuristics describing joint likelihood of a series of cascades one can obtain an estimate of both existence of a hidden layer and its content with success rates far exceeding those of a null model. We conduct our analyses on both synthetic and real-world networks providing evidence for the viability of the approach presented.	
 Regularity of the singular set in the fully nonlinear obstacle problem	Ovidiu Savin, Hui Yu, Ovidiu Savin, Hui Yu	savin@math.columbia.edu	Department of Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, USA	We revisit and sharpen the results from our previous work, where we investigated the regularity of the singular set of the free boundary in the nonlinear obstacle problem. As in the work of Figalli-Serra on the classical obstacle problem, we show that each stratum can be further decomposed into a ‚Äògood‚Äô part and an ‚Äòanomalous‚Äô part, where the former is covered by C 1 , 1 ‚àí superscript ùê∂ 1 limit-from 1 C^{1,1-} italic_C start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 , 1 - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT manifolds, and the latter is of lower dimension.	
 An Overview of Machine Learning Techniques for Radiowave Propagation Modeling	Aristeidis Seretis, Costas Sarris	None	None	We give an overview of recent developments in the modeling of radiowave propagation, based on machine learning algorithms. We identify the input and output specification and the architecture of the model as the main challenges associated with machine learning-driven propagation models. Relevant papers are discussed and categorized based on their approach to each of these challenges. Emphasis is given on presenting the prospects and open problems in this promising and rapidly evolving area.	
 Percolation on complex networks: Theory and application	Ming Li, RunRan Liu, Linyuan, MaoBin Hu, Shuqi Xu, YiCheng Zhang	None	Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, P. R. China	In the last two decades, network science has blossomed and influenced various fields, such as statistical physics, computer science, biology and sociology, from the perspective of the heterogeneous interaction patterns of components composing the complex systems. As a paradigm for random and semi-random connectivity, percolation model plays a key role in the development of network science and its applications. On the one hand, the concepts and analytical methods, such as the emergence of the giant cluster, the finite-size scaling, and the mean-field method, which are intimately related to the percolation theory, are employed to quantify and solve some core problems of networks. On the other hand, the insights into the percolation theory also facilitate the understanding of networked systems, such as robustness, epidemic spreading, vital node identification, and community detection. Meanwhile, network science also brings some new issues to the percolation theory itself, such as percolation of strong heterogeneous systems, topological transition of networks beyond pairwise interactions, and emergence of a giant cluster with mutual connections. So far, the percolation theory has already percolated into the researches of structure analysis and dynamic modeling in network science. Understanding the percolation theory should help the study of many fields in network science, including the still opening questions in the frontiers of networks, such as networks beyond pairwise interactions, temporal networks, and network of networks. The intention of this paper is to offer an overview of these applications, as well as the basic theory of percolation transition on network systems.	
 On the Performance of Large-Scale Wireless Networks in the Finite Block-Length Regime	Nourhan Hesham and Anas Chaaban	None	None	Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications have stringent delay constraints, and hence use codes with small block length (short codewords). In these cases, classical models that provide good approximations to systems with infinitely long codewords become imprecise. To remedy this, in this paper, an average coding rate expression is derived for a large-scale network with short codewords using stochastic geometry and the theory of coding in the finite blocklength regime. The average coding rate and upper and lower bounds on the outage probability of the large-scale network are derived, and a tight approximation of the outage probability is presented. Then, simulations are presented to study the effect of network parameters on the average coding rate and the outage probability of the network, which demonstrate that results in the literature derived for the infinite blocklength regime overestimate the network performance, whereas the results in this paper provide a more realistic performance evaluation.	
 1 Introduction			None	This paper presents a fast first-order method for solving the quasi-static contact problem with the Coulomb friction. It is known that this problem can be formulated as a second-order cone linear complementarity problem, for which regularized or semi-smooth Newton methods are widely used. As an alternative approach, this paper develops a method based on an accelerated primal-dual algorithm. The proposed method is easy to implement, as most of computation consists of additions and multiplications of vectors and matrices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms a regularized and smoothed Newton method for second-order cone complementarity problems.	
 Tripartite Entanglement of Hawking Radiation in Dispersive Model	Yasusada Nambu, Yuki Osawa	nambu@gravity.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp	None	We investigate entanglement of the Hawking radiation in a dispersive model with subluminal dispersion. In this model, feature of the Hawking radiation is represented by three mode Bogoliubov transformation connecting the in-vacuum state and the out-state. We obtain the exact form of the tripartite in-vacuum state which encodes structure of multipartite entanglement. Bogoliubov coefficients are computed by numerical calculation of the wave equation with subluminal dispersion and it is found that genuine tripartite entanglement persists in whole frequency range up to the cutoff arisen from the subluminal dispersion. In the low frequency region, amount of the tripartite entanglement is far small compared to bipartite entanglement between the Hawking particle and its partner mode, and the deviation from the thermal spectrum is negligible. On the other hand, in the high frequency region near the cutoff, entanglement of the system is equally shared by two pairs of three modes, and the thermal nature of the Hawking radiation is lost.	
 A fractional model for anomalous diffusion with increased variability. Analysis, algorithms and applications to interface problems	Marta DElia, Christian Glusa	mdelia@sandia.gov	None	Fractional equations have become the model of choice in several applications where heterogeneities at the microstructure result in anomalous diffusive behavior at the macroscale. In this work we introduce a new fractional operator characterized by a doubly-variable fractional order and possibly truncated interactions. Under certain conditions on the model parameters and on the regularity of the fractional order we show that the corresponding Poisson problem is well-posed. We also introduce a finite element discretization and describe an efficient implementation of the finite-element matrix assembly in the case of piecewise constant fractional order. Through several numerical tests, we illustrate the improved descriptive power of this new operator across media interfaces. Furthermore, we present one-dimensional and two-dimensional h ‚Ñé h italic_h -convergence results that show that the variable-order model has the same convergence behavior as the constant-order model.	
 Improving neural network robustness through neighborhood preserving layers	Bingyuan Liu,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Christopher MalonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Lingzhou XuestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Erik KruusstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTNEC Laboratories America, Inc,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTPennsylvania State University	None	None	Robustness against adversarial attack in neural networks is an important research topic in the machine learning community. We observe one major source of vulnerability of neural nets is from overparameterized fully-connected layers. In this paper, we propose a new neighborhood preserving layer which can replace these fully connected layers to improve the network robustness. We demonstrate a novel neural network architecture which can incorporate such layers and also can be trained efficiently. We theoretically prove that our models are more robust against distortion because they effectively control the magnitude of gradients. Finally, we empirically show that our designed network architecture is more robust against state-of-art gradient descent based attacks, such as a PGD attack on the benchmark datasets MNIST and CIFAR10.

 Long-ranged velocity correlations in dense systems of self-propelled particles	Grzegorz Szamel, Elijah Flenner	grzegorz.szamel@colostate.edu	None	Model systems of self-propelled particles reproduce many phenomena observed in laboratory active matter systems that defy our thermal equilibrium-based intuition. In particular, in stationary states of self-propelled systems, it is recognized that velocities of different particles exhibit non-trivial equal-time correlations. Such correlations are absent in equivalent equilibrium systems. Recently, researchers found that the range of the velocity correlations increases with increasing persistence time of the self-propulsion and can extend over many particle diameters. Here we review the initial studies of long-ranged velocity correlations in solid-like systems of self-propelled particles. Then, we demonstrate that the long-ranged velocity correlations are also present in dense fluid-like systems. We show that the range of velocity correlations in dense systems of self-propelled particles is determined by the combination of the self-propulsion and the virial bulk modulus that originates from repulsive interparticle interactions.	
 1 INTRODUCTION			None	Organ transplantation is often the last resort for treating end-stage illness, but the probability of a successful transplantation depends greatly on compatibility between donors and recipients. Current medical practice relies on coarse rules for donor-recipient matching, but is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex factors underlying organ compatibility. In this paper, we formulate the problem of learning data-driven rules for organ matching using observational data for organ allocations and transplant outcomes. This problem departs from the standard supervised learning setup in that it involves matching the two feature spaces (i.e., donors and recipients), and requires estimating transplant outcomes under counterfactual matches not observed in the data. To address these problems, we propose a model based on representation learning to predict donor-recipient compatibility; our model learns representations that cluster donor features, and applies donor-invariant transformations to recipient features to predict outcomes for a given donor-recipient feature instance. Experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-art allocation methods and policies executed by human experts.	
 Performance Analysis and Window Design for Channel Estimation of OTFS Modulation	Zhiqiang Wei, Weijie Yuan, Shuangyang Li, Jinhong Yuan, and Derrick Wing Kwan Ng	None	None	In this paper, we investigate the impacts of transmitter and receiver windows on orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation and propose a window design to improve the OTFS channel estimation performance. Assuming ideal pulse shaping filters at the transceiver, we first identify the role of window in effective channel and the reduced channel sparsity with conventional rectangular window. Then, we characterize the impacts of windowing on the effective channel estimation performance for OTFS modulation. Based on the revealed insights, we propose to apply a Dolph-Chebyshev (DC) window at either the transmitter or the receiver to effectively enhance the sparsity of the effective channel. As such, the channel spread due to the fractional Doppler is significantly reduced, which leads to a lower error floor in channel estimation compared with that of the rectangular window. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the obtained analytical results and confirm the superiority of the proposed window designs in improving the channel estimation performance over the conventional rectangular or Sine windows.	
 Resolvent analysis of stratification effects on wall-bounded shear flows	Ahmed, Bae, Thompson, McKeon	arslan@caltech.edu	None	The interaction between shear driven turbulence and stratification is a key process in a wide array of geophysical flows with spatio-temporal scales that span many orders of magnitude. A quick numerical model prediction based on external parameters of stratified boundary layers could greatly benefit the understanding of the interaction between velocity and scalar flux at varying scales. For these reasons, here, we use the resolvent framework [ 1 ] to investigate the effects of an active scalar on incompressible wall-bounded turbulence. We obtain the state of the flow system by applying the linear resolvent operator to the nonlinear terms in the governing Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation. This extends the formulation to include the scalar advection equation with the scalar component acting in the wall-normal direction in the momentum equations [ 2 ] . We use the mean velocity profiles from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a stably-stratified turbulent channel flow at varying friction Richardson number R i œÑ ùëÖ subscript ùëñ ùúè Ri_{\tau} italic_R italic_i start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÑ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . The results obtained from the resolvent analysis are compared to the premultiplied energy spectra, auto-correlation coefficient, and the energy budget terms obtained from the DNS. It is shown that despite using only a very limited range of representative scales, the resolvent model is able to reproduce the balance of energy budget terms as well as provide meaningful insight of coherent structures occurring in the flow. Computation of the leading resolvent models, despite considering a limited range of scales, reproduces the balance of energy budget terms, provides meaningful predictions of coherent structures in the flow, and is more cost-effective than performing full-scale simulations. This quick model can provide further understanding of stratified flows with only information about the mean profile and prior knowledge of energetic scales of motion in the neutrally-buoyant boundary layers.

We discuss the problem of unique determination of the finite free discrete Schr√∂dinger operator from its spectrum, also known as Ambarzumian problem, with various boundary conditions, namely any real constant boundary condition at zero and Floquet boundary conditions of any angle. Then we prove the following Ambarzumian-type mixed inverse spectral problem: Diagonal entries except the first and second ones and a set of two consecutive eigenvalues uniquely determine the finite free discrete Schr√∂dinger operator.	
 Solid-state Tube Wakefield Accelerator using Surface Waves in Crystals	Aakash Sahai, Toshiki Tajima, Peter Taborek, Vladimir Shiltsev	None	None	Solid-state or crystal acceleration has for long been regarded as an attractive frontier in advanced particle acceleration. However, experimental investigations of solid-state acceleration mechanisms which offer TVm ‚àí 1 superscript TVm 1 \rm TVm^{-1} roman_TVm start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT acceleration gradients have been hampered by several technological constraints. The primary constraint has been the unavailability of attosecond particle or photon sources suitable for excitation of collective modes in bulk crystals. Secondly, there are significant difficulties with direct high-intensity irradiation of bulk solids, such as beam instabilities due to crystal imperfections and collisions etc.	
 Moral and Social Ramifications of Autonomous Vehicles	Veljko Dubljevi, Sean Douglas, Jovan Milojevich, Nirav Ajmeri, William ABauer, George FList, Munindar PSingh	veljkoÀôdubljevic@ncsu.edu	None	Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) raise important social and ethical concerns, especially about accountability, dignity, and justice. We focus on the specific concerns arising from how AV technology will affect the lives and livelihoods of professional and semi-professional drivers. Whereas previous studies of such concerns have focused on the opinions of experts, we seek to understand these ethical and societal challenges from the perspectives of the drivers themselves.	
 Lunar Cratering Asymmetries with High Orbital Obliquity and Inclination of the Moon	Huacheng Li, Nan Zhang, Zongyu Yue, Yizhuo Zhang	None	None	Accurate estimation of cratering asymmetry on the Moon is crucial for understanding Moon evolution history. Early studies of cratering asymmetry have omitted the contributions of high lunar obliquity and inclination. Here, we include lunar obliquity and inclination as new controlling variables to derive the cratering rate spatial variation as a function of longitude and latitude. With examining the influence of lunar obliquity and inclination on the asteroids population encountered by the Moon, we then have derived general formulas of the cratering rate spatial variation based on the crater scaling law. Our formulas with addition of lunar obliquity and inclination can reproduce the lunar cratering rate asymmetry at the current Earth-Moon distance and predict the apex/ant-apex ratio and the pole/equator ratio of this lunar cratering rate to be 1.36 and 0.87, respectively. The apex/ant-apex ratio is decreasing as the obliquity and inclination increasing. Combining with the evolution of lunar obliquity and inclination, our model shows that the apex/ant-apex ratio does not monotonically decrease with Earth-Moon distance and hence the influences of obliquity and inclination are not negligible on evolution of apex/ant-apex ratio. This model is generalizable to other planets and moons, especially for different spin-orbit resonances.

 How the Design of YouTube Influences User Sense of Agency	Kai Lukoff, Ulrik lyngs, Himanshu Zade, Vera Liao, James Choi, Kaiyue Fan, Sean Munson, Alexis Hiniker	kai1@uw.edu	None	In the attention economy, video apps employ design mechanisms like autoplay that exploit psychological vulnerabilities to maximize watch time. Consequently, many people feel a lack of agency over their app use, which is linked to negative life effects such as loss of sleep. Prior design research has innovated external mechanisms that police multiple apps, such as lockout timers. In this work, we shift the focus to how the internal mechanisms of an app can support user agency, taking the popular YouTube mobile app as a test case. From a survey of 120 U.S. users, we find that autoplay and recommendations primarily undermine sense of agency, while search and playlists support it. From 13 co-design sessions, we find that when users have a specific intention for how they want to use YouTube they prefer interfaces that support greater agency. We discuss implications for how designers can help users reclaim a sense of agency over their media use.	
 Generalizations of the Andrews-Yee identities associated with the mock theta functions ùúî‚Å¢(ùëû) and ùúà‚Å¢(ùëû)		berndt@illinois.edu	"Department of Mathematics, University of Illinois, 1409 West Green
Street, Urbana, IL 61801, USA"	George Andrews and Ae Ja Yee recently established beautiful results involving bivariate generalizations of the third order mock theta functions œâ ( q ) ùúî ùëû \omega(q) italic_œâ ( italic_q ) and ŒΩ ( q ) ùúà ùëû \nu(q) italic_ŒΩ ( italic_q ) , thereby extending their earlier results with the second author. Generalizing the Andrews-Yee identities for trivariate generalizations of these mock theta functions remained a mystery, as pointed out by Li and Yang in their recent work. We partially solve this problem and generalize these identities. Several new as well as well-known results are derived. For example, one of our two main theorems gives, as a corollary, a special case of Soon-Yi Kang‚Äôs three-variable reciprocity theorem. A relation between a new restricted overpartition function p * ( n ) superscript ùëù ùëõ p^{*}(n) italic_p start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_n ) and a weighted partition function p * ( n ) subscript ùëù ùëõ p_{*}(n) italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT * end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n ) is obtained from one of the special cases of our second theorem.	
 A characterization of constant ùëù-mean curvature surfaces in the Heisenberg group ùêª‚ÇÅ	HungLin Chiu and HsiaoFan Liu	hlchiu@math.nthu.edu.tw	Department of Mathematics, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300, R.O.C.	In Euclidean 3 3 3 3 -space, it is well known that the Sine-Gordon equation was considered in the nineteenth century in the course of investigations of surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature K = ‚àí 1 ùêæ 1 K=-1 italic_K = - 1 . Such a surface can be constructed from a solution to the Sine-Gordon equation, and vice versa. With this as motivation, employing the fundamental theorem of surfaces in the Heisenberg group H 1 subscript ùêª 1 H_{1} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , we show in this paper that the existence of a constant p ùëù p italic_p -mean curvature surface (without singular points) is equivalent to the existence of a solution to a nonlinear second-order ODE ( 1.2 ), which is a kind of Li√©nard equations . Therefore, we turn to investigate this equation. It is a surprise that we give a complete set of solutions to ( 1.2 ) (or ( 1.5 )), and hence use the types of the solution to divide constant p ùëù p italic_p -mean curvature surfaces into several classes. As a result, after a kind of normalization, we obtain a representation of constant p ùëù p italic_p -mean curvature surfaces and classify further all constant p ùëù p italic_p -mean curvature surfaces. In Section 9 , we provide an approach to construct p ùëù p italic_p -minimal surfaces. It turns out that, in some sense, generic p ùëù p italic_p -minimal surfaces can be constructed via this approach. Finally, as a derivation, we recover the Bernstein-type theorem which was first shown in [ 3 ] (or see [ 7 , 8 ] ).	
 Hamilton-Jacobi approach for linearly acceleration-dependent Lagrangians	Alejandro AguilarSalas, Efran Rojas	alejanaguilar@uv.mx	None	We develop a constructive procedure for arriving at the Hamilton-Jacobi framework for the so-called affine in acceleration theories by analysing the canonical constraint structure. We find two scenarios in dependence of the order of the emerging equations of motion. By properly defining generalized brackets, the non-involutive constraints that originally arose, in both scenarios, may be removed so that the resulting involutive Hamiltonian constraints ensure integrability of the theories and, at the same time, lead to the right dynamics in the reduced phase space. In particular, when we have second-order in derivatives equations of motion we are able to detect the gauge invariant sector of the theory by using a suitable approach based on the projection of the Hamiltonians onto the tangential and normal directions of the congruence of curves in the configuration space. Regarding this, we also explore the generators of canonical and gauge transformations of these theories. Further, we briefly outline how to determine the Hamilton principal function S ùëÜ S italic_S for some particular setups. We apply our findings to some representative theories: a Chern-Simons-like theory in ( 2 + 1 ) 2 1 (2+1) ( 2 + 1 ) -dim, an harmonic oscillator in 2 D 2 ùê∑ 2D 2 italic_D and, the geodetic brane cosmology emerging in the context of extra dimensions.	
 Object Detection Made Simpler by Eliminating Heuristic NMS	Qiang ZhoudaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Chaohui YudaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Chunhua ShendaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Zhibin WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hao ListartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTAlibaba GroupstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMonash University The University of Adelaide	None	None	We show a simple NMS-free, end-to-end object detection framework, of which the network is a minimal modification to a one-stage object detector such as the FCOS detection model [ 24 ] . We attain on par or even improved detection accuracy compared with the original one-stage detector. It performs detection at almost the same inference speed, while being even simpler in that now the post-processing NMS (non-maximum suppression) is eliminated during inference. If the network is capable of identifying only one positive sample for prediction for each ground-truth object instance in an image, then NMS would become unnecessary. This is made possible by attaching a compact PSS head for automatic selection of the single positive sample for each instance (see Fig. LABEL:fig:model ). As the learning objective involves both one-to-many and one-to-one label assignments, there is a conflict in the labels of some training examples, making the learning challenging. We show that by employing a stop-gradient operation, we can successfully tackle this issue and train the detector.	
 Random Graph Matching with Improved Noise Robustness			None	Graph matching, also known as network alignment, refers to finding a bijection between the vertex sets of two given graphs so as to maximally align their edges. This fundamental computational problem arises frequently in multiple fields such as computer vision and biology. Recently, there has been a plethora of work studying efficient algorithms for graph matching under probabilistic models. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for graph matching: Our algorithm associates each vertex with a signature vector using a multistage procedure and then matches a pair of vertices from the two graphs if their signature vectors are close to each other. We show that, for two Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graphs with edge correlation 1 ‚àí Œ± 1 ùõº 1-\alpha 1 - italic_Œ± , our algorithm recovers the underlying matching exactly with high probability when Œ± ‚â§ 1 / ( log ‚Å° log ‚Å° n ) C ùõº 1 superscript ùëõ ùê∂ \alpha\leq 1/(\log\log n)^{C} italic_Œ± ‚â§ 1 / ( roman_log roman_log italic_n ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_C end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , where n ùëõ n italic_n is the number of vertices in each graph and C ùê∂ C italic_C denotes a positive universal constant.

 Oceanic Superrotation on Tidally Locked Planets	Yaoxuan Zeng, Jun Yang	None	None	Is there oceanic superrotation on exoplanets? Atmospheric superrotation, characterized by west-to-east winds over the equator, is a common phenomenon in the atmospheres of Venus, Titan, Saturn, Jupiter, and tidally locked exoplanets. The stratospheric atmosphere of Earth is also superrotating during the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). However, whether the same phenomenon can occur in ocean is poorly known. Through numerical simulations, here we show that oceanic superrotation does occur on tidally locked terrestrial planets around low-mass stars. Its formation (spun-up from rest) is associated with surface winds, the equatorward momentum convergence by Rossby waves, and the eastward propagation of Kelvin waves in the ocean. Its maintenance is driven by equatorward momentum transports of coupled Rossby-Kelvin waves in the ocean excited from the uneven stellar radiation distribution. The width of the superrotation is mainly constrained by the Rossby deformation radius in the ocean, while its strength is more complex. Many factors can influence the strength, including planetary rotation rate, stellar flux, greenhouse gas concentration, seawater salinity, bottom drag, and a scaling theory is lack. This work confirms that superrotation can occur on tidally locked terrestrial planets with seawater oceans and suggests that it may also occur on tidally locked hot planets with magma oceans that will possibly be observed in the near future.	
 Annihilation and Control of Chiral Domain Walls with Magnetic Fields			None		
 1 Introduction			None	In this paper we develop an optimisation based approach to multivariate Chebyshev approximation on a finite grid. We consider two models: multivariate polynomial approximation and multivariate generalised rational approximation. In the second case the approximations are ratios of linear forms and the basis functions are not limited to monomials. It is already known that in the case of multivariate polynomial approximation on a finite grid the corresponding optimisation problems can be reduced to solving a linear programming problem, while the area of multivariate rational approximation is not so well understood. In this paper we demonstrate that in the case of multivariate generalised rational approximation the corresponding optimisation problems are quasiconvex. This statement remains true even when the basis functions are not limited to monomials. Then we apply a bisection method, which is a general method for quasiconvex optimisation. This method converges to an optimal solution with given precision. We demonstrate that the convex feasibility problems appearing in the bisection method can be solved using linear programming. Finally, we compare the deviation error and computational time for multivariate polynomial and generalised rational approximation with the same number of decision variables.	
 Joint Transmission Scheme and Coded Content Placement in Cluster-centric UAV-aided Cellular Networks	Zohreh HajiAkhondiMeybodi,, Arash Mohammadi,,Jamshid Abouei,, Ming Hou,, andKonstantinosNPlataniotis	None	None	Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on telecommunication for remote learning/working and telemedicine has significantly increased. In this context, preserving high Quality of Service (QoS) and maintaining low latency communication are of paramount importance. In cellular networks, incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can result in enhanced connectivity for outdoor users due to the high probability of establishing Line of Sight (LoS) links. The UAV‚Äôs limited battery life and its signal attenuation in indoor areas, however, make it inefficient to manage users‚Äô requests in indoor environments. Referred to as the Cluster-centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, the network‚Äôs coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments increases by considering a two-phase clustering framework for FAPs‚Äô formation and UAVs‚Äô deployment. Our first objective is to increase the content diversity. In this context, we propose a coded content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which is integrated with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) approach to mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents to be stored in each caching node to increase the cache-hit-ratio, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and decrease the users‚Äô access delay and cache redundancy for different content popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to assign the best caching node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their requests. In this regard, we define the movement speed of ground users as the decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor users‚Äô requests to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases the cache-hit-ratio, SINR, and cache diversity and decrease the users‚Äô access delay, cache redundancy and UAVs‚Äô energy consumption.	
 Spectral Functions from Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo without Analytic Continuation: The Extended Koopmans‚Äô Theorem Approach	Joonho Lee, Fionn Malone, Miguel Morales, David Reichman	jl5653@columbia.edu	None	We explore the extended Koopmans‚Äô theorem (EKT) within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. The EKT allows for the direct calculation of electron addition and removal spectral functions using reduced density matrices of the N ùëÅ N italic_N -particle system, and avoids the need for analytic continuation. The lowest level of EKT with AFQMC, called EKT1-AFQMC, is benchmarked using small molecules, 14-electron and 54-electron uniform electron gas supercells, and diamond at the Œì Œì \Gamma roman_Œì -point. Via comparison with numerically exact results (when possible) and coupled-cluster methods, we find that EKT1-AFQMC can reproduce the qualitative features of spectral functions for Koopmans-like charge excitations with errors in peak locations of less than 0.25 eV in a finite basis. We also note the numerical difficulties that arise in the EKT1-AFQMC eigenvalue problem, especially when back-propagated quantities are very noisy. We show how a systematic higher order EKT approach can correct errors in EKT1-based theories with respect to the satellite region of the spectral function. Our work will be of use for the study of low-energy charge excitations and spectral functions in correlated molecules and solids where AFQMC can be reliably performed.

However, these methods either need huge training and inference costs or bring little improvements. In this paper, we design a novel training method named APDI, which means augmenting proposals by the detector itself and can generate proposals with higher quality. Furthermore, APDI makes it possible to integrate IoU head into RoI box head. And it does not add any hyper-parameter, which is beneficial for future research and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset show that our method brings at least 2.7 AP improvements on Faster R-CNN with various backbones, and APDI can cooperate with advanced RPNs, such as GA-RPN and Cascade RPN, to obtain extra gains. Furthermore, it brings significant improvements on Cascade R-CNN. 1 1 1 All source codes will be released after publication.

 Testing hilltop supernatural inflation with gravitational waves	ChiaMin Lin	None	None	The scale of small-field inflation cannot be constrained via primordial gravitational waves through measurement of tensor-to-scalar ratio r ùëü r italic_r . In this study, I show that if cosmic strings are produced after symmetry breaking at the end of hilltop supernatural inflation, this small-field inflation model can be tested through the production of gravitational waves from cosmic strings. Future experiments of gravitational wave detectors will determine or further constrain the parameter space in the model.	
 Phase sensitive Landau-Zener-St√ºckelberg interference in superconducting quantum circuit	ZhiXuan Yang, YiMeng Zhang, YuXuan Zhou, LiBo Zhang, Fei Yan, Song Liu, Yuan Xu, Jian Li	None	None	Superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) architecture composed of superconducting qubit and resonator is a powerful platform for exploring quantum physics and quantum information processing. By employing techniques developed for superconducting quantum computing, we experimentally investigate phase-sensitive Landau-Zener-St√ºckelberg (LZS) interference phenomena in a circuit QED. Our experiments cover a large range of LZS transition parameters, and demonstrate the LZS induced Rabi-like oscillation as well as phase-dependent steady-state population.

 DOC2PPT: Automatic Presentation Slides Generation from Scientific Documents	TsuJui Fu, William Yang Wang, Daniel McDuff, Yale Song	None	None	Creating presentation materials requires complex multimodal reasoning skills to summarize key concepts and arrange them in a logical and visually pleasing manner. Can machines learn to emulate this laborious process? We present a novel task and approach for document-to-slide generation. Solving this involves document summarization, image and text retrieval, and slide structure to arrange key elements in a form suitable for presentation. We propose a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence approach to tackle our task in an end-to-end manner. Our approach exploits the inherent structures within documents and slides and incorporates paraphrasing and layout prediction modules to generate slides. To help accelerate research in this domain, we release a dataset of about 6K paired documents and slide decks used in our experiments. We show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and produces slides with rich content and aligned imagery. ‚Ä† ‚Ä† Project webpage: https://doc2ppt.github.io/

 Eccentric binary black hole surrogate models for the gravitational waveform and remnant properties: comparable mass, nonspinning case	Tousif Islam, Vijay Varma, Jackie Lodman, Scott Field, Gaurav Khanna, Mark Scheel, Harald Pfeiffer, Davide Gerosa, Lawrence Kidder	tislam@umassd.edu	None	We develop new strategies to build numerical relativity surrogate models for eccentric binary black hole systems, which are expected to play an increasingly important role in current and future gravitational-wave detectors. We introduce a new surrogate waveform model, NRSur2dq1Ecc , using 47 nonspinning, equal-mass waveforms with eccentricities up to 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 when measured at a reference time of 5500 M 5500 ùëÄ 5500M 5500 italic_M before merger. This is the first waveform model that is directly trained on eccentric numerical relativity simulations and does not require that the binary circularizes before merger. The model includes the ( 2 , 2 ) 2 2 (2,2) ( 2 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 2 ) 3 2 (3,2) ( 3 , 2 ) , and ( 4 , 4 ) 4 4 (4,4) ( 4 , 4 ) spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. We also build a final black hole model, NRSur2dq1EccRemnant , which models the mass, and spin of the remnant black hole. We show that our waveform model can accurately predict numerical relativity waveforms with mismatches ‚âà 10 ‚àí 3 absent superscript 10 3 \approx 10^{-3} ‚âà 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , while the remnant model can recover the final mass and dimensionless spin with absolute errors smaller than ‚âà 5 √ó 10 ‚àí 4 M absent 5 superscript 10 4 ùëÄ \approx 5\times 10^{-4}M ‚âà 5 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M and ‚âà 2 √ó 10 ‚àí 3 absent 2 superscript 10 3 \approx 2\times 10^{-3} ‚âà 2 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT respectively. We demonstrate that the waveform model can also recover subtle effects like mode-mixing in the ringdown signal without any special ad-hoc modeling steps. Finally, we show that despite being trained only on equal-mass binaries, NRSur2dq1Ecc can be reasonably extended up to mass ratio q ‚âà 3 ùëû 3 q\approx 3 italic_q ‚âà 3 with mismatches ‚âÉ 10 ‚àí 2 similar-to-or-equals absent superscript 10 2 \simeq 10^{-2} ‚âÉ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for eccentricities smaller than ‚àº 0.05 similar-to absent 0.05 \sim 0.05 ‚àº 0.05 as measured at a reference time of 2000 M 2000 ùëÄ 2000M 2000 italic_M before merger. The methods developed here should prove useful in the building of future eccentric surrogate models over larger regions of the parameter space.	
 Covert Model Poisoning Against Federated Learning: Algorithm Design and Optimization	KangWei,JunLi,MingDing,ChuanMa,YoSeb Jeon,andHVincentPoor	None	None	Federated learning (FL), as a type of distributed machine learning frameworks, is vulnerable to external attacks on FL models during parameters transmissions. An attacker in FL may control a number of participant clients, and purposely craft the uploaded model parameters to manipulate system outputs, namely, model poisoning (MP). In this paper, we aim to propose effective MP algorithms to combat state-of-the-art defensive aggregation mechanisms (e.g., Krum and Trimmed mean) implemented at the server without being noticed, i.e., covert MP (CMP). Specifically, we first formulate the MP as an optimization problem by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the manipulated model and designated one, constrained by a defensive aggregation rule. Then, we develop CMP algorithms against different defensive mechanisms based on the solutions of their corresponding optimization problems. Furthermore, to reduce the optimization complexity, we propose low complexity CMP algorithms with a slight performance degradation. In the case that the attacker does not know the defensive aggregation mechanism, we design a blind CMP algorithm, in which the manipulated model will be adjusted properly according to the aggregated model generated by the unknown defensive aggregation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMP algorithms are effective and substantially outperform existing attack mechanisms.	
 AdaSpring: Context-adaptive and Runtime-evolutionary Deep Model Compression for Mobile Applications	Sicong Liu, Bin Guo, Ke Ma, Zhiwen Yu, Junzhao Du	None	None	There are many deep learning ( e.g. DNN) powered mobile and wearable applications today continuously and unobtrusively sensing the ambient surroundings to enhance all aspects of human lives. To enable robust and private mobile sensing, DNN tends to be deployed locally on the resource-constrained mobile devices via model compression. The current practice either hand-crafted DNN compression techniques, i.e. , for optimizing DNN-relative performance ( e.g. parameter size), or on-demand DNN compression methods, i.e. , for optimizing hardware-dependent metrics ( e.g. latency), cannot be locally online because they require offline retraining to ensure accuracy. Also, none of them have correlated their efforts with runtime adaptive compression to consider the dynamic nature of deployment context of mobile applications. To address those challenges, we present AdaSpring, a context-adaptive and self-evolutionary DNN compression framework. It enables the runtime adaptive DNN compression locally online. Specifically, it presents the ensemble training of a retraining-free and self-evolutionary network to integrate multiple alternative DNN compression configurations ( i.e. , compressed architectures and weights). It then introduces the runtime search strategy to quickly search for the most suitable compression configurations and evolve the corresponding weights. With evaluation on five tasks across three platforms and a real-world case study, experiment outcomes show that AdaSpring obtains up to 3.1 √ó 3.1\times 3.1 √ó latency reduction, 4.2 √ó 4.2\times 4.2 √ó energy efficiency improvement in DNNs, compared to hand-crafted compression techniques, while only incurring ‚â§ 6.2 m s absent 6.2 ùëö ùë† \leq 6.2ms ‚â§ 6.2 italic_m italic_s runtime-evolution latency.	
 On explosive boiling of a multicomponent Leidenfrost drop	Sijia Lyu, Huanshu Tan, Yuki Wakata, Xianjun Yang, Chung Law, Detlef Lohse, Chao Sun	None	None	The gasification of multicomponent fuel drops is relevant in various energy-related technologies. An interesting phenomenon associated with this process is the self-induced explosion of the drop, producing a multitude of smaller secondary droplets, which promotes overall fuel atomization and, consequently, improves the combustion efficiency and reduces emissions of liquid-fueled engines. Here, we study a unique explosive gasification process of a tri-component droplet consisting of water, ethanol, and oil (‚Äúouzo‚Äù), by high-speed monitoring of the entire gasification event taking place in the well-controlled, levitated Leidenfrost state over a superheated plate. It is observed that the preferential evaporation of the most volatile component, ethanol, triggers nucleation of the oil microdroplets/nanodroplets in the remaining drop, which, consequently, becomes an opaque oil-in-water microemulsion. The tiny oil droplets subsequently coalesce into a large one, which, in turn, wraps around the remnant water. Because of the encapsulating oil layer, the droplet can no longer produce enough vapor for its levitation, and, thus, falls and contacts the superheated surface. The direct thermal contact leads to vapor bubble formation inside the drop and consequently drop explosion in the final stage.	
 Weakly Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Module Networks for Numerical Reasoning	Amrita Saha, Shafiq Joty, Steven CH Hoi	None	None	Neural Module Networks (NMNs) have been quite successful in incorporating explicit reasoning as learnable modules in various question answering tasks, including the most generic form of numerical reasoning over text in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need strong supervision in executing the query as a specialized program over reasoning modules and fail to generalize to more open-ended settings without such supervision. Hence we propose W eakly-Supervised N euro- S ymbolic M odule N etwork (WNSMN) trained with answers as the sole supervision for numerical reasoning based MRC. It learns to execute a noisy heuristic program obtained from the dependency parsing of the query, as discrete actions over both neural and symbolic reasoning modules and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement learning framework with discrete reward from answer matching. On the numerical-answer subset of DROP, WNSMN outperforms NMN by 32% and the reasoning-free language model GenBERT by 8% in exact match accuracy when trained under comparable weak supervised settings. This showcases the effectiveness and generalizability of modular networks that can handle explicit discrete reasoning over noisy programs in an end-to-end manner.

 Effect of the sample work function on alkali metal dosing induced electronic structure change	Saegyeol Jung, Yukiaki Ishida, Minsoo Kim, Masamichi Nakajima, Shigeyuki Ishida, Hiroshi Eisaki, Woojae Choi, Yong Seung Kwon, Jonathan Denlinger, Toshio Otsu, Yohei Kobayashi, Soonsang Huh, Changyoung Kim	None	None	Alkali metal dosing (AMD) has been widely used as a way to control doping without chemical substitution. This technique, in combination with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), often provides an opportunity to observe unexpected phenomena. However, the amount of transferred charge and the corresponding change in the electronic structure vary significantly depending on the material. Here, we report study on the correlation between the sample work function and alkali metal induced electronic structure change for three iron-based superconductors: FeSe, Ba(Fe 0.94 0.94 {}_{0.94} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 0.94 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Co 0.06 0.06 {}_{0.06} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 0.06 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT As 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and NaFeAs which share a similar Fermi surface topology. Electronic structure change upon monolayer of alkali metal dosing and the sample work function were measured by ARPES. Our results show that the degree of electronic structure change is proportional to the difference between the work function of the sample and Mulliken‚Äôs absolute electronegativity of the dosed alkali metal. This finding provides a possible way to estimate the AMD induced electronic structure change.	
 Chronological Age Estimation of Lateral Cephalometric Radiographs with Deep Learning	Zhiyong Zhang, Ningtao Liu, Shuiping Gou, Chunxia Yan, Wenfan Jing	None	None	Traditional manual age estimation method is crucial labour based on many kinds of X-Ray image. Some current studies have shown that lateral cephalometric(LC) images can be used to estimate age. However, these methods are based on manually measuring some image features and making age estimates based on experience or scoring. Therefore, these methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the effect will be affected by subjective opinions. In this work, we propose a saliency map-enhanced age estimation method, which can automatically perform age estimation based on LC images. Meanwhile it can also show the importance of each region in the image for age estimation, which undoubtedly increases the method‚Äôs Interpretability. Our method was tested on 3014 LC images from 4 to 40 years old. The MEA of the experimental result is 1.250, which is less than the result of the state-of-the-art benchmark, because it performs significantly better in the age group with less data. In addition, our model is trained in each area with high contribution to age estimation in LC images, so the effect of these different areas on the age estimation task were verified. Consequently, we conclude that the proposed saliency map enhancemented chronological age estimation method of lateral cephalometric radiographs can work well in chronological age estimation task, especially when the amount of data is small. In addition, compared with traditional deep learning, our method is also interpretable.	
 Unique equilibrium states for geodesic flows on flat surfaces with singularities	Benjamin Call, David Constantine, Alena Erchenko,Noelle Sawyer, Grace Work	None	None	Consider a compact surface of genus ‚â• 2 absent 2 \geq 2 ‚â• 2 equipped with a metric that is flat everywhere except at finitely many cone points with angles greater than 2 œÄ 2 ùúã 2\pi 2 italic_œÄ . Following the technique in the work of Burns, Climenhaga, Fisher, and Thompson, we prove that sufficiently regular potential functions have unique equilibrium states if the singular set does not support the full pressure. Moreover, we show that the pressure gap holds for any potential which is locally constant on a neighborhood of the singular set. Finally, we establish that the corresponding equilibrium states have the K ùêæ K italic_K -property, and closed regular geodesics equidistribute.	
 A Kernel-Based Neural Network for High-dimensional Genetic Risk Prediction Analysis	Xiaoxi Shen, Xiaoran TongandQing Lu	None	None	Risk prediction capitalizing on emerging human genome findings holds great promise for new prediction and prevention strategies. While the large amounts of genetic data generated from high-throughput technologies offer us a unique opportunity to study a deep catalog of genetic variants for risk prediction, the high-dimensionality of genetic data and complex relationships between genetic variants and disease outcomes bring tremendous challenges to risk prediction analysis. To address these rising challenges, we propose a kernel-based neural network (KNN) method. KNN inherits features from both linear mixed models (LMM) and classical neural networks and is designed for high-dimensional risk prediction analysis. To deal with datasets with millions of variants, KNN summarizes genetic data into kernel matrices and use the kernel matrices as inputs. Based on the kernel matrices, KNN builds a single-layer feedforward neural network, which makes it feasible to consider complex relationships between genetic variants and disease outcomes. The parameter estimation in KNN is based on MINQUE and we show, that under certain conditions, the average prediction error of KNN can be smaller than that of LMM. Simulation studies also confirm the results.	
 Top-quark pair production in association with a ùëä^¬± gauge boson in the POWHEG-BOX	FFebres Cordero, MKraus, LReina	ffebres@hep.fsu.edu	None	We present a new Monte Carlo event generator for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a W ¬± superscript ùëä plus-or-minus W^{\pm} italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ¬± end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT boson at hadron colliders in the POWHEG-BOX framework.

The fixed-order QCD calculation is further interfaced with the PYTHIA8 parton-shower event generator via the POWHEG method as implemented in the POWHEG-BOX . The corresponding code is now part of the public repository of the POWHEG-BOX . We perform a comparison of different event generators for both the case of inclusive production and the case of the two same-sign leptons signature at the Large Hadron Collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV 13 TeV 13~{}\mathrm{TeV} 13 roman_TeV . We investigate theoretical uncertainties in the modelling of the fiducial volume stemming from missing higher-order corrections, the different parton shower matching schemes, and the modelling of decays. We find that the subleading contribution at ùí™ ( Œ± s Œ± 3 ) ùí™ subscript ùõº ùë† superscript ùõº 3 \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}\alpha^{3}) caligraphic_O ( italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œ± start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) is particularly sensitive to differences in the matching scheme and higher-order parton shower effects. We observe that in particular jet observables can differ quite visibly although these differences play only a subordinate role in the description of physical observables once all contributions are combined.	
 Integral Representations of Ultraspherical Polynomials II	Bingham and Tasmin Symons	n.bingham@imperial.ac.uk	None	In the first part, by the first author‚Äôs work of 1972, an integral representation for an ultraspherical polynomial of higher index in terms of one of lower index and an infinite series was obtained. While this representation works well from a theoretical point of view, it is not numerically satisfactory as it involves polynomials of high degree, which are numerically unstable. Here we sum this series to obtain an integral, which is numerically tractable.	
 Non-intrusive reduced order modeling of poroelasticity of heterogeneous media based on a discontinuous Galerkin approximation	Teeratorn KadeethumSibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringCornell University, New York, USAIthaca, New York, USAFrancesco BallarinmathLab, Mathematics AreaSISSA, ItalyNikolaos BouklasSibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringCornell University, New York, USAIthaca, New York, USA	None	None	A simulation tool capable of speeding up the calculation for linear poroelasticity problems in heterogeneous porous media is of large practical interest for engineers, in particular, to effectively perform sensitivity analyses, uncertainty quantification, optimization, or control operations on the fluid pressure and bulk deformation fields. Towards this goal, we present here a non-intrusive model reduction framework using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and neural networks, based on the usual offline-online paradigm. As the conductivity of porous media can be highly heterogeneous and span several orders of magnitude, we utilize the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as a full order solver to handle discontinuity and ensure local mass conservation during the offline stage. We then use POD as a data compression tool and compare the nested POD technique, in which time and uncertain parameter domains are compressed consecutively, to the classical POD method in which all domains are compressed simultaneously. The neural networks are finally trained to map the set of uncertain parameters, which could correspond to material properties, boundary conditions, or geometric characteristics, to the collection of coefficients calculated from an L 2 superscript ùêø 2 L^{2} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT projection over the reduced basis. We then perform a non-intrusive evaluation of the neural networks to obtain coefficients corresponding to new values of the uncertain parameters during the online stage. We show that our framework provides reasonable approximations of the DG solution, but it is significantly faster. Moreover, the reduced order framework can capture sharp discontinuities of both displacement and pressure fields resulting from the heterogeneity in the media conductivity, which is generally challenging for intrusive reduced order methods. The sources of error are presented, showing that the nested POD technique is computationally advantageous and still provides comparable accuracy to the classical POD method. We also explore the effect of different choices of the hyperparameters of the neural network on the framework performance.	
 Effect of rate of change of parameter on early warning signals for critical transitions	Induja Pavithran, Sujith	None	None	Many dynamical systems exhibit abrupt transitions or tipping as the control parameter is varied. In scenarios where the parameter is varied continuously, the rate of change of control parameter greatly affects the performance of early warning signals (EWS) for such critical transitions. We study the impact of variation of the control parameter with a finite rate on the performance of EWS for critical transitions in a thermoacoustic system (a horizontal Rijke tube) exhibiting subcritical Hopf bifurcation. There is a growing interest in developing early warning signals for tipping in real systems. Firstly, we explore the efficacy of early warning signals based on critical slowing down and fractal characteristics . From this study, lag-1 autocorrelation (AC) and Hurst exponent ( H ùêª H italic_H ) are found to be good measures to predict the transition well-before the tipping point. The warning time, obtained using AC and H ùêª H italic_H , reduces with an increase in the rate of change of the control parameter following an inverse power law relation. Hence, for very fast rates, the warning time may be too short to perform any control action. Furthermore, we report the observation of a hyperexponential scaling relation between the AC and the variance of fluctuations during such dynamic Hopf bifurcation. We construct a theoretical model for noisy Hopf bifurcation wherein the control parameter is continuously varied at different rates to study the effect of rate of change of parameter on EWS . Similar results, including the hyperexponential scaling, are observed in the model as well.	
 SwingBot: Learning Physical Features from In-hand Tactile Exploration for Dynamic Swing-up Manipulation	Chen Wang,absent,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Shaoxiong WangabsentstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Branden RomerostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Filipe VeigastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Edward AdelsonstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPThttpgelsightcsailmiteduswingbot	None	None	Several robot manipulation tasks are extremely sensitive to variations of the physical properties of the manipulated objects. One such task is manipulating objects by using gravity or arm accelerations, increasing the importance of mass, center of mass, and friction information. We present SwingBot, a robot that is able to learn the physical features of a held object through tactile exploration. Two exploration actions (tilting and shaking) provide the tactile information used to create a physical feature embedding space. With this embedding, SwingBot is able to predict the swing angle achieved by a robot performing dynamic swing-up manipulations on a previously unseen object. Using these predictions, it is able to search for the optimal control parameters for a desired swing-up angle. We show that with the learned physical features our end-to-end self-supervised learning pipeline is able to substantially improve the accuracy of swinging up unseen objects. We also show that objects with similar dynamics are closer to each other on the embedding space and that the embedding can be disentangled into values of specific physical properties.

 Interpolating Classifiers Make Few Mistakes	Tengyuan Liang, Benjamin Recht	None	None	This paper provides elementary analyses of the regret and generalization of minimum-norm interpolating classifiers (MNIC). The MNIC is the function of smallest Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space norm that perfectly interpolates a label pattern on a finite data set. We derive a mistake bound for MNIC and a regularized variant that holds for all data sets. This bound follows from elementary properties of matrix inverses. Under the assumption that the data is independently and identically distributed, the mistake bound implies that MNIC generalizes at a rate proportional to the norm of the interpolating solution and inversely proportional to the number of data points. This rate matches similar rates derived for margin classifiers and perceptrons. We derive several plausible generative models where the norm of the interpolating classifier is bounded or grows at a rate sublinear in n ùëõ n italic_n . We also show that as long as the population class conditional distributions are sufficiently separable in total variation, then MNIC generalizes with a fast rate.	
 Inference of stochastic time series with missing data	Sangwon Lee, Vipul Periwal, Junghyo Jo	None	None	Inferring dynamics from time series is an important objective in data analysis. In particular, it is challenging to infer stochastic dynamics given incomplete data. We propose an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that iterates between alternating two steps: E-step restores missing data points, while M-step infers an underlying network model from the restored data. Using synthetic data of a kinetic Ising model, we confirm that the algorithm works for restoring missing data points as well as inferring the underlying model. At the initial iteration of the EM algorithm, the model inference shows better model-data consistency with observed data points than with missing data points. As we keep iterating, however, missing data points show better model-data consistency. We find that demanding equal consistency of observed and missing data points provides an effective stopping criterion for the iteration to prevent going beyond the most accurate model inference. Using the EM algorithm and the stopping criterion together , we infer missing data points from a time-series data of real neuronal activities. Our method reproduces collective properties of neuronal activities such as correlations and firing statistics even when 70% of data points are masked as missing points .	
 Acoustic Communication and Sensing for Inflatable Modular Soft Robots	Daniel DrewstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Matthew DevlinstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Elliot HawkesstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Sean FollmerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Modular soft robots combine the strengths of two traditionally separate areas of robotics. As modular robots, they can show robustness to individual failure and reconfigurability; as soft robots, they can deform and undergo large shape changes in order to adapt to their environment, and have inherent human safety. However, for sensing and communication these robots also combine the challenges of both: they require solutions that are scalable (low cost and complexity) and efficient (low power) to enable collectives of large numbers of robots, and these solutions must also be able to interface with the high extension ratio elastic bodies of soft robots. In this work, we seek to address these challenges using acoustic signals produced by piezoelectric surface transducers that are cheap, simple, and low power, and that not only integrate with but also leverage the elastic robot skins for signal transmission. Importantly, to further increase scalability, the transducers exhibit multi-functionality made possible by a relatively flat frequency response across the audible and ultrasonic ranges. With minimal hardware, they enable directional contact-based communication, audible-range communication at a distance, and exteroceptive sensing. We demonstrate a subset of the decentralized collective behaviors these functions make possible with multi-robot hardware implementations. The use of acoustic waves in this domain is shown to provide distinct advantages over existing solutions.	
 Contagion-Preserving Network Sparsifiers: Exploring Epidemic Edge Importance Utilizing Effective Resistance	Alexander Mercier,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Network epidemiology has become a vital tool in understanding the effects of high-degree vertices, geographic and demographic communities, and other inhomogeneities in social structure on the spread of disease. However, many networks derived from modern datasets are quite dense, such as mobility networks where each location has links to a large number of potential destinations. One way to reduce the computational effort of simulating epidemics on these networks is sparsification, where we select a representative subset of edges based on some measure of their importance. Recently an approach was proposed using an algorithm based on the effective resistance of the edges. We explore how effective resistance is correlated with the probability that an edge transmits disease in the SI model. We find that in some cases these two notions of edge importance are well correlated, making effective resistance a computationally efficient proxy for the importance of an edge to epidemic spread. In other cases, the correlation is weaker, and we discuss situations in which effective resistance is not a good proxy for epidemic importance.

In this work, we present the first ever detailed abundance analysis of carbon star LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 and a detailed abundance analysis of neutron-capture elements for the object LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3. Updates on the abundances of elements C, O, Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn and Ni for LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 are also presented. Our analysis is based on high resolution spectra obtained using Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) attached to the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), IAO, Hanle.

We have examined if the i-process model yields ([X/Fe]) of heavy elements could explain the observed abundances of the CEMP-r/s star based on a parametric model based analysis. The negative values obtained for the neutron density dependent [Rb/Zr] ratio confirm former low-mass AGB companions for both the stars. Kinematic analysis shows that LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 belongs to the Galactic halo population and LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 to the disc population.	
 Abundances of neutron-capture elements in CH and Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars	Meenakshi Purandardasand Aruna Goswami	None	None	All the elements heavier than Fe are produced either by slow (-s) or rapid (-r) neutron-capture process. Neutron density prevailing in the stellar sites is one of the major factors that determines the type of neutron-capture processes. We present the results based on the estimates of corrected value of absolute carbon abundance, [C/N] ratio, carbon isotopic ratio and [hs/ls] ratio obtained from the high resolution spectral analysis of six stars that include both CH stars and CEMP stars. All the stars show enhancement of neutron-capture elements. Location of these objects in the A(C) vs. [Fe/H] diagram shows that they are Group I objects, with external origin of carbon and neutron-capture elements. Low values of carbon isotopic ratios estimated for these objects may also be attributed to some external sources. As the carbon isotopic ratio is a good indicator of mixing, we have used the estimates of 12 12 {}^{12} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C/ 13 13 {}^{13} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C ratios to examine the occurance of mixing in the stars. While the object HD 30443 might have experienced an extra mixing process that usually occurs after red giant branch (RGB) bump for stars with log(L/L ‚äô direct-product {}_{\odot} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ) > > > 2.0, the remaining objects do not show any evidence of having undergone any such mixing process. The higher values of [C/N] ratios obtained for these objects also indicate that none of these objects have experienced any strong internal mixing processes. Based on the estimated abundances of carbon and the neutron-capture elements, and the abundance ratios, we have classified the objects into different groups. While the objects HE 0110 ‚àí - - 0406, HD 30443 and CD ‚àí - - 38 2151 are found to be CEMP-s stars, HE 0308 ‚àí - - 1612 and HD 176021 show characteristic properties of CH stars with moderate enhancement of carbon. The object CD ‚àí - - 28 1082 with enhancement of both r- and s-process elements is found to belong to the CEMP-r/s group.	
 Exploring Lightweight Interventions at Posting Time to Reduce the Sharing of Misinformation on Social Media	Farnaz Jahanbakhsh, Amy Zhang, Adam Berinsky, Gordon Pennycook, David Rand, David Karger	None	None	When users on social media share content without considering its veracity, they may unwittingly be spreading misinformation. In this work, we investigate the design of lightweight interventions that nudge users to assess the accuracy of information as they share it. Such assessment may deter users from posting misinformation in the first place, and their assessments may also provide useful guidance to friends aiming to assess those posts themselves.	
 Numerical and approximate solutions for two-dimensional hyperbolic telegraph equation via wavelet matrices	Vijay Kumar Patel, Dhirendra Bahuguna	vijaybhuiit@gmail.com	Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Indian Institute of Technology kanpur, India	The present article is devoted to developing the Legendre wavelet operational matrix method (LWOMM) to find the numerical solution of two-dimensional hyperbolic telegraph equations (HTE) with appropriate initial time boundary space conditions. The Legendre wavelets series with unknown coefficients have been used for approximating the solution in both of the spatial and temporal variables. The basic idea for discretizing two-dimensional HTE is based on differentiation and integration of operational matrices. By implementing LWOMM on HTE, HTE is transformed into algebraic generalized Sylvester equation. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented numerical scheme. Comparisons of numerical results associated with the proposed method with some of the existing numerical methods confirm that the method is easy, accurate and fast experimentally. Moreover, we have investigated the convergence analysis of multidimensional Legendre wavelet approximation. Finally we have compared our result with research article of Mittal and Bhatia (see mittal_2014 ).	
 Testing isospin symmetry breaking in ab initio nuclear theory	MSMartin, SRStroberg, JDHolt, KGLeach	matthew_martin_3@sfu.ca	None	In this work we present the first steps towards benchmarking isospin symmetry breaking in ab initio nuclear theory for calculations of superallowed Fermi Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ -decay. Using the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, we calculate b ùëè b italic_b and c ùëê c italic_c coefficients of the isobaric multiplet mass equation, starting from two different Hamiltonians constructed from chiral effective field theory. We compare results to experimental measurements for all T = 1 ùëá 1 T=1 italic_T = 1 isobaric analogue triplets of relevance to superallowed Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ -decay for masses A = 10 ùê¥ 10 A=10 italic_A = 10 to A = 74 ùê¥ 74 A=74 italic_A = 74 and find an overall agreement within approximately 250 keV of experimental data for both b ùëè b italic_b and c ùëê c italic_c coefficients. A greater level of accuracy, however, is obtained by a phenomenological Skyrme interaction or a classical charged-sphere estimate. Finally, we show that evolution of the valence-space operator does not meaningfully improve the quality of the coefficients with respect to experimental data, which indicates that higher-order many-body effects are likely not responsible for the observed discrepancies.	
 Quantum Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem Far From Equilibrium	Zhedong Zhang, Xuanhua Wang, Jin Wang	zzhan26@cityu.edu.hk	None	Fluctuations associated with relaxations in far-from-equilibrium regime is of fundamental interest for a large variety of systems within broad scales. Recent advances in techniques such as spectroscopy have generated the possibility for measuring the fluctuations of the mesoscopic systems in connection to the relaxation processes when driving the underlying quantum systems far from equilibrium. We present a general nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) for quantum Markovian processes where the detailed-balance condition is violated. Apart from the fluctuations, the relaxation involves extra correlation that is governed by the quantum curl flux emerged in the far-from-equilibrium regime. Such a contribution vanishes for the thermal equilibrium, so that the conventional FDT is recovered. We finally apply the nonequilibrium FDT to the molecular junctions, elaborating the detailed-balance-breaking effects on the optical transmission spectrum. Our results have the advantage of and exceed the scope of the fluctuation-dissipation relation in the perturbative and near equilibrium regimes, and is of broad interest for the study of quantum thermodynamics.	
 Adaptive Decision Forest: An Incremental Machine Learning Framework	Md Geaur Rahman, Md Zahidul Islam	grahman@csu.edu.au	School of Computing and Mathematics, Charles Sturt University, Australia	In this study, we present an incremental machine learning framework called Adaptive Decision Forest (ADF), which produces a decision forest to classify new records. Based on our two novel theorems, we introduce a new splitting strategy called iSAT, which allows ADF to classify new records even if they are associated with previously unseen classes. ADF is capable of identifying and handling concept drift; it, however, does not forget previously gained knowledge. Moreover, ADF is capable of handling big data if the data can be divided into batches. We evaluate ADF on five publicly available natural data sets and one synthetic data set, and compare the performance of ADF against the performance of eight state-of-the-art techniques. Our experimental results, including statistical sign test and Nemenyi test analyses, indicate a clear superiority of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art techniques.	
 Importance of the heavy-quarks longitudinal structure function measurements at future circular collider energies	GRBoroun	grboroun@gmail.com; boroun@razi.ac.ir	None	In this article, we consider the ratio of structure functions for heavy quark pair production at low values of x ùë• x italic_x . The importance of this ratio for charm and beauty pair production is examined according to the Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) data. The behavior of these ratios considers due to the hard-pomeron behavior of the gluon distribution function. The results are in good agreement with respect to the HERA data. Expanding this data to the range of new energies underscore the importance of these measurements for heavy quarks. The ratio of charm and beauty structure functions at the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) is considered as a function of invariant center-of-mass energy. For top pair production this ratio is extracted with known kinematics of the LHeC and Future Circular Collider electron-hadron (FCC-eh) colliders. Comparison of the results obtained for the ratio of top structure functions in LHeC and FCC-eh are proportional to the specified inelasticity y ùë¶ y italic_y range.

The charm and beauty structure functions are determined and compared with the HERA combined data. The results are in good agreement with respect to the experimental data. We also compare the obtained charm and bottom structure functions with the results from CTEQ6.6 [Phys.Rev.D 78 , 013004(2008)] and NNPDF3.1[Eur.Phys.J.C 77 , 663(2017)] parameterization models.

Because interstellar minor bodies are moving much faster, they hit planets harder and more often than in the local Galaxy. I estimate the rates for Chicxulub-scale impacts on an Earth-size planet in elliptical galaxies as a potential habitability constraint on intelligent life. Around most stars in a normal elliptical galaxy, these planets receive only ‚àº 0.01 ‚Äì 0.1 Gyr ‚àí 1 similar-to absent 0.01 ‚Äì 0.1 superscript Gyr 1 \sim 0.01\text{--}0.1\ \textrm{Gyr}^{-1} ‚àº 0.01 ‚Äì 0.1 Gyr start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , although hazardous rates may be common in certain compact early-type galaxies and red nuggets.

 Neural Architecture Search with Random Labels	Xuanyang Zhang Pengfei Hou Xiangyu ZhangJian SunMEGVII Technology	None	None	In this paper, we investigate a new variant of neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm ‚Äì searching with random labels (RLNAS). The task sounds counter-intuitive for most existing NAS algorithms since random label provides few information on the performance of each candidate architecture. Instead, we propose a novel NAS framework based on ease-of-convergence hypothesis, which requires only random labels during searching. The algorithm involves two steps: first, we train a SuperNet using random labels; second, from the SuperNet we extract the sub-network whose weights change most significantly during the training. Extensive experiments are evaluated on multiple datasets (e.g. NAS-Bench-201 and ImageNet) and multiple search spaces (e.g. DARTS-like and MobileNet-like). Very surprisingly, RLNAS achieves comparable or even better results compared with state-of-the-art NAS methods such as PC-DARTS, Single Path One-Shot, even though the counterparts utilize full ground truth labels for searching. We hope our finding could inspire new understandings on the essential of NAS. Code is available at https://github.com/megvii-model/RLNAS .	
 Reducing ReLU Count for Privacy-Preserving CNN Speedup	Inbar Helbitz,Shai Avidan	None	None	Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning algorithms must balance classification accuracy with data privacy. This can be done using a combination of cryptographic and machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs typically consist of two types of operations: a convolutional or linear layer, followed by a non-linear function such as ReLU. Each of these types can be implemented efficiently using a different cryptographic tool. But these tools require different representations and switching between them is time-consuming and expensive. Recent research suggests that ReLU is responsible for most of the communication bandwidth.	
 DRAG: Director-Generator Language Modelling Framework for Non-Parallel Author Stylized Rewriting	Hrituraj SinghAdobe ResearchGaurav VermaGeorgia TechAparna GarimellaAdobe ResearchBalaji Vasan SrinivasanAdobe Research	None	None	Author stylized rewriting is the task of rewriting an input text in a particular author‚Äôs style. Recent works in this area have leveraged Transformer-based language models in a denoising autoencoder setup to generate author stylized text without relying on a parallel corpus of data. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of explicit control of target attributes and being entirely data-driven. In this paper, we propose a Director-Generator framework to rewrite content in the target author‚Äôs style, specifically focusing on certain target attributes. We show that our proposed framework works well even with a limited-sized target author corpus. Our experiments on corpora consisting of relatively small-sized text authored by three distinct authors show significant improvements upon existing works to rewrite input texts in target author‚Äôs style. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses further show that our model has better meaning retention and results in more fluent generations.

National Astronomical Observatory,
Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan"	The balanced homodyne detection as a readout scheme of gravitational-wave detectors is carefully examined, which specifies the directly measured quantum operator in the detection. This specification is necessary to apply the quantum measurement theory to gravitational-wave detections. We clarify the contribution of vacuum fluctuations to the noise spectral density without using the two-photon formulation. We found that the noise spectral density in the two-photon formulation includes vacuum fluctuations from the main interferometer but does not includes those from the local oscillator which depends on the directly measured operators.

 A holistic approach to computing first-arrival traveltimes using neural networks	Umair bin Waheed, Tariq Alkhalifah, Ehsan Haghighat, Chao Song	umair.waheed@kfupm.edu.sa	Department of Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.	Since the original algorithm by John Vidale in 1988 to numerically solve the isotropic eikonal equation, there has been tremendous progress on the topic addressing an array of challenges, including improvement of the solution accuracy, incorporation of surface topography, adding more accurate physics by accounting for anisotropy/attenuation in the medium, and speeding up computations using multiple CPUs and GPUs. Despite these advances, there is no mechanism in these algorithms to carry information gained by solving one problem to the next. Moreover, these approaches may breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring simplification of the equations to estimate approximate solutions . Therefore, we seek an alternate approach to address the challenge in a holistic manner, i.e., a method that not only makes it simpler to incorporate topography, allows accounting for any level of complexity in physics, benefiting from computational speedup due to the availability of multiple CPUs or GPUs, but also able to transfer knowledge gained from solving one problem to the next. We develop an algorithm based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural network to solve various forms of the eikonal equation. We show how transfer learning and surrogate modeling can be used to speed up computations by utilizing information gained from prior solutions. We also propose a two-stage optimization scheme to expedite the training process in the presence of sharper heterogeneity in the velocity model and recommend using a locally adaptive activation function for faster convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach makes it simpler to incorporate additional physics and other features in contrast to conventional methods that took years and often decades to make these advances. Such an approach not only makes the implementation of eikonal solvers much simpler but also puts us on a much faster path to progress. The method paves the pathway to solving complex forms of the eikonal equation that have remained unsolved using conventional algorithms or solved using some approximation techniques at best; thereby, creating new possibilities for advancement in the field of numerical eikonal solvers.

 A Taxonomy of Explainable Bayesian Networks	Iena Petronella Derks, Alta de Waal	None	None	Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular, the explainability thereof, has gained phenomenal attention over the last few years. Whilst we usually do not question the decision-making process of these systems in situations where only the outcome is of interest, we do however pay close attention when these systems are applied in areas where the decisions directly influence the lives of humans. It is especially noisy and uncertain observations close to the decision boundary which results in predictions which cannot necessarily be explained that may foster mistrust among end-users. This drew attention to AI methods for which the outcomes can be explained. Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models that can be used as a tool to manage uncertainty. The probabilistic framework of a Bayesian network allows for explainability in the model, reasoning and evidence. The use of these methods is mostly ad hoc and not as well organised as explainability methods in the wider AI research field. As such, we introduce a taxonomy of explainability in Bayesian networks. We extend the existing categorisation of explainability in the model, reasoning or evidence to include explanation of decisions. The explanations obtained from the explainability methods are illustrated by means of a simple medical diagnostic scenario. The taxonomy introduced in this paper has the potential not only to encourage end-users to efficiently communicate outcomes obtained, but also support their understanding of how and, more importantly, why certain predictions were made.	
 POD-DL-ROM: enhancing deep learning-based reduced order models for nonlinear parametrized PDEs by proper orthogonal decomposition	Stefania Fresca, Andrea Manzoni	stefania.fresca@polimi.com	MOX - Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Milano, P.zza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milano, Italy	Deep learning-based reduced order models (DL-ROMs) have been recently proposed to overcome common limitations shared by conventional reduced order models (ROMs) ‚Äì built, e.g., through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) ‚Äì when applied to nonlinear time-dependent parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs). These might be related to (i) the need to deal with projections onto high dimensional linear approximating trial manifolds, (ii) expensive hyper-reduction strategies, or (iii) the intrinsic difficulty to handle physical complexity with a linear superimposition of modes. All these aspects are avoided when employing DL-ROMs, which learn in a non-intrusive way both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics, by relying on deep (e.g., feedforward, convolutional, autoencoder) neural networks. Although extremely efficient at testing time, when evaluating the PDE solution for any new testing-parameter instance, DL-ROMs require an expensive training stage, because of the extremely large number of network parameters to be estimated. In this paper we propose a possible way to avoid an expensive training stage of DL-ROMs, by (i) performing a prior dimensionality reduction through POD, and (ii) relying on a multi-fidelity pretraining stage, where different physical models can be efficiently combined. The proposed POD-DL-ROM is tested on several (both scalar and vector, linear and nonlinear) time-dependent parametrized PDEs (such as, e.g., linear advection-diffusion-reaction, nonlinear diffusion-reaction, nonlinear elastodynamics, and Navier-Stokes equations) to show the generality of this approach and its remarkable computational savings.	
 A Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network Framework for Automated Software Bug Triaging	HongrunWu,YutaoMa,ZhenglongXiang,ChenYang,andKeqingHe	None	None	The bug triaging process, an essential process of assigning bug reports to the most appropriate developers, is related closely to the quality and costs of software development. As manual bug assignment is a labor-intensive task, especially for large-scale software projects, many machine-learning-based approaches have been proposed to automatically triage bug reports. Although developer collaboration networks (DCNs) are dynamic and evolving in the real-world, most automated bug triaging approaches focus on static tossing graphs at a single time slice. Also, none of the previous studies consider periodic interactions among developers. To address the problems mentioned above, in this article, we propose a novel spatial-temporal dynamic graph neural network (ST-DGNN) framework, including a joint random walk (JRWalk) mechanism and a graph recurrent convolutional neural network (GRCNN) model. In particular, JRWalk aims to sample local topological structures in a graph with two sampling strategies by considering both node importance and edge importance. GRCNN has three components with the same structure, i.e., hourly-periodic, daily-periodic, and weekly-periodic components, to learn the spatial-temporal features of dynamic DCNs. We evaluated our approach‚Äôs effectiveness by comparing it with several state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods in two domain-specific tasks that belong to node classification. In the two tasks, experiments on two real-world, large-scale developer collaboration networks collected from the Eclipse and Mozilla projects indicate that the proposed approach outperforms all the baseline methods.	
 High bandwidth laser-frequency-locking for wideband noise suppression	Mingyong Jing, ,, Peng Zhang, , Shaoxin Yuan, , Linjie Zhang, ,, Liantuan Xiao, , and Suotang Jia,	None	\authormark1State Key Laboratory of Quantum Optics and Quantum Optics Devices, Institute of Laser Spectroscopy, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030006, China\authormark2Collaborative Innovation Cen	Ultra-low frequency noise lasers have been widely used in laser-based experiments. Most narrow-linewidth lasers are implemented by actively suppressing their frequency noise through a frequency noise servo loop (FNSL). The loop bandwidths (LBW) of FNSLs are currently below megahertz, which is gradually tricky to meet application requirements, especially for wideband quantum sensing experiments. This article has experimentally implemented an FNSL with loop-delay-limited 3.5 MHz LBW, which is an order higher than the usual FNSLs. Using this FNSL, we achieved 70 dB laser frequency noise suppression over 100 kHz Fourier frequency range. This technology has broad applications in vast fields where wideband laser frequency noise suppression is inevitable.

The near SOL pressure and density decay lengths are obtained by leveraging a balance among the power source, perpendicular turbulent transport across the separatrix, and parallel losses at the vessel wall, while the far SOL pressure and density decay lengths are derived by using a model of intermittent transport mediated by filaments. The analytical estimates of the pressure decay length in the near SOL is then compared to the results of three-dimensional, flux-driven, global, two-fluid turbulence simulations of L-mode diverted tokamak plasmas, and validated against experimental measurements taken from an experimental multi-machine database of divertor heat flux profiles, showing in both cases a very good agreement. Analogously, the theoretical scaling law for the pressure decay length in the far SOL is compared to simulation results and to experimental measurements in TCV L-mode discharges, pointing out the need of a large multi-machine database for the far SOL decay lengths.

In this article, we adapt the developed method to the non stationary signal in using the sliding window, and propose a noise variance monitoring method.

 A Measurement of Source Noise at Low Frequency: Implications for Modern Interferometers	Morgan, startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTR Ekers, ,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We report on the detection of source noise in the time domain at 162 MHz with the Murchison Widefield Array. During the observation the flux of our target source Virgo A (M87) contributes only ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 1% to the total power detected by any single antenna, thus this source noise detection is made in an intermediate regime, where the source flux detected by the entire array is comparable with the noise from a single antenna. The magnitude of source noise detected is precisely in line with predictions. We consider the implications of source noise in this moderately strong regime on observations with current and future instruments.	
 A review of deep-learning techniques for SAR image restoration			None	The speckle phenomenon remains a major hurdle for the analysis of SAR images. The development of speckle reduction methods closely follows methodological progress in the field of image restoration. The advent of deep neural networks has offered new ways to tackle this longstanding problem. Deep learning for speckle reduction is a very active research topic and already shows restoration performances that exceed that of the previous generations of methods based on the concepts of patches, sparsity, wavelet transform or total variation minimization.

 Similarities and differences in accretion flow properties between GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624: a case study	Anuvab, Ayan, Dipak, Sandip	None	S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Salt Lake, Kolkata 700106, India	We perform a comparative spectro-temporal analysis on the variability classes of GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624 to draw inferences regarding the underlying accretion flow mechanism. The ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ , as well as C2 class Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer observation, have been considered for analysis. We investigate the intensity variation of the source in different energy domains that correspond to different components of the accretion flow and infer the relative dominance of these flow components during the dip/flare events. We correlate the dependence of the dynamic photon index ( Œò Œò \Theta roman_Œò ) with intensities in different energy bands and comment on the transition of the source to hard/soft phases during soft dips/flares. We also report the presence of sharp QPOs at ‚àº 7.1 similar-to absent 7.1 \sim 7.1 ‚àº 7.1 Hz corresponding to both softer and harder domain in the case of ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ variability class of GRS 1915+105 and discuss the possible accretion flow configuration it suggests. Sharp QPO around ‚àº 20 similar-to absent 20 \sim 20 ‚àº 20 mHz is observed in ŒΩ ùúà \nu italic_ŒΩ and C2 classes of IGR J17091-3624 in low and mid energy band (2.0-6.0 keV and 6.0-15.0 keV), but remains undetected in high energy (15.0-60.0 keV). The 2.5-25.0 keV background-subtracted spectra have also been fitted with TCAF along with a Compton reflection component. A plausible accretion flow mechanism in order to explain the observed variability has been proposed.	
 The Tight Bound for Pure Price of Anarchy in an Extended Miner‚Äôs Dilemma Game	Qian Wang, Yurong Chen	charlie@pku.edu.cn	None	Pool block withholding attack is performed among mining pools in digital cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Instead of mining honestly, pools can be incentivized to infiltrate their own miners into other pools. These infiltrators report partial solutions but withhold full solutions, share block rewards but make no contribution to block mining. The block withholding attack among mining pools can be modeled as a non-cooperative game called ‚Äúthe miner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù, which reduces effective mining power in the system and leads to potential systemic instability in the blockchain. However, existing literature on the game-theoretic properties of this attack only gives a preliminary analysis, e.g., an upper bound of 3 3 3 3 for the pure price of anarchy ( PPoA PPoA \mathrm{PPoA} roman_PPoA ) in this game, with two pools involved and no miner betraying. Pure price of anarchy is a measurement of how much mining power is wasted in the miner‚Äôs dilemma game. Further tightening its upper bound will bring us more insight into the structure of this game, so as to design mechanisms to reduce the systemic loss caused by mutual attacks. In this paper, we give a tight bound of ( 1 , 2 ] 1 2 (1,2] ( 1 , 2 ] for the pure price of anarchy. Moreover, we show the tight bound holds in a more general setting, in which infiltrators may betray. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of pure Nash equilibrium in this setting. Inspired by experiments on the game among three mining pools, we conjecture that similar results hold in the N-player miner‚Äôs dilemma game ( N ‚â• 2 ùëÅ 2 N\geq 2 italic_N ‚â• 2 ).	
 GPU Optimization for High-Quality Kinetic Fluid Simulation	Yixin Chen,Wei Li,Rui Fan,and Xiaopei Liu	None	None	Fluid simulations are often performed using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), leading to sparse linear systems which are difficult to solve efficiently in parallel. Recently, kinetic methods based on the adaptive-central-moment multiple-relaxation-time (ACM-MRT) model [ 1 , 2 ] have demonstrated impressive capabilities to simulate both laminar and turbulent flows, with quality matching or surpassing that of state-of-the-art INSE solvers. Furthermore, due to its local formulation, this method presents the opportunity for highly scalable implementations on parallel systems such as GPUs. However, an efficient ACM-MRT-based kinetic solver needs to overcome a number of computational challenges, especially when dealing with complex solids inside the fluid domain. In this paper, we present multiple novel GPU optimization techniques to efficiently implement high-quality ACM-MRT-based kinetic fluid simulations in domains containing complex solids. Our techniques include a new communication-efficient data layout, a load-balanced immersed-boundary method, a multi-kernel launch method using a simplified formulation of ACM-MRT calculations to enable greater parallelism, and the integration of these techniques into a parametric cost model to enable automated parameter search to achieve optimal execution performance. We also extended our method to multi-GPU systems to enable large-scale simulations. To demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and high visual quality of our solver, we present extensive experimental results and comparisons to other solvers.

 Interpreting and Unifying Graph Neural Networks with An Optimization Framework	Meiqi Zhu, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi, Houye Ji, Peng Cui	zhumeiqi@bupt.edu.cn	None	Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received considerable attention on graph-structured data learning for a wide variety of tasks. The well-designed propagation mechanism which has been demonstrated effective is the most fundamental part of GNNs. Although most of GNNs basically follow a message passing manner, litter effort has been made to discover and analyze their essential relations. In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between different propagation mechanisms with a unified optimization problem, showing that despite the proliferation of various GNNs, in fact, their proposed propagation mechanisms are the optimal solution optimizing a feature fitting function over a wide class of graph kernels with a graph regularization term. Our proposed unified optimization framework, summarizing the commonalities between several of the most representative GNNs, not only provides a macroscopic view on surveying the relations between different GNNs, but also further opens up new opportunities for flexibly designing new GNNs. With the proposed framework, we discover that existing works usually utilize na√Øve graph convolutional kernels for feature fitting function, and we further develop two novel objective functions considering adjustable graph kernels showing low-pass or high-pass filtering capabilities respectively. Moreover, we provide the convergence proofs and expressive power comparisons for the proposed models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets clearly show that the proposed GNNs not only outperform the state-of-the-art methods but also have good ability to alleviate over-smoothing, and further verify the feasibility for designing GNNs with our unified optimization framework.

 Integral Representation of Hydraulic Permeability	Chuan Bi, Yvonne Ou, Shangyou Zhang	None	None	In this paper, we show that the permeability of a porous material [ 40 ] and that of a bubbly fluid [ 29 ] are limiting cases of the complexified version of the two-fluid models posed in [ 29 ] . We assume the viscosity of the inclusion fluid is z Œº 1 ùëß subscript ùúá 1 z\mu_{1} italic_z italic_Œº start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the viscosity of the hosting fluid is Œº 1 ‚àà ‚Ñù + subscript ùúá 1 superscript ‚Ñù \mu_{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{+} italic_Œº start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àà blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , z ‚àà ‚ÑÇ ùëß ‚ÑÇ z\in\mathbb{C} italic_z ‚àà blackboard_C .

 Exploiting the Hidden Tasks of GANs: Making Implicit Subproblems Explicit	Romann MWeberDisneyResearchStudiosZurich, Switzerland	None	None	We present an alternative perspective on the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs), showing that the training step for a GAN generator decomposes into two implicit subproblems. In the first, the discriminator provides new target data to the generator in the form of inverse examples produced by approximately inverting classifier labels. In the second, these examples are used as targets to update the generator via least-squares regression, regardless of the main loss specified to train the network. We experimentally validate our main theoretical result and demonstrate significant improvements over standard GAN training made possible by making these subproblems explicit.

 Large Scale Analysis of Multitasking Behavior During Remote Meetings	Hancheng Cao, ChiaJung Lee, Shamsi Iqbal, Mary Czerwinski, Priscilla Wong, Sean Rintel, Brent Hecht, Jaime Teevan, Longqi Yang	hanchcao@stanford.edu	None	Virtual meetings are critical for remote work because of the need for synchronous collaboration in the absence of in-person interactions. In-meeting multitasking is closely linked to people‚Äôs productivity and wellbeing. However, we currently have limited understanding of multitasking in remote meetings and its potential impact. In this paper, we present what we believe is the most comprehensive study of remote meeting multitasking behavior through an analysis of a large-scale telemetry dataset collected from February to May 2020 of U.S. Microsoft employees and a 715-person diary study. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic meeting characteristics such as size, length, time, and type, significantly correlate with the extent to which people multitask, and multitasking can lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Our findings suggest important best-practice guidelines for remote meetings (e.g., avoid important meetings in the morning) and design implications for productivity tools (e.g., support positive remote multitasking).

 Simulating low-energy neutrino interactions with MARLEY	Gardiner	None	"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, P.O. Box 500, Batavia,
IL 60510, USA"	Monte Carlo event generators are a critical tool for the interpretation of data obtained by neutrino experiments. Several modern event generators are available which are well-suited to the GeV energy scale used in studies of accelerator neutrinos. However, theoretical modeling differences make their immediate application to lower energies difficult. In this paper, I present a new event generator, MARLEY , which is designed to better address the simulation needs of the low-energy (tens of MeV and below) neutrino community. The code is written in C ++ 14 with an optional interface to the popular ROOT data analysis framework. The current release of MARLEY (version 1.2.0) emphasizes simulations of the reaction \isotope [ 40 ] A r ( ŒΩ e , e ‚àí ) \isotope [ 40 ] K * \isotope delimited-[] 40 ùê¥ ùëü subscript ùúà ùëí superscript ùëí \isotope delimited-[] 40 superscript ùêæ \isotope[40]{Ar}(\nu_{e},e^{-})\isotope[40]{K}^{*} [ 40 ] italic_A italic_r ( italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) [ 40 ] italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT but is extensible to other channels with suitable user input.

 On solving classes of positive-definite quantum linear systems with quadratically improved runtime in the condition number	Davide Orsucci, Vedran Dunjko	None	None	Quantum algorithms for solving the Quantum Linear System (QLS) problem are among the most investigated quantum algorithms of recent times, with potential applications including the solution of computationally intractable differential equations and speed-ups in machine learning. A fundamental parameter governing the efficiency of QLS solvers is Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ , the condition number of the coefficient matrix A ùê¥ A italic_A , as it has been known since the inception of the QLS problem that for worst-case instances the runtime scales at least linearly in Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ [ 1 ] . However, for the case of positive-definite matrices classical algorithms can solve linear systems with a runtime scaling as Œ∫ ùúÖ \sqrt{\kappa} square-root start_ARG italic_Œ∫ end_ARG , a quadratic improvement compared to the the indefinite case. It is then natural to ask whether QLS solvers may hold an analogous improvement. In this work we answer the question in the negative, showing that solving a QLS entails a runtime linear in Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ also when A ùê¥ A italic_A is positive definite. We then identify broad classes of positive-definite QLS where this lower bound can be circumvented and present two new quantum algorithms featuring a quadratic speed-up in Œ∫ ùúÖ \kappa italic_Œ∫ : the first is based on efficiently implementing a matrix-block-encoding of A ‚àí 1 superscript ùê¥ 1 A^{-1} italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , the second constructs a decomposition of the form A = L L ‚Ä† ùê¥ ùêø superscript ùêø ‚Ä† A=LL^{\dagger} italic_A = italic_L italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to precondition the system. These methods are widely applicable and both allow to efficiently solve BQP -complete problems.

 Strategic Argumentation Dialogues for Persuasion: Framework and Experiments Based on Modelling the Beliefs and Concerns of the Persuadee	Emmanuel Hadoux, Anthony Hunter, Sylwia Polberg	None	None	Persuasion is an important and yet complex aspect of human intelligence. When undertaken through dialogue, the deployment of good arguments, and therefore counterarguments, clearly has a significant effect on the ability to be successful in persuasion. Two key dimensions for determining whether an argument is ‚Äúgood‚Äù in a particular dialogue are the degree to which the intended audience believes the argument and counterarguments, and the impact that the argument has on the concerns of the intended audience. In this paper, we present a framework for modelling persuadees in terms of their beliefs and concerns, and for harnessing these models in optimizing the choice of move in persuasion dialogues. Our approach is based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search which allows optimization in real-time. We provide empirical results of a study with human participants showing that our automated persuasion system based on this technology is superior to a baseline system that does not take the beliefs and concerns into account in its strategy.	
 Website Fingerprinting on Early QUIC Traffic	Pengwei Zhan, Liming Wang, Yi Tang	zhanpengwei@iie.ac.cn	Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China	Cryptographic protocols have been widely used to protect the user‚Äôs privacy and avoid exposing private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), including the version originally designed by Google (GQUIC) and the version standardized by IETF (IQUIC), as alternatives to the traditional HTTP, demonstrate their unique transmission characteristics: based on UDP for encrypted resource transmitting, accelerating web page rendering. However, existing encrypted transmission schemes based on TCP are vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing adversaries to infer the users‚Äô visited websites by eavesdropping on the transmission channel. Whether GQUIC and IQUIC can effectively resist such attacks is worth investigating. In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities of GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS to WFP attacks from the perspective of traffic analysis. Extensive experiments show that, in the early traffic scenario, GQUIC is the most vulnerable to WFP attacks among GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS, while IQUIC is more vulnerable than HTTPS, but the vulnerability of the three protocols is similar in the normal full traffic scenario. Features transferring analysis shows that most features are transferable between protocols when on normal full traffic scenario, which enable the adversary to use features proven effective on a special protocol efficiently attacking a new protocol. However, combining with the qualitative analysis of latent feature representation, we find that the transferring is inefficient when on early traffic, as GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS show the significantly different magnitude of variation in the traffic distribution on early traffic. By upgrading the one-time WFP attacks to multiple WFP Top- a ùëé a italic_a attacks, we find that the attack accuracy on GQUIC and IQUIC reach 95.4% and 95.5%, respectively, with only 40 packets and just using simple features, whereas reach only 60.7% when on HTTPS. Finally, by conducting the attacks on flawed networks, we also demonstrate that the vulnerability of IQUIC is only slightly dependent on the network environment.	
 Robust Extrinsic Regression Analysis for Manifold Valued Data	Hwiyoung Lee	None	None	Recently, there has been a growing need in analyzing data on manifolds owing to their important role in diverse fields of science and engineering. In the literature of manifold-valued data analysis up till now, however, only a few works have been carried out concerning the robustness of estimation against noises, outliers, and other sources of perturbations. In this regard, we introduce a novel extrinsic framework for analyzing manifold valued data in a robust manner. First, by extending the notion of the geometric median, we propose a new robust location parameter on manifolds, so-called the extrinsic median. A robust extrinsic regression method is also developed by incorporating the conditional extrinsic median into the classical local polynomial regression method. We present the Weiszfeld‚Äôs algorithm for implementing the proposed methods. The promising performance of our approach against existing methods is illustrated through simulation studies.	
 A Graph-based Relevance Matching Model for Ad-hoc Retrieval		None	None	To retrieve more relevant, appropriate and useful documents given a query, finding clues about that query through the text is crucial. Recent deep learning models regard the task as a term-level matching problem, which seeks exact or similar query patterns in the document. However, we argue that they are inherently based on local interactions and do not generalise to ubiquitous, non-consecutive contextual relationships. In this work, we propose a novel relevance matching model based on graph neural networks to leverage the document-level word relationships for ad-hoc retrieval. In addition to the local interactions, we explicitly incorporate all contexts of a term through the graph-of-word text format. Matching patterns can be revealed accordingly to provide a more accurate relevance score. Our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on two ad-hoc benchmarks. We also experimentally compare our model with BERT and show our advantages on long documents.

 Cosmological test of an extended quintessence model	Gong Cheng, Fengquan Wu, Xuelei Chen	None	None	We investigate the cosmological observational test of the extended quintessence model, i.e. a scalar-tensor gravity model with a scalar field potential serving as dark energy, by using the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, together with the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) data. As an example, we consider the model with a Brans-Dicke kinetic term œâ ( œï ) œï œï ; Œº œï ; Œº \frac{\omega(\phi)}{\phi}\phi_{;\mu}\phi^{;\mu} divide start_ARG italic_œâ ( italic_œï ) end_ARG start_ARG italic_œï end_ARG italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ; italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œï start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ; italic_Œº end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and a quadratic scalar potential V ( œï ) = A + B ( œï ‚àí œï 0 ) + C 2 ( œï ‚àí œï 0 ) 2 ùëâ italic-œï ùê¥ ùêµ italic-œï subscript italic-œï 0 ùê∂ 2 superscript italic-œï subscript italic-œï 0 2 V(\phi)=A+B(\phi-\phi_{0})+\frac{C}{2}(\phi-\phi_{0})^{2} italic_V ( italic_œï ) = italic_A + italic_B ( italic_œï - italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) + divide start_ARG italic_C end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ( italic_œï - italic_œï start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , which reduces to general relativity (GR) in the limit œâ ( œï ) ‚Üí ‚àû ‚Üí ùúî italic-œï \omega(\phi)\to\infty italic_œâ ( italic_œï ) ‚Üí ‚àû , and the cosmological constant in the limit B = C = 0 ùêµ ùê∂ 0 B=C=0 italic_B = italic_C = 0 . In such a model the scalar field typically rolls down the potential and oscillates around the minimum of V ( œï ) ùëâ italic-œï V(\phi) italic_V ( italic_œï ) .

However, the GR Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM model can fit the data almost as good as this extended quintessence model, and is favored by the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

The future antiProton ANnihilations at DArmstadt (PANDA or P ¬Ø ¬Ø P \overline{\rm P} over¬Ø start_ARG roman_P end_ARG ANDA) experiment at FAIR will offer a broad physics programme, covering different aspects of the strong interaction. Understanding the latter in the non-perturbative regime remains one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics. The antiproton-nucleon interaction studied with PANDA provides crucial tests in this area. Furthermore, the high-intensity, low-energy domain of PANDA allows for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, e.g. through high precision symmetry tests. This paper takes into account a staged approach for the detector setup and for the delivered luminosity from the accelerator. The available detector setup at the time of the delivery of the first antiproton beams in the HESR storage ring is referred to as the Phase One setup. The physics programme that is achievable during Phase One is outlined in this paper.	
 COMPAS: Representation Learning with Compositional Part Sharing for Few-Shot Classification	Ju He Adam Kortylewski Alan YuilleJohns Hopkins University	None	None	Few-shot image classification consists of two consecutive learning processes: 1) In the meta-learning stage, the model acquires a knowledge base from a set of training classes. 2) During meta-testing, the acquired knowledge is used to recognize unseen classes from very few examples. Inspired by the compositional representation of objects in humans, we train a neural network architecture that explicitly represents objects as a set of parts and their spatial composition. In particular, during meta-learning, we train a knowledge base that consists of a dictionary of part representations and a dictionary of part activation maps that encode common spatial activation patterns of parts. The elements of both dictionaries are shared among the training classes. During meta-testing, the representation of unseen classes is learned using the part representations and the part activation maps from the knowledge base. Finally, an attention mechanism is used to strengthen those parts that are most important for each category. We demonstrate the value of our compositional learning framework for a few-shot classification using miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance.

 Forecast for cosmological parameter estimation with gravitational-wave standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network	LingFeng Wang, ShangJie Jin, JingFei Zhang, Xin Zhang	None	None	LISA and Taiji are expected to form a space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detection network in the future. In this work, we make a forecast for the cosmological parameter estimation with the standard siren observation from the LISA-Taiji network. We simulate the standard siren data based on a scenario with configuration angle of 40 ‚àò superscript 40 40^{\circ} 40 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT between LISA and Taiji. Three models for the population of massive black hole binary (MBHB), i.e., pop III, Q3d, and Q3nod, are considered to predict the events of MBHB mergers. We find that, based on the LISA-Taiji network, the number of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts detected is almost doubled compared with the case of single Taiji mission. Therefore, the LISA-Taiji network‚Äôs standard siren observation could provide much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters. For example, solely using the standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network, the constraint precision of H 0 subscript ùêª 0 H_{0} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT could reach 1.3 % percent 1.3 1.3\% 1.3 % . Moreover, combined with the CMB data, the GW-EM observation based on the LISA-Taiji network could also tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy, e.g., the constraint precision of w ùë§ w italic_w reaches about 4 % percent 4 4\% 4 % , which is comparable with the result of CMB+BAO+SN. It is concluded that the GW standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network will become a useful cosmological probe in understanding the nature of dark energy in the future.	
 Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search Supporting Approximate Multipliers	Michal Pinos, Vojtech Mrazek, and Lukas Sekanina	None	None	There is a growing interest in automated neural architecture search (NAS) methods. They are employed to routinely deliver high-quality neural network architectures for various challenging data sets and reduce the designer‚Äôs effort. The NAS methods utilizing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are especially useful when the objective is not only to minimize the network error but also to minimize the number of parameters (weights) or power consumption of the inference phase. We propose a multi-objective NAS method based on Cartesian genetic programming for evolving convolutional neural networks (CNN). The method allows approximate operations to be used in CNNs to reduce power consumption of a target hardware implementation. During the NAS process, a suitable CNN architecture is evolved together with approximate multipliers to deliver the best trade-offs between the accuracy, network size and power consumption. The most suitable approximate multipliers are automatically selected from a library of approximate multipliers. Evolved CNNs are compared with common human-created CNNs of a similar complexity on the CIFAR-10 benchmark problem.	
 On Geometrical Couplings of Dissipation and Curl Forces			None	In this paper, we present several geometric ways to incorporate gyroscopic and dissipative forces to curl forces. We first present a proper metriplectic geometry. Then, using the Herglotz principle and generalized Euler-Lagrange equation, we propose a formulation of dissipative radial curl forces. Finally, we extend our result to azimuthal curl force using Galley‚Äôs method, which leads to a natural formulation for Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of generic non-conservative systems.

 Automated Insulin Delivery for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients using Gaussian Process-based Model Predictive Control	Lukas OrtmannstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Dawei ShistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Eyal DassaustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Francis Doyle IIIstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Berno JE MisgeldstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Steffen LeonhardtstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The human insulin-glucose metabolism is a time-varying process, which is partly caused by the changing insulin sensitivity of the body. This insulin sensitivity follows a circadian rhythm and its effects should be anticipated by any automated insulin delivery system. This paper presents an extension of our previous work on automated insulin delivery by developing a controller suitable for humans with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Furthermore, we enhance the controller with a new kernel function for the Gaussian Process and deal with noisy measurements, as well as, the noisy training data for the Gaussian Process, arising therefrom. This enables us to move the proposed control algorithm, a combination of Model Predictive Controller and a Gaussian Process, closer towards clinical application. Simulation results on the University of Virginia/Padova FDA-accepted metabolic simulator are presented for a meal schedule with random carbohydrate sizes and random times of carbohydrate uptake to show the performance of the proposed control scheme.	
 Does Typological Blinding Impede Cross-Lingual Sharing?	Johannes BjervaDepartment of Computer ScienceAalborg UniversityIsabelle AugensteinDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of Copenhagen	None	None	Bridging the performance gap between high- and low-resource languages has been the focus of much previous work. Typological features from databases such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) are a prime candidate for this, as such data exists even for very low-resource languages. However, previous work has only found minor benefits from using typological information. Our hypothesis is that a model trained in a cross-lingual setting will pick up on typological cues from the input data, thus overshadowing the utility of explicitly using such features. We verify this hypothesis by blinding a model to typological information, and investigate how cross-lingual sharing and performance is impacted. Our model is based on a cross-lingual architecture in which the latent weights governing the sharing between languages is learnt during training. We show that (i) preventing this model from exploiting typology severely reduces performance, while a control experiment reaffirms that (ii) encouraging sharing according to typology somewhat improves performance.	
 Contents			None	English Abstract Deep neural networks are powerful statistical learners. However, their predictions do not come with an explanation of their process. To analyze these models, explanation methods are being developed. We present a novel explanation method, called OLM , for natural language processing classifiers. This method combines occlusion and language modeling, which are techniques central to explainability and NLP, respectively. OLM gives explanations that are theoretically sound and easy to understand.	
 Automatic design of novel potential 3CLpro and PLpro inhibitors	Timothy Atkinson, Saeed Saremi, Faustino Gomez, Jonathan Masci	None	None	With the goal of designing novel inhibitors for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we propose the general molecule optimization framework, Mo lecular N eural A ssay S earch (MONAS), consisting of three components: a property predictor which identifies molecules with specific desirable properties, an energy model which approximates the statistical similarity of a given molecule to known training molecules, and a molecule search method. In this work, these components are instantiated with graph neural networks (GNNs), Deep Energy Estimator Networks (DEEN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), respectively. This implementation is used to identify 120K molecules (out of 40-million explored) which the GNN determined to be likely SARS-CoV-1 inhibitors, and, at the same time, are statistically close to the dataset used to train the GNN.	
 LESA: Linguistic Encapsulation and Semantic Amalgamation Based Generalised Claim Detection from Online Content	Shreya GuptadaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Parantak SinghddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Megha SundriyaldaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,daggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,	None	None	The conceptualization of a claim lies at the core of argument mining. The segregation of claims is complex, owing to the divergence in textual syntax and context across different distributions. Another pressing issue is the unavailability of labeled unstructured text for experimentation. In this paper, we propose LESA , a framework which aims at advancing headfirst into expunging the former issue by assembling a source-independent generalized model that captures syntactic features through part-of-speech and dependency embeddings, as well as contextual features through a fine-tuned language model. We resolve the latter issue by annotating a Twitter dataset which aims at providing a testing ground on a large unstructured dataset. Experimental results show that LESA improves upon the state-of-the-art performance across six benchmark claim datasets by an average of 3 claim-F1 points for in-domain experiments and by 2 claim-F1 points for general-domain experiments. On our dataset too, LESA outperforms existing baselines by 1 claim-F1 point on the in-domain experiments and 2 claim-F1 points on the general-domain experiments. We also release comprehensive data annotation guidelines compiled during the annotation phase (which was missing in the current literature).	
 Influence of Furnace Baking on Q-E Behavior of Superconducting Accelerating Cavities	Ito, Araki, Takahashi, Umemori	hayato.ito@kek.jp	None	The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities depends on the niobium surface condition. Recently, various heat-treatment methods have been investigated to achieve unprecedented high quality factor (Q) and high accelerating field (E). We report the influence of a new baking process called furnace baking on the Q-E behavior of 1.3 GHz SRF cavities. Furnace baking is performed as the final step of the cavity surface treatment; the cavities are heated in a vacuum furnace for 3 h, followed by high-pressure rinsing and radio-frequency measurement. This method is simpler and potentially more reliable than previously reported heat-treatment methods, and it is therefore, easier to apply to the SRF cavities. We find that the quality factor is increased after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 300 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C to 400 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C, while strong decreasing the quality factor at high accelerating field is observed after furnace baking at temperatures ranging from 600 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C to 800 ‚àò {}^{\circ} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT C. We find significant differences in the surface resistance for various processing temperatures.	
 Quasideterminant Solutions of Noncommutative Equation of Langmuir Oscillations	Irfan Mahmood, Hira Sohail	None	Centre for High Energy Physics, University of the Punjab, 54590, Lahore, Pakistan	In this article we present nonncommutative analogue of equation of Langmuir oscillations and its Darbboux solutions in additive form with their N ùëÅ N italic_N -th generalization in terms of quasideterminants. We also derive the noncommutative ricatti equation from its linear system that yields the B√§cklund transformation for the commutative version of equation of Langmuir oscillations with classical limit. The last section, involves the derivation of reduction of that B√§cklund transformation to the Darboux solutions under commutative limit.	
 Metastability for the Ising model on the hexagonal lattice	Valentina Apollonio, Vanessa Jacquier, Francesca Romana Nardi, Alessio Troiani	None	"Dipartimento di Matematica e Fisica,
Universit√† Roma Tre"	We consider the Ising model on the hexagonal lattice evolving according to Metropolis dynamics. We study its metastable behavior in the limit of vanishing temperature when the system is immersed in a small external magnetic field. We determine the asymptotic properties of the transition time from the metastable to the stable state up to a multiplicative factor and study the mixing time and the spectral gap of the Markov process. We give a geometrical description of the critical configurations and show how not only their size but their shape varies depending on the thermodynamical parameters. Finally we provide some results concerning polyiamonds of maximal area and minimal perimeter.	
 Survival probability of a run-and-tumble particle in the presence of a drift	Benjamin De Bruyne, Satya Majumdar, Grgory Schehr	None	LPTMS, CNRS, Univ.¬†Paris-Sud, Universit√© Paris-Saclay, 91405 Orsay, France	We consider a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle, or persistent random walk, in the presence of an absorbing boundary located at the origin. After each tumbling event, which occurs at a constant rate Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ , the (new) velocity of the particle is drawn randomly from a distribution W ( v ) ùëä ùë£ W(v) italic_W ( italic_v ) . We study the survival probability S ( x , t ) ùëÜ ùë• ùë° S(x,t) italic_S ( italic_x , italic_t ) of a particle starting from x ‚â• 0 ùë• 0 x\geq 0 italic_x ‚â• 0 up to time t ùë° t italic_t and obtain an explicit expression for its double Laplace transform (with respect to both x ùë• x italic_x and t ùë° t italic_t ) for an arbitrary velocity distribution W ( v ) ùëä ùë£ W(v) italic_W ( italic_v ) , not necessarily symmetric. This result is obtained as a consequence of Spitzer‚Äôs formula, which is well known in the theory of random walks and can be viewed as a generalization of the Sparre Andersen theorem. We then apply this general result to the specific case of a two-state particle with velocity ¬± v 0 plus-or-minus subscript ùë£ 0 \pm v_{0} ¬± italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , the so-called persistent random walk (PRW), and in the presence of a constant drift Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº and obtain an explicit expression for S ( x , t ) ùëÜ ùë• ùë° S(x,t) italic_S ( italic_x , italic_t ) , for which we present more detailed results. Depending on the drift Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº , we find a rich variety of behaviours for S ( x , t ) ùëÜ ùë• ùë° S(x,t) italic_S ( italic_x , italic_t ) , leading to three distinct cases: (i) subcritical drift ‚àí v 0 < Œº < v 0 subscript ùë£ 0 ùúá subscript ùë£ 0 -v_{0}\!<\!\mu\!<\!v_{0} - italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_Œº < italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , (ii) supercritical drift Œº < ‚àí v 0 ùúá subscript ùë£ 0 \mu<-v_{0} italic_Œº < - italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and (iii) critical drift Œº = ‚àí v 0 ùúá subscript ùë£ 0 \mu=-v_{0} italic_Œº = - italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . In these three cases, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the survival probability S ( x , t ) ùëÜ ùë• ùë° S(x,t) italic_S ( italic_x , italic_t ) and establish connections with existing formulae in the mathematics literature. Finally, we discuss some applications of these results to record statistics and to the statistics of last-passage times.	
 Self-supervised Cross-silo Federated Neural Architecture Search	XinleLiang,, YangLiu,,JiahuanLuo, YuanqinHe, Tianjian Chen,andQiangYang	None	None	Federated Learning (FL) provides both model performance and data privacy for machine learning tasks where samples or features are distributed among different parties. In the training process of FL, no party has a global view of data distributions or model architectures of other parties. Thus the manually-designed architectures may not be optimal. In the past, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to FL to address this critical issue. However, existing Federated NAS approaches require prohibitive communication and computation effort, as well as the availability of high-quality labels. In this work, we present Self-supervised Vertical Federated Neural Architecture Search (SS-VFNAS) for automating FL where participants hold feature-partitioned data, a common cross-silo scenario called Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). In the proposed framework, each party first conducts NAS using self-supervised approach to find a local optimal architecture with its own data. Then, parties collaboratively improve the local optimal architecture in a VFL framework with supervision. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach has superior performance, communication efficiency and privacy compared to Federated NAS and is capable of generating high-performance and highly-transferable heterogeneous architectures even with insufficient overlapping samples, providing automation for those parties without deep learning expertise. 1 1 1 This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

 Deep ReLU Network Expression Rates for Option Prices in high-dimensional, exponential L√©vy models	Lukas Gonon, Christoph Schwab	gonon@math.lmu.de	Department of Mathematics, University of Munich, Theresienstrasse 39, 80333 Munich, Germany	We study the expression rates of deep neural networks (DNNs for short) for option prices written on baskets of d ùëë d italic_d risky assets, whose log-returns are modelled by a multivariate L√©vy process with general correlation structure of jumps.

 HEMVIP: Human Evaluation of Multiple Videos in Parallel	Patrik Jonell, Youngwoo Yoon, Pieter Wolfert, Taras Kucherenko, Gustav Eje Henter	pjjonell@kth.se	None	In many research areas, for example motion and gesture generation, objective measures alone do not provide an accurate impression of key stimulus traits such as perceived quality or appropriateness. The gold standard is instead to evaluate these aspects through user studies, especially subjective evaluations of video stimuli. Common evaluation paradigms either present individual stimuli to be scored on Likert-type scales, or ask users to compare and rate videos in a pairwise fashion. However, the time and resources required for such evaluations scale poorly as the number of conditions to be compared increases. Building on standards used for evaluating the quality of multimedia codecs, this paper instead introduces a framework for granular rating of multiple comparable videos in parallel. This methodology essentially analyses all condition pairs at once. Our contributions are 1) a proposed framework, called HEMVIP, for parallel and granular evaluation of multiple video stimuli and 2) a validation study confirming that results obtained using the tool are in close agreement with results of prior studies using conventional multiple pairwise comparisons.	
 On properly stratified Gorenstein algebras	Tiago Cruz, Ren Marczinzik	tiago.cruz@mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de	Institute of algebra and number theory, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 57, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany	We show that a properly stratified algebra is Gorenstein if and only if the characteristic tilting module coincides with the characteristic cotilting module. We further show that properly stratified Gorenstein algebras A ùê¥ A italic_A enjoy strong homological properties such as all Gorenstein projective modules being properly stratified and all endomorphism rings End A ‚Å° ( Œî ( i ) ) subscript End ùê¥ Œî ùëñ \operatorname{End}_{A}(\Delta(i)) roman_End start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_A end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( roman_Œî ( italic_i ) ) being Frobenius algebras.

This applies in particular to all centraliser algebras of nilpotent matrices.	
 Quantum speed limit and divisibility of the dynamical map	TeittinenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Maniscalco,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	jostei@utu.fi	11{}^{1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTTurku Centre for Quantum Physics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Turku, Finland	The quantum speed limit (QSL) is the theoretical lower limit of the time for a quantum system to evolve from a given state to another one. Interestingly, it has been shown that non-Markovianity can be used to speed-up the dynamics [ 1 ] and to lower the QSL time, although this behavior is not universal [ 2 ] . In this paper we further carry on the investigation on the connection between QSL and non-Markovianity by looking at the effects of P- and CP-divisibility of the dynamical map to the quantum speed limit. We show that the speed-up can also be observed under P- and CP-divisible dynamics, and that the speed-up is not necessarily tied to the transition from P-divisible to non-P-divisible dynamics.	
 The sooner the better: lives saved by the lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak.

We use a new estimator, the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM), that overcomes some limits of the standard Synthetic Control Method (SCM). The results are twofold. From a methodological point of view, the ASCM outperforms the SCM in that the latter cannot select a valid donor set, assigning all the weights to only one country (Spain) while placing zero weights to all the remaining. From an empirical point of view, we find strong evidence of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in avoiding losses of human lives in Italy: conservative estimates indicate that for each human life actually lost, in the absence of lockdown there would have been on average other 1.15, the policy saved in total 20,400 human lives.	
 Learning Hidden Chemistry with Deep Neural Networks	TienCuong Nguyen, VanQuyen Nguyen, VanLinh Ngo, QuangKhoat Than, TienLam Pham	None	VNU-University of Science, 334 Nguyen Trai, Thanh Xuan Dist., Hanoi, Vietnam	We demonstrate a machine learning approach designed to extract hidden chemistry/physics to facilitate new materials discovery. In particular, we propose a novel method for learning latent knowledge from material structure data in which machine learning models are developed to present the possibility that an atom can be paired with a chemical environment in an observed materials. For this purpose, we trained deep neural networks acquiring information from the atom of interest and its environment to estimate the possibility. The models were then used to establish recommendation systems, which can suggest a list of atoms for an environment within a structure. The center atom of that environment was then replaced with the various recommended atoms to generate new structures. Based on these recommendations, we also propose a method of dissimilarity measurement between the atoms and, through hierarchical cluster analysis and visualization using the multidimensional scaling algorithm, illustrate that this dissimilarity can reflect the chemistry of the elements. Finally, our models were applied to the discovery of new structures in the well-known magnetic material Nd 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Fe 14 14 {}_{14} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT B. Our models propose 108 new structures, 71 of which are confirmed to converge to local-minimum-energy structures with formation energy less than 0.1 eV by first-principles calculations.	
 Low-density neutron matter and the unitary limit	Isaac Vidaa	None	None	We review the properties of neutron matter in the low-density regime. In particular, we revise its ground state energy and the superfluid neutron pairing gap, and analyze their evolution from the weak to the strong coupling regime. The calculations of the energy and the pairing gap are performed, respectively, within the Brueckner‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock approach of nuclear matter and the BCS theory using the chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction of Entem and Machleidt at N 3 3 {}^{3} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT LO and the Argonne V18 phenomenological potential. Results for the energy are also shown for a simple Gaussian potential with a strength and range adjusted to reproduce the S 0 1 superscript subscript ùëÜ 0 1 {}^{1}S_{0} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT neutron-neutron scattering length and effective range. Our results are compared with those of quantum Monte Carlo calculations for neutron matter and cold atoms. The Tan contact parameter in neutron matter is also calculated finding a reasonable agreement with experimental data with ultra-cold atoms only at very low densities. We find that low-density neutron matter exhibits a behavior close to that of a Fermi gas at the unitary limit, although, this limit is actually never reached. We also review the properties (energy, effective mass and quasiparticle residue) of a spin-down neutron impurity immersed in a low-density free Fermi gas of spin-up neutrons already studied by the author in a recent work where it was shown that these properties are very close to those of an attractive Fermi polaron in the unitary limit.

In this study we developed a novel vertex finding algorithm for future lepton colliders such as the International Linear Collider. We deploy two networks: one consists of simple fully-connected layers to look for vertex seeds from track pairs, and the other is a customized Recurrent Neural Network with an attention mechanism and an encoder-decoder structure to associate tracks to the vertex seeds. The performance of the vertex finder is compared with the standard ILC vertex reconstruction algorithm.	
 The fraud loss for selecting the model complexity in fraud detection	Simon Boge Brant, Ingrid Hobk Haff	simonbb@math.uio.no		In fraud detection applications, the investigator is typically limited to controlling a restricted number k ùëò k italic_k of cases. The most efficient manner of allocating the resources is then to try selecting the k ùëò k italic_k cases with the highest probability of being fraudulent. The prediction model used for this purpose must normally be regularized to avoid overfitting and consequently bad prediction performance. A new loss function, denoted the fraud loss, is proposed for selecting the model complexity via a tuning parameter. A simulation study is performed to find the optimal settings for validation. Further, the performance of the proposed procedure is compared to the most relevant competing procedure, based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), in a set of simulations, as well as on a VAT fraud dataset. In most cases, choosing the complexity of the model according to the fraud loss, gave a better than, or comparable performance to the AUC in terms of the fraud loss.	
 Banach Manifold Structure and Infinite-Dimensional Analysis for Causal Fermion Systems	Felix Finster, Magdalena LottnerJanuary	None	Fakult√§t f√ºr Mathematik Universit√§t Regensburg D-93040 Regensburg Germany	A mathematical framework is developed for the analysis of causal fermion systems in the infinite-dimensional setting. It is shown that the regular spacetime point operators form a Banach manifold endowed with a canonical Fr√©chet-smooth Riemannian metric. The so-called expedient differential calculus is introduced with the purpose of treating derivatives of functions on Banach spaces which are differentiable only in certain directions. A chain rule is proven for H√∂lder continuous functions which are differentiable on expedient subspaces. These results are made applicable to causal fermion systems by proving that the causal Lagrangian is H√∂lder continuous. Moreover, H√∂lder continuity is analyzed for the integrated causal Lagrangian.

 The Role of Syntactic Planning in Compositional Image Captioning	Emanuele Bugliarello, Desmond ElliottDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of Copenhagen	None	None	Image captioning has focused on generalizing to images drawn from the same distribution as the training set, and not to the more challenging problem of generalizing to different distributions of images. Recently, Nikolaus et al. ( 2019 ) introduced a dataset to assess compositional generalization in image captioning, where models are evaluated on their ability to describe images with unseen adjective‚Äìnoun and noun‚Äìverb compositions. In this work, we investigate different methods to improve compositional generalization by planning the syntactic structure of a caption. Our experiments show that jointly modeling tokens and syntactic tags enhances generalization in both RNN- and Transformer-based models, while also improving performance on standard metrics.

 The Extraordinary Outburst in the Massive Protostellar System NGC 6334 I-MM1: Spatio-kinematics of Water Masers during a Contemporaneous Flare Event	James Chibueze, Gordon MacLeod, Jakobus Vorster, Tomoya Hirota, Crystal Brogan, Todd Hunter, Ruby van Rooyen	None	None	Following an eruptive accretion event in NGC 6334I-MM1, flares in the various maser species, including water masers, were triggered. We report the observed relative proper motion of the highly variable water masers associated with the massive star-forming region, NGC 6334I. High velocity H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O maser proper motions were detected in 5 maser clusters, CM2-W2 (bow-shock structure), MM1-W1, MM1-W3, UCHII-W1 and UCHII-W3. The overall average of the derived relative proper motion is 85 km s ‚àí 1 1 {}^{-1} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT . This mean proper motion is in agreement with the previous results from VLA multi-epoch observations. Our position and velocity variance and co-variance matrix analyses of the maser proper motions show its major axis to have a position angle of ‚àí 79.4 ‚àò superscript 79.4 -79.4^{\circ} - 79.4 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àò end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , cutting through the dust cavity around MM1B and aligned in the northwest-southeast direction. We interpret this as the axis of the jet driving the CM2 shock and the maser motion. The complicated proper motions in MM1-W1 can be explained by the combined influence of the MM1 northeast-southwest bipolar outflow, CS(6-5) north-south collimated bipolar outflow, and the radio jet. The relative proper motions of the H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O masers in UCHII-W1 are likely not driven by the jets of MM1B protostar but by MM3-UCHII. Overall, the post-accretion burst relative proper motions of the H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O masers trace shocks of jet motion.	
 Aharonov-Bohm effect with an effective complex-valued vector potential	Paiva, Aharonov, Tollaksen, Waegell	None	None	The interaction between a quantum charge and a quantized source of a magnetic field is considered in the Aharonov-Bohm scenario. It is shown that, if the source has a relatively small uncertainty while the particle encircles it, an effective magnetic vector potential arises and the final state of the joint system is approximately a tensor product. Furthermore, if a post-selection of the source is considered, the effective vector potential is, in general, complex-valued. This leads to a new prediction in the Aharonov-Bohm scenario before the magnetic field is fully enclosed that has a parallel with Berry phases in open quantum systems. Also, new insights into the correspondence principle, which makes complex vector potentials relevant in the study of classical systems, are discussed.	
 Detecting Malicious Accounts showing Adversarial Behavior in Permissionless Blockchains	, , 	None	None	Different types of malicious activities have been flagged in multiple permissionless blockchains such as bitcoin, Ethereum etc. While some malicious activities exploit vulnerabilities in the infrastructure of the blockchain, some target its users through social engineering techniques. To address these problems, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts that originate such malicious exploitation of accounts of other participants. To that end, we identify a robust supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm that is resistant to any bias induced by an over representation of certain malicious activity in the available dataset, as well as is robust against adversarial attacks. We find that most of the malicious activities reported thus far, for example, in Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, behaves statistically similar. Further, the previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts show bias towards a particular malicious activity which is over-represented. In the sequel, we identify that Neural Networks (NN) holds up the best in the face of such bias inducing dataset at the same time being robust against certain adversarial attacks.	
 Perceptions of Diversity in Electronic Music: the Impact of Listener, Artist, and Track Characteristics	Lorenzo Porcaro, Emilia Gmez, Carlos Castillo	lorenzo.porcaro@upf.edu	None	Shared practices to assess the diversity of retrieval system results are still debated in the Information Retrieval community, partly because of the challenges of determining what diversity means in specific scenarios, and of understanding how diversity is perceived by end-users. The field of Music Information Retrieval is not exempt from this issue. Even if fields such as Musicology or Sociology of Music have a long tradition in questioning the representation and the impact of diversity in cultural environments, such knowledge has not been yet embedded into the design and development of music technologies. In this paper, focusing on electronic music, we investigate the characteristics of listeners, artists, and tracks that are influential in the perception of diversity. Specifically, we center our attention on 1) understanding the relationship between perceived diversity and computational methods to measure diversity, and 2) analyzing how listeners‚Äô domain knowledge and familiarity influence such perceived diversity. To accomplish this, we design a user-study wherein listeners are asked to compare pairs of lists of tracks and artists, and to select the most diverse list from each pair. We compare participants‚Äô ratings with results obtained through computational models built using audio tracks‚Äô features and artist attributes. We find that such models are generally aligned with participants‚Äô choices when most of them agree that one list is more diverse than the other. In addition, we observe how differences in domain knowledge, familiarity, and demographics influence the level of agreement among listeners, and between listeners and computational diversity metrics.

In total, SO will field over 60,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in six spectral bands centered between 27 and 280 GHz in order to achieve the sensitivity necessary to measure or constrain numerous cosmological quantities. In this work, we focus on the SATs which are optimized to search for primordial gravitational waves that are detected as parity-odd polarization patterns called a B-modes on degree scales in the CMB. Each SAT employs a single optics tube with TES arrays operating at 100 mK. The high throughput optics system has a 42 cm aperture and a 35-degree field of view coupled to a 36 cm diameter focal plane. The optics consist of three metamaterial anti-reflection coated silicon lenses. Cryogenic ring baffles with engineered blackbody absorbers are installed in the optics tube to minimize the stray light. The entire optics tube is cooled to 1 K. A cryogenic continuously rotating half-wave plate near the sky side of the aperture stop helps to minimize the effect of atmospheric fluctuations. The telescope warm baffling consists of a forebaffle, an elevation stage mounted co-moving shield, and a fixed ground shield that together control the far side-lobes and mitigates ground-synchronous systematics. We present the status of the SAT development.	
 Spatially indirect excitons in black and blue phosphorene double layers	Michele Re Fiorentin, Giancarlo Cicero, Maurizia Palummo	michele.refiorentin@iit.it	None	Monolayer black and blue phosphorenes possess electronic and optical properties that result in unique features when the two materials are stacked. We devise a low-strain van-der-Waals double layer and investigate its properties with ab initio many-body perturbation theory techniques. A type-II band alignment and optical absorption in the visible range are found. The study demonstrates that spatially indirect excitons with full charge separation can be obtained between two layers with the same elemental composition but different crystalline structure, proving the system interesting for further studies where dipolar excitons are important and for future opto-electronic applications.	
 High-dimensional quantum Fourier transform of twisted light	Jaroslav Kysela	None	None	The Fourier transform proves indispensable in the processing of classical information as well as in the quantum domain, where it finds many applications ranging from state reconstruction to prime factorization. An implementation scheme of the d ùëë d italic_d -dimensional Fourier transform acting on single photons is known that uses the path encoding and requires O ( d log ‚Å° d ) ùëÇ ùëë ùëë O(d\log d) italic_O ( italic_d roman_log italic_d ) optical elements. In this paper we present an alternative design that uses the orbital angular momentum as a carrier of information and needs only O ( d log ‚Å° d ) ùëÇ ùëë ùëë O(\sqrt{d}\log d) italic_O ( square-root start_ARG italic_d end_ARG roman_log italic_d ) elements, rendering the path-encoded design inefficient. The advantageous scaling and the fact that our approach uses only conventional optical elements allows for the implementation of a 256-dimensional Fourier transform with the existing technology. Improvements of our design, as well as explicit setups for low dimensions, are also presented.

Besides Schr√∂dinger Newton equation, we have also concerned with linear and nonlinear Airy beam accelerations in flat and curved spaces and fractal photonics, related to nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation, where impact of the fractional Laplacian is discussed. Another important feature of the gravitational optics‚Äô implementation is its geometry with the paraxial approximation, when quantum mechanics, in particular, fractional quantum mechanics, is an effective description of optical effects. In this case, fractional-time differentiation reflexes this geometry effect as well.

 Energy-mass equivalence from Maxwell equations	Alejandro Perez, Salvatore Ribisi	perez@cpt.univ-mrs.fr	None	Since the appearance of Einstein‚Äôs paper ‚ÄúOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies‚Äù and the birth of special relativity, it is understood that the theory was basically coded within Maxwell‚Äôs equations. The celebrated mass-energy equivalence relation, E = m c 2 ùê∏ ùëö superscript ùëê 2 E=mc^{2} italic_E = italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , is derived by Einstein using thought experiments involving the kinematics of the emission of light (electromagnetic energy) and the relativity principle. Text book derivations often follow paths similar to Einstein‚Äôs, or the analysis of the kinematics of particle collisions interpreted from the perspective of different inertial frames. All the same, in such derivations the direct dynamical link with hypothetical fundamental fields describing matter (e.g. Maxwell theory or other) is overshadowed by the use of powerful symmetry arguments, kinematics, and the relativity principle.	
 Tackling the muon identification in water Cherenkov detectors problem for the future Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory by means of Machine Learning	BS Gonzlez, Conceio, Pimenta, Tom, Guilln	None	"Laborat√≥rio de Instrumenta√ß√£o e F√≠sica Experimental de Part√≠culas (LIP) - Lisbon,
Av. Prof. Gama Pinto 2, 1649-003 Lisbon, Portugal and
Instituto Superior T√©cnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa, Av. Ro"	This paper presents several approaches to deal with the problem of identifying muons in a water Cherenkov detector with a reduced water volume and 4 PMTs. Different perspectives of information representation are used and new features are engineered using the specific domain knowledge. As results show, these new features, in combination with the convolutional layers, are able to achieve a good performance avoiding overfitting and being able to generalise properly for the test set. The results also prove that the combination of state-of-the-art Machine Learning analysis techniques and water Cherenkov detectors with low water depth can be used to efficiently identify muons, which may lead to huge investment savings due to the reduction of the amount of water needed at high altitudes. This achievement can be used in further research to be able to discriminate between gamma and hadron induced showers using muons as discriminant.	
 First-passage time theory of activated rate chemical processes in electronic molecular junctions	Riley Preston, Maxim Gelin, Daniel Kosov	None	None	Confined nanoscale spaces, electric fields and tunneling currents make the molecular electronic junction an experimental device for the discovery of new, out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions. Reaction-rate theory for current-activated chemical reactions is developed by combining a Keldysh nonequilibrium Green‚Äôs functions treatment of electrons, Fokker-Planck description of the reaction coordinate, and Kramers‚Äô first-passage time calculations. The NEGF provide an adiabatic potential as well as a diffusion coefficient and temperature with local dependence on the reaction coordinate. Van Kampen‚Äôs Fokker-Planck equation, which describes a Brownian particle moving in an external potential in an inhomogeneous medium with a position-dependent friction and diffusion coefficient, is used to obtain an analytic expression for the first-passage time. The theory is applied to several transport scenarios: a molecular junction with a single, reaction coordinate dependent molecular orbital, and a model diatomic molecular junction. We demonstrate the natural emergence of Landauer‚Äôs blowtorch effect as a result of the interplay between the configuration dependent viscosity and diffusion coefficients. The resultant localized heating in conjunction with the bond-deformation due to current-induced forces are shown to be the determining factors when considering chemical reaction rates; each of which result from highly tunable parameters within the system.	
 Modified strong-coupling treatment of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg trimerized chain developed from the exactly solved Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain	Taras Verkholyak, Jozef Streka	None	None	Quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimerized chain with strong intradimer and weak monomer-dimer coupling constants is studied using the novel many-body perturbation expansion, which is developed from the exactly solved spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain preserving correlations between all interacting spins of the trimerized chain. It is evidenced that the novel perturbation approach is superior with respect to the standard perturbation scheme developed from a set of noninteracting spin monomers and dimers, whereas its accuracy even coincides up a moderate ratio of the coupling constants with the state-of-the-art numerical techniques. The Heisenberg trimerized chain shows the intermediate one-third plateau, which was also observed in the magnetization curve of the polymeric compound Cu 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT (P 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT OH) 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT affording its experimental realization. Within the modified strong-coupling method we have obtained the effective Hamiltonians for the magnetic-field range from zero to one-third plateau, and from one-third plateau to the saturation magnetization. The unconventional second-order perturbation theory provides extremely accurate results for both critical fields of the intermediate one-third plateau up to the moderate ratio of the coupling constants as convincingly evidenced through a comparison with numerical density-matrix renormalization group data. It is shown that the derived effective Hamiltonian also provides at low enough temperatures sufficiently accurate results for magnetization curves and thermodynamic properties as corroborated through a comparison with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using the results for the effective Hamiltonian we additionally suggest straightforward procedure for finding the microscopic parameters of one-dimensional trimerized magnetic compounds with strong intradimer and weak monomer-dimer couplings. We found the refined values for the coupling constants of Cu 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT (P 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O 6 6 {}_{6} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 6 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT OH) 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT by matching the theoretical results with the available experimental data for the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields.	
 Uniform convergence to equilibrium for a family of drift‚Äìdiffusion models with trap-assisted recombination and self-consistent potential	Klemens Fellner, Michael Kniely	klemens.fellner@uni-graz.at	Institute of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, University of Graz, Heinrichstra√üe 36, 8010 Graz, Austria	We investigate a recombination‚Äìdrift‚Äìdiffusion model coupled to Poisson‚Äôs equation modelling the transport of charge within certain types of semiconductors. In more detail, we study a two-level system for electrons and holes endowed with an intermediate energy level for electrons occupying trapped states. As our main result, we establish an explicit functional inequality between relative entropy and entropy production, which leads to exponential convergence to equilibrium. We stress that our approach is applied uniformly in the lifetime of electrons on the trap level assuming that this lifetime is sufficiently small.

Besides, we give relations among the powers of the matrices associated with 3PGQs. Finally, Lie group and Lie algebra are studied and their matrix representations are shown. Also the Lie multiplication and the killing bilinear form are given.

We show by means of micromagnetic simulation that the fluence of the femtosecond laser pulse and its position with respect to the domain wall affect the frequencies of the excited spin waves, and the presence of the domain wall plays crucial role in control of the spin waves‚Äô spectrum. The predicted effects are understood by analyzing the changes of the spin waves‚Äô dispersion under the impact of the laser pulse.

 Inversion of statistics and thermalization in the Unruh effect	Julio Arrechea, Carlos Barcel, Luis Garay, Gerardo GarcaMoreno	arrechea@iaa.es	None	We derive a master equation for the reduced density matrix of a uniformly accelerating quantum detector in arbitrary dimensions, generically coupled to a field initially in its vacuum state, and analyze its late time regime. We find that such density matrix asymptotically reaches a Gibbs state. The particularities of its evolution towards this state are encoded in the response function, which depends on the dimension, the properties of the fields, and the specific coupling to them. We also compare this situation with the thermalization of a static detector immersed in a thermal field state, pinpointing the differences between both scenarios. In particular, we analyze the role of the response function and its effect on the evolution of the detector towards equilibrium. Furthermore, we explore the consequences of the well-known statistics inversion of the response function of an Unruh-DeWitt detector linearly coupled to a free scalar field in odd spacetime dimensions. This allows us to specify in which sense accelerated detectors in Minkowski vacuum behave as static detectors in a thermal bath and in which sense they do not.	
 An Upper Bound on the Complexity of Tablut	Andrea Galassi	None	None	Tablut is a complete-knowledge, deterministic, and asymmetric board game, which has not been solved nor properly studied yet. In this work, its rules and characteristics are presented, then a study on its complexity is reported. An upper bound to its complexity is found eventually by dividing the state-space of the game into subspaces according to specific conditions. This upper bound is comparable to the one found for Draughts, therefore, it would seem that the open challenge of solving this game requires a considerable computational effort.

 Photonic heat rectification in a coupled qubits system	AIorio, EStrambini, GHaack, MCampisi, FGiazotto	andrea.iorio@sns.it	None	We theoretically investigate a quantum heat diode based on two interacting flux qubits coupled to two heat baths. Rectification of heat currents is achieved by asymmetrically coupling the qubits to the reservoirs modelled as dissipative R L C ùëÖ ùêø ùê∂ RLC italic_R italic_L italic_C resonators. We find that the coherent interaction between the qubits can be exploited to enhance the rectification factor, which otherwise would be constrained by the baths temperatures and couplings. Remarkably high values of rectification ratio up to ‚Ñõ ‚àº 3.5 similar-to ‚Ñõ 3.5 \mathcal{R}\sim 3.5 caligraphic_R ‚àº 3.5 can be obtained for realistic system parameters, with an enhancement up to ‚àº 230 % similar-to absent percent 230 \sim 230\% ‚àº 230 % compared to the non-interacting case. The system features the possibility of manipulating both the rectification amplitude and direction, allowing for an enhancement or suppression of the heat flow to a chosen bath. For the regime of parameters in which rectification is maximized, we find a significant increase of the rectification above a critical interaction value which corresponds to the onset of a non vanishing entanglement in the system. Finally, we discuss the dependence of the rectification factor on the bath temperatures and couplings.

 A Bayesian approach for estimation of weight matrices in spatial autoregressive modelsThis working paper is an earlier draft of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Spatial Economic Analysis on 22nd July 2022, available at: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17421772.2022.2095426.	Tams KrisztinInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis IIASAandPhilipp PiribauerAustrian Institute of Economic Research WIFO	None	None	We develop a Bayesian approach to estimate weight matrices in spatial autoregressive (or spatial lag) models. Datasets in regional economic literature are typically characterized by a limited number of time periods T ùëá T italic_T relative to spatial units N ùëÅ N italic_N . When the spatial weight matrix is subject to estimation severe problems of over-parametrization are likely. To make estimation feasible, our approach focusses on spatial weight matrices which are binary prior to row-standardization. We discuss the use of hierarchical priors which impose sparsity in the spatial weight matrix. Monte Carlo simulations show that these priors perform very well where the number of unknown parameters is large relative to the observations. The virtues of our approach are demonstrated using global data from the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.	
 Exploring Cross-Image Pixel Contrast for Semantic Segmentation	Wenguan WangthanksThe first two authors contribute equally to this workstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tianfei ZhoustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Fisher YustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jifeng DaistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ender KonukoglustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Luc Van GoolstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTComputer Vision Lab, ETH ZurichstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSenseTime Research	None	None	Current semantic segmentation methods focus only on mining ‚Äúlocal‚Äù context, \ie , dependencies between pixels within individual images, by context-aggregation modules ( \eg , dilated convolution, neural attention) or structure-aware optimization criteria ( \eg , IoU-like loss). However, they ignore ‚Äúglobal‚Äù context of the training data, \ie , rich semantic relations between pixels across different images. Inspired by recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive algorithm for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing. We experimentally show that, with famous segmentation models ( \ie , DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCR) and backbones ( \ie , ResNet, HRNet), our method brings performance improvements across diverse datasets ( \ie , Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff, CamVid). We expect this work will encourage our community to rethink the current de facto training paradigm in semantic segmentation. 1 1 1 Our code will be available at https://github.com/tfzhou/ContrastiveSeg .

 Coexistence of intrinsic piezoelectricity and nontrivial band topology in monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te)	SanDong GuostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, WenQi MustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, YuTong ZhustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, ShaoQing WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand GuangZhao WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The combination of piezoelectricity with other unique properties (like topological insulating phase and intrinsic ferromagnetism) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is much worthy of intensive study. In this work, the piezoelectric properties of 2D topological insulators InXO (X=Se and Te) from monolayer InX (X=Se and Te) with double-side oxygen functionalization are studied by density functional theory (DFT). The large piezoelectric strain coefficients (e.g. d 11 subscript ùëë 11 d_{11} italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =-13.02 pm/V for InSeO and d 11 subscript ùëë 11 d_{11} italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =-9.64 pm/V for InTeO) are predicted, which are comparable and even higher than ones of many other familiar 2D materials. Moreover, we propose two strategies to enhance piezoelectric response of monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te). Firstly, the biaxial strain (0.94-1.06) is applied, and the d 11 subscript ùëë 11 d_{11} italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (absolute value) is increased by 53%/56% for monolayer InSeO/InTeO at 1.06 strain, which is due to increased e 11 subscript ùëí 11 e_{11} italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (absolute value) and reduced C 11 ‚àí C 12 subscript ùê∂ 11 subscript ùê∂ 12 C_{11}-C_{12} italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_C start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . In considered strain range, InXO (X=Se and Te) monolayers are always 2D topological insulators, which confirm the coexistence of piezoelectricity and nontrivial band topology. Secondly, a Janus monolayer In 2 SeTeO 2 subscript In 2 subscript SeTeO 2 \mathrm{In_{2}SeTeO_{2}} roman_In start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SeTeO start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is designed by replacing the top Se/Te atomic layer in monolayer InSeO/InTeO with Te/Se atoms, which is dynamically and mechanically stable. More excitingly, Janus monolayer In 2 SeTeO 2 subscript In 2 subscript SeTeO 2 \mathrm{In_{2}SeTeO_{2}} roman_In start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SeTeO start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is also a 2D topological insulator with sizeable bulk gap up to 0.158 eV, confirming the coexistence of intrinsic piezoelectricity and topological nature. The calculated d 11 subscript ùëë 11 d_{11} italic_d start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is -9.9 pm/V, which is in the middle of ones of InSeO and InTeO monolayers. Finally, the carrier mobilities of monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te) are obtained, which shows a rather pronounced anisotropy between electron and hole, and are almost isotropic between armchair and zigzag directions. Our works imply that it is possible to use the piezotronic effect to control the quantum transport process, ultimately leading to novel device applications in monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te), and can stimulate further experimental works.	
 An Explainable AI System for Automated COVID-19 Assessment and Lesion Categorization from CT-scans	Matteo Pennisi, Isaak Kavasidis, Concetto Spampinato, Vincenzo Schinin, Simone Palazzo, Francesco Rundo, Massimo Cristofaro, Paolo Campioni, Elisa Pianura, Federica Di Stefano, Ada Petrone, Fabrizio Albarello, Giuseppe Ippolito, Salvatore Cuzzocrea, Sabrina Conoci	None	None	COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is a catastrophic pandemic outbreak all over the world with exponential increasing of confirmed cases and, unfortunately, deaths. In this work we propose an AI-powered pipeline, based on the deep-learning paradigm, for automated COVID-19 detection and lesion categorization from CT scans. We first propose a new segmentation module aimed at identifying automatically lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combined such segmentation network with classification networks for COVID-19 identification and lesion categorization. We compare the obtained classification results with those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset consisting of 162 CT scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 93.5% for COVID-19 detection, outperforming those yielded by the expert radiologists, and an average lesion categorization accuracy of over 84%. Results also show that a significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation that allowed us to enhance performance by over 20 percent points. The interpretation of the trained AI models, moreover, reveals that the most significant areas for supporting the decision on COVID-19 identification are consistent with the lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy paving, consolidation and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to discriminate a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients with interstitial pneumonia tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the AI models are integrated into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists, which is publicly available at http://perceivelab.com/covid-ai . The whole AI system is unique since, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first AI-based software, publicly available, that attempts to explain to radiologists what information is used by AI methods for making decision and that involves proactively them in the decision loop to further improve the COVID-19 understanding.

Dividing the galaxies by their present-day stellar mass, we demonstrate the downsizing phenomenon, whereby the more massive galaxies hosted the most star-formation at earlier times. Further dividing the galaxy sample by colour and morphology, we find that a galaxy‚Äôs present-day colour tell us more about its historical contribution to the cosmic star formation history than its current morphology. We show that downsizing effects are greatest among galaxies currently in the blue cloud, but that the level of downsizing in galaxies of different morphologies depends quite sensitively on the morphological classification used, due largely to the difficulty in classifying the smaller low-mass galaxies from their ground-based images. Nevertheless, we find agreement that among galaxies with stellar masses M ‚ãÜ > 6 √ó 10 9 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ ‚ãÜ 6 superscript 10 9 subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\star}>6\times 10^{9}\,M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚ãÜ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT > 6 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , downsizing is most significant in spirals. However, there are complicating factors. For example, for more massive galaxies, we find that colour and morphology are predictors of the past star formation over a longer timescale than in less massive systems. Presumably this effect is reflecting the longer period of evolution required to alter these larger galaxies‚Äô physical properties, but shows that conclusions based on any single property don‚Äôt tell the full story.	
 Equilibrium Learning in Combinatorial Auctions: Computing Approximate Bayesian Nash Equilibria via Pseudogradient Dynamics	Stefan Heidekrger, Paul Sutterer, Nils Kohring, Maximilian Fichtl, Martin Bichler	stefan.heidekrueger@in.tum.de	None	Applications of combinatorial auctions (CA) as market mechanisms are prevalent in practice, yet their Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNE) remain poorly understood. Analytical solutions are known only for a few cases where the problem can be reformulated as a tractable partial differential equation (PDE). In the general case, finding BNE is known to be computationally hard. Previous work on numerical computation of BNE in auctions has relied either on solving such PDEs explicitly, calculating pointwise best-responses in strategy space, or iteratively solving restricted subgames. In this study, we present a generic yet scalable alternative multi-agent equilibrium learning method that represents strategies as neural networks and applies policy iteration based on gradient dynamics in self-play. Most auctions are ex-post nondifferentiable, so gradients may be unavailable or misleading, and we rely on suitable pseudogradient estimates instead. Although it is well-known that gradient dynamics cannot guarantee convergence to NE in general, we observe fast and robust convergence to approximate BNE in a wide variety of auctions and present a sufficient condition for convergence.

In this paper, we propose a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance as a fundamental approach to solve the problem. Specifically, the rotated bounding box is converted to a 2-D Gaussian distribution, which enables to approximate the indifferentiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) which can be learned efficiently by gradient back-propagation. GWD can still be informative for learning even there is no overlapping between two rotating bounding boxes which is often the case for small object detection. Thanks to its three unique properties, GWD can also elegantly solve the boundary discontinuity and square-like problem regardless how the bounding box is defined. Experiments on five datasets using different detectors show the effectiveness of our approach.

Social media users can easily share information with the rest of the world. This may sometimes encourage spread of fake news, which can result in undesirable consequences. In this work, we train models which can identify health news related to COVID-19 pandemic as real or fake. Our models achieve a high F1-score of 98.64%. Our models achieve second place on the leaderboard, tailing the first position with a very narrow margin 0.05% points.

 Us vs. Them: A Dataset of Populist Attitudes, News Bias and Emotions	PereLlus Huguet Cabot,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, David AbadistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTInstitute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of AmsterdamstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDepartment of Psychology, University of AmsterdamstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTBabelscape Srl, Sapienza University of Rome	None	None	Computational modelling of political discourse tasks has become an increasingly important area of research in natural language processing. Populist rhetoric has risen across the political sphere in recent years; however, computational approaches to it have been scarce due to its complex nature. In this paper, we present the new Us vs. Them dataset, consisting of 6861 Reddit comments annotated for populist attitudes and the first large-scale computational models of this phenomenon. We investigate the relationship between populist mindsets and social groups, as well as a range of emotions typically associated with these. We set a baseline for two tasks related to populist attitudes and present a set of multi-task learning models that leverage and demonstrate the importance of emotion and group identification as auxiliary tasks.	
 Multi-Antenna Joint Radar and Communications: Precoder Optimization and Weighted Sum-Rate vs Probing Power Tradeoff	CHENGCHENG XU, BRUNO CLERCKX,, AND JIANYUN ZHANG	None	College of Electronic Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Hefei 230037, China	In order to further exploit the potential of joint multi-antenna radar-communication (RadCom) system, we propose two transmission techniques respectively based on separated and shared antenna deployments. Both techniques are designed to maximize weighted sum rate (WSR) and probing power at target‚Äôs location under average power constraints at antennas such that the system can simultaneously communicate with downlink users and detect the target within the same frequency band. Based on a Weighted Minimized Mean Square Errors (WMMSE) method, the separated deployment transmission is designed via semidefinite programming (SDP) while the shared deployment problem is solved by majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. Numerical results show that shared deployment outperforms separated deployment in radar beamforming. The tradeoffs between WSR and probing power at target are compared among both proposed transmissions and two practically simpler dual-function implementations i.e., time division and frequency division. Results show that although separated deployment has an advantage of realizing spectrum sharing, it experiences a performance loss compared with frequency division, while shared deployment outperforms both and surpasses time division in certain conditions.	
 Attention Guided Dialogue State Tracking with Sparse Supervision	Shuailong Liang, Lahari Poddar, Gyuri SzarvasSingapore University of Technology and Design,Amazon Development Center Germany GmbHliangshuailonggmailcom poddarl,szarvasgamazoncom	None	None	Existing approaches to Dialogue State Tracking (DST) rely on turn level dialogue state annotations, which are expensive to acquire in large scale. In call centers, for tasks like managing bookings or subscriptions, the user goal can be associated with actions (e.g. API calls) issued by customer service agents. These action logs are available in large volumes and can be utilized for learning dialogue states. However, unlike turn-level annotations, such logged actions are only available sparsely across the dialogue, providing only a form of weak supervision for DST models.	
 Syntactic Nuclei in Dependency Parsing ‚Äì A Multilingual Exploration	Ali BasiratUppsala UniversityDeptof Linguistics and PhilologyJoakim NivreUppsala UniversityDeptof Linguistics and Philology	None	None	Standard models for syntactic dependency parsing take words to be the elementary units that enter into dependency relations. In this paper, we investigate whether there are any benefits from enriching these models with the more abstract notion of nucleus proposed by Tesni√®re. We do this by showing how the concept of nucleus can be defined in the framework of Universal Dependencies and how we can use composition functions to make a transition-based dependency parser aware of this concept. Experiments on 12 languages show that nucleus composition gives small but significant improvements in parsing accuracy. Further analysis reveals that the improvement mainly concerns a small number of dependency relations, including nominal modifiers, relations of coordination, main predicates, and direct objects.

 On the computation of recurrence coefficients for univariate orthogonal polynomials	Zexin Liu, Akil Narayan	None	Department of Mathematics, and Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, the University of Utah	Associated to a finite measure on the real line with finite moments are recurrence coefficients in a three-term formula for orthogonal polynomials with respect to this measure. These recurrence coefficients are frequently inputs to modern computational tools that facilitate evaluation and manipulation of polynomials with respect to the measure, and such tasks are foundational in numerical approximation and quadrature. Although the recurrence coefficients for classical measures are known explicitly, those for nonclassical measures must typically be numerically computed. We survey and review existing approaches for computing these recurrence coefficients for univariate orthogonal polynomial families and propose a novel ‚Äúpredictor-corrector‚Äù algorithm for a general class of continuous measures. We combine the predictor-corrector scheme with a stabilized Lanczos procedure for a new hybrid algorithm that computes recurrence coefficients for a fairly wide class of measures that can have both continuous and discrete parts. We evaluate the new algorithms against existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.	
 New Developments in Relativistic Fluid Dynamics with spin	Samapan Bhadury, Jitesh Bhatt, Amaresh Jaiswal, Avdhesh Kumar	samapan.bhadury@niser.ac.in	None	In this work, we briefly review the progress made in the formulation of hydrodynamics with spin with emphasis on the application to the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In particular, we discuss the formulation of hydrodynamics with spin for perfect-fluid and the first order viscous corrections with some discussion on the calculation of spin kinetic coefficients. Finally, we apply relativistic hydrodynamics with spin to the relativistic heavy-ion collisions to calculate the spin polarization of Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ -particles.	
 Choice functions on posets	Danilov	None	None	In the paper we study choice functions on posets satisfying the conditions of heredity and outcast. For every well-ordered sequence of elements of a poset, we define the corresponding ‚Äòelementary‚Äô choice function. Every such a choice function satisfies the conditions of heredity and outcast. Inversely, every choice function satisfying the conditions of heredity and outcast can be represented as a union of several elementary choice functions. This result generalizes the Aizerman-Malishevski theorem about the structure of path-independent choice functions.	
 Cubic-scaling all-electron ùê∫‚Å¢ùëä calculations with a separable density-fitting space-time approach	Ivan Duchemin, Xavier Blase	ivan.duchemin@cea.fr	None	We present an implementation of the G W ùê∫ ùëä GW italic_G italic_W space-time approach that allows cubic-scaling all-electron calculations with standard Gaussian basis sets without exploiting any localization nor sparsity considerations. The independent-electron susceptibility is constructed in a time representation over a non-uniform distribution of real-space locations { ùê´ k } subscript ùê´ ùëò \{{\bf r}_{k}\} { bold_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } optimized within a separable resolution-of-the-identity framework to reproduce standard Coulomb-fitting calculations with meV accuracy. The compactness of the obtained { ùê´ k } subscript ùê´ ùëò \{{\bf r}_{k}\} { bold_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } distribution leads to a crossover with the standard Coulomb-fitting scheme for system sizes below a few hundred electrons. The needed analytic continuation follows a recent approach that requires the continuation of the screened Coulomb potential rather than the much more structured self-energy. The present scheme is benchmarked over large molecular sets and scaling properties are demonstrated on a family of defected hexagonal boron-nitride flakes containing up to 6000 electrons.	
 Exploring the Impact of Tunable Agents in Sequential Social Dilemmas	David OCallaghan, Patrick Mannion	ocallaghan1@gmail.com	None	When developing reinforcement learning agents, the standard approach is to train an agent to converge to a fixed policy that is as close to optimal as possible for a single fixed reward function. If different agent behaviour is required in the future, an agent trained in this way must normally be either fully or partially retrained, wasting valuable time and resources. In this study, we leverage multi-objective reinforcement learning to create tunable agents, i.e. agents that can adopt a range of different behaviours according to the designer‚Äôs preferences, without the need for retraining. We apply this technique to sequential social dilemmas, settings where there is inherent tension between individual and collective rationality. Learning a single fixed policy in such settings leaves one at a significant disadvantage if the opponents‚Äô strategies change after learning is complete. In our work, we demonstrate empirically that the tunable agents framework allows easy adaption between cooperative and competitive behaviours in sequential social dilemmas without the need for retraining, allowing a single trained agent model to be adjusted to cater for a wide range of behaviours and opponent strategies.	
 Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, polynomials and the classical moment problem	Holger DetteRuhrUniversitt Bochum,Fakultt fr Mathematik, Bochum, Germany, Anatoly ZhigljavskySchool of Mathematics,Cardiff University,Cardiff, CF AG, UK	None	None	We show that polynomials do not belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of infinitely differentiable translation-invariant kernels whose spectral measures have moments corresponding to a determinate moment problem. Our proof is based on relating this question to the problem of the best linear estimation in continuous time one-parameter regression models with a stationary error process defined by the kernel. In particular, we show that the existence of a sequence of estimators with variances converging to 0 0 implies that the regression function cannot be an element of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This question is then related to the determinacy of the Hamburger moment problem for the spectral measure corresponding to the kernel.	
 Magnetic Field Effects on the Transport Properties of High-Tc Cuprates	MarinostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Arouca,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Starting from a recently proposed comprehensive theory for the high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, we derive a general analytic expression for the planar resistivity, in the presence of an applied external magnetic field H and explore its consequences in the different phases of these materials. As an initial probe of our result, we show it compares very well with experimental data for the resistivity of LSCO at different values of the applied field. We also apply our result to Bi2201 and show that the magnetoresistivity in the strange metal phase of this material, exhibits the H 2 superscript ùêª 2 H^{2} italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to H ùêª H italic_H crossover, as we move from the weak to the strong field regime.

We show that this provides a simple method to determine whether the quantum critical point associated to the pseudogap temperature T * ( x ) superscript ùëá ùë• T^{*}(x) italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_x ) belongs to the SC dome or not.	
 AHMoSe: A Knowledge-Based Visual Support System for Selecting Regression Machine Learning Models	Diego Rojo, Nyi Nyi Htun, Denis Parra, Robin De Croon, Katrien Verbert	diego.rojogarcia@kuleuven.be	Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium	Decision support systems have become increasingly popular in the domain of agriculture. With the development of automated machine learning, agricultural experts are now able to train, evaluate and make predictions using cutting edge machine learning (ML) models without the need for much ML knowledge. Although this automated approach has led to successful results in many scenarios, in certain cases (e.g., when few labeled datasets are available) choosing among different models with similar performance metrics is a difficult task. Furthermore, these systems do not commonly allow users to incorporate their domain knowledge that could facilitate the task of model selection, and to gain insight into the prediction system for eventual decision making. To address these issues, in this paper we present AHMoSe, a visual support system that allows domain experts to better understand, diagnose and compare different regression models, primarily by enriching model-agnostic explanations with domain knowledge. To validate AHMoSe, we describe a use case scenario in the viticulture domain, grape quality prediction, where the system enables users to diagnose and select prediction models that perform better. We also discuss feedback concerning the design of the tool from both ML and viticulture experts.

 PSpan: Mining Frequent Subnets of Petri Netsfootnote footnote	Ruqian Lu, Shuhan Zhang	rqlu@math.ac.cn	Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science Key Lab of MADIS Chineses Academy Science	This paper proposes for the first time an algorithm PSpan for mining frequent complete subnets from a set of Petri nets. We introduced the concept of complete subnets and the net graph representation. PSpan transforms Petri nets in net graphs and performs sub-net graph mining on them, then transforms the results back to frequent subnets. PSpan follows the pattern growth approach and has similar complexity like gSpan in graph mining. Experiments have been done to confirm PSpan‚Äôs reliability and complexity. Besides C/E nets, it applies also to a set of other Petri net subclasses.

 Disembodied Machine Learning: On the Illusion of Objectivity in NLP	Zeerak Waseem, Smarika Lulz, Joachim Bingel, Isabelle Augenstein	None	None	Machine Learning seeks to identify and encode bodies of knowledge within provided datasets. However, data encodes subjective content, which determines the possible outcomes of the models trained on it. Because such subjectivity enables marginalisation of parts of society, it is termed (social) ‚Äòbias‚Äô and sought to be removed. In this paper, we contextualise this discourse of bias in the ML community against the subjective choices in the development process. Through a consideration of how choices in data and model development construct subjectivity, or biases that are represented in a model, we argue that addressing and mitigating biases is near-impossible. This is because both data and ML models are objects for which meaning is made in each step of the development pipeline, from data selection over annotation to model training and analysis. Accordingly, we find the prevalent discourse of bias limiting in its ability to address social marginalisation. We recommend to be conscientious of this, and to accept that de-biasing methods only correct for a fraction of biases.

Elena Zotova, Rodrigo Agerri, German Rigau	ezotova@vicomtech.org	SNLT group at Vicomtech Foundation, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA)	Popular social media networks provide the perfect environment to study the opinions and attitudes expressed by users. While interactions in social media such as Twitter occur in many natural languages, research on stance detection (the position or attitude expressed with respect to a specific topic) within the Natural Language Processing field has largely been done for English. Although some efforts have recently been made to develop annotated data in other languages, there is a telling lack of resources to facilitate multilingual and crosslingual research on stance detection. This is partially due to the fact that manually annotating a corpus of social media texts is a difficult, slow and costly process. Furthermore, as stance is a highly domain- and topic-specific phenomenon, the need for annotated data is specially demanding. As a result, most of the manually labeled resources are hindered by their relatively small size and skewed class distribution. This paper presents a method to obtain multilingual datasets for stance detection in Twitter. Instead of manually annotating on a per tweet basis, we leverage user-based information to semi-automatically label large amounts of tweets. Empirical monolingual and cross-lingual experimentation and qualitative analysis show that our method helps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties to build large, balanced and multilingual labeled corpora. We believe that our method can be easily adapted to easily generate labeled social media data for other Natural Language Processing tasks and domains.	
 Virtual levels and virtual states of linear operators in Banach spaces.

 Embedding Symbolic Temporal Knowledge into Deep Sequential Models	Yaqi XiestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Fan ZhoustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Harold SohDept of Computer Science, National University of Singapore	None	None	Sequences and time-series often arise in robot tasks, e.g., in activity recognition and imitation learning. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as an effective data-driven methodology for processing sequences given sufficient training data and compute resources. However, when data is limited, simpler models such as logic/rule-based methods work surprisingly well, especially when relevant prior knowledge is applied in their construction. However, unlike DNNs, these ‚Äústructured‚Äù models can be difficult to extend, and do not work well with raw unstructured data. In this work, we seek to learn flexible DNNs, yet leverage prior temporal knowledge when available. Our approach is to embed symbolic knowledge expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) and use these embeddings to guide the training of deep models. Specifically, we construct semantic-based embeddings of automata generated from LTL formula via a Graph Neural Network. Experiments show that these learnt embeddings can lead to improvements on downstream robot tasks such as sequential action recognition and imitation learning.

 Electrical spin-wave spectroscopy in nanoscale waveguides with nonuniform magnetization	Giacomo Talmelli, Daniele Narducci, Frederic Vanderveken, Marc Heyns, Fernanda Irrera, Inge Asselberghs, Iuliana Radu, Christoph Adelmann, Florin Ciubotaru	None	None	Spin waves modes in magnetic waveguides with width down to 320 nm have been studied by electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy and micromagnetic simulations for both longitudinal and transverse magnetic bias fields. For longitudinal bias fields, a 1.3 GHz wide spin-wave band was observed in agreement with analytical dispersion relations for uniform magnetization. However, transverse bias field led to several distinct bands, corresponding to different quantized width modes, with both negative and positive slopes. Micromagnetic simulations showed that, in this geometry, the magnetization was nonuniform and tilted due to the strong shape anisotropy of the waveguides. Simulations of the quantized spin-wave modes in such nonuniformly magnetized waveguides resulted in spin wave dispersion relations in good agreement with the experiments.

 A numerical approach for heat flux estimation in thin slabs continuous casting molds using data assimilation	Umberto Emil Morelli,,, Patricia Barral,, Peregrina Quintela,, Gianluigi Rozza, Giovanni Stabile	umbertoemil.morelli@usc.es	1Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain	In the present work, we consider the industrial problem of estimating in real-time the mold-steel heat flux in continuous casting mold. We approach this problem by first considering the mold modeling problem (direct problem). Then, we plant the heat flux estimation problem as the inverse problem of estimating a Neumann boundary condition having as data pointwise temperature measurements in the interior of the mold domain. We also consider the case of having a total heat flux measurement together with the temperature measurements. We develop two methodologies for solving this inverse problem. The first one is the traditional Alifanov‚Äôs regularization, the second one exploits the parameterization of the heat flux. We develop the latter method to have an offline-online decomposition with a computationally efficient online part to be performed in real-time. In the last part of this work, we test these methods on academic and industrial benchmarks. The results show that the parameterization method outclasses Alifanov‚Äôs regularization both in performance and computational cost. Moreover, it proves to be robust with respect to the measurements noise. Finally, the tests confirm that the computational cost is suitable for real-time estimation of the heat flux.	
 Tokens-to-Token ViT: Training Vision Transformers from Scratch on ImageNet	Li Yuan, Yunpeng Chen, Tao Wang,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Weihao Yu, Yujun Shi,Zihang Jiang, Francis EH Tay, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng YanstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently, e.g . , the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50 (21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3% top1 accuracy in image resolution 384 √ó \times √ó 384 on ImageNet. 1 1 1 Code: https://github.com/yitu-opensource/T2T-ViT	
 PIG-Net: Inception based Deep Learning Architecture for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation	Sindhu, Shankar	sindhu.hegde@research.iiit.ac.in	IIIT Hyderabad, India	Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of surface geometry of 3D objects, have gained increasing popularity with the evolution of deep learning networks for classification and segmentation tasks. Unlike human, teaching the machine to analyze the segments of an object is a challenging task and quite essential in various machine vision applications. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation and labelling of the 3D point clouds by proposing a inception based deep network architecture called PIG-Net, that effectively characterizes the local and global geometric details of the point clouds. In PIG-Net, the local features are extracted from the transformed input points using the proposed inception layers and then aligned by feature transform. These local features are aggregated using the global average pooling layer to obtain the global features. Finally, feed the concatenated local and global features to the convolution layers for segmenting the 3D point clouds. We perform an exhaustive experimental analysis of the PIG-Net architecture on two state-of-the-art datasets, namely, ShapeNet Yi et al. ( 2016 ) and PartNet Mo et al. ( 2019 ) . We evaluate the effectiveness of our network by performing ablation study.

 Aerosol generation in public restrooms	Jesse Schreck, Masoud Jahandar Lashaki, Javad Hashemi, Manhar Dhanak, Siddhartha Verma	jschreck2015@fau.edu	None	Aerosolized droplets play a central role in the transmission of various infectious diseases, including Legionnaire‚Äôs disease, gastroenteritis-causing norovirus, and most recently COVID-19. Respiratory droplets are known to be the most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19, especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets in the size range 0.3 Œº m 0.3 ùúá ùëö 0.3\mu m 0.3 italic_Œº italic_m to 3 Œº m 3 ùúá ùëö 3\mu m 3 italic_Œº italic_m , which can reach heights of at least 1.52 m 1.52 ùëö 1.52m 1.52 italic_m . Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of airborne disease transmission.	
 Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in South Korea	Kwangmin Lee, Seongil Jo, Jaeyong Lee	None	None	In 2020 2020 \displaystyle 2020 2020 , Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported three rounds of surveys on seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in South Korea. We analyze the seroprevalence surveys using a Bayesian method with an informative prior distribution on the seroprevalence parameter, and the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test. We construct the informative prior using the posterior distribution obtained from the clinical evaluation data based on the plaque reduction neutralization test. The constraint of the seroprevalence parameter induced from the known confirmed cornonavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao‚Äôs test can be the empty set, while the Bayesian method renders a reasonable interval estimator.

 Acting in Delayed Environments with Non-Stationary Markov Policies	Esther DermanTechnionGal DalalNvidia ResearchShie MannorNvidia Research Technion	None	None	The standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation hinges on the assumption that an action is executed immediately after it was chosen. However, assuming it is often unrealistic and can lead to catastrophic failures in applications such as robotic manipulation, cloud computing, and finance. We introduce a framework for learning and planning in MDPs where the decision-maker commits actions that are executed with a delay of m ùëö m italic_m steps. The brute-force state augmentation baseline where the state is concatenated to the last m ùëö m italic_m committed actions suffers from an exponential complexity in m ùëö m italic_m , as we show for policy iteration. We then prove that with execution delay, deterministic Markov policies in the original state-space are sufficient for attaining maximal reward, but need to be non-stationary. As for stationary Markov policies, we show they are sub-optimal in general. Consequently, we devise a non-stationary Q-learning style model-based algorithm that solves delayed execution tasks without resorting to state-augmentation. Experiments on tabular, physical, and Atari domains reveal that it converges quickly to high performance even for substantial delays, while standard approaches that either ignore the delay or rely on state-augmentation struggle or fail due to divergence. The code is available at https://github.com/galdl/rl_delay_basic.git .

 Phase Behaviour of Binary Hard-Sphere Mixtures: Free Volume Theory Including Reservoir Hard-Core Interactions	Opdam, Schelling, Tuinier	None	None	Comprehensive calculations were performed to predict the phase behaviour of large spherical colloids mixed with small spherical colloids that act as depletant. To this end, the free volume theory (FVT) of Lekkerkerker et al. [ Europhys. Lett. 20 (1992) 559] is used as a basis and is extended to explicitly include the hard-sphere character of colloidal depletants into the expression for the free volume fraction. Taking the excluded volume of the depletants into account in b o t h ùëè ùëú ùë° ‚Ñé both italic_b italic_o italic_t italic_h the system and the reservoir provides a relation between the depletant concentration in the reservoir and in the system that accurately matches with computer simulation results of Dijkstra et al. [ Phys. Rev. E 59 (1999) 5744]. Moreover, the phase diagrams for highly asymmetric mixtures with size ratios q ‚â≤ 0.2 less-than-or-similar-to ùëû 0.2 q\lesssim 0.2 italic_q ‚â≤ 0.2 obtained by using this new approach corroborates simulation results significantly better than earlier FVT applications to binary hard-sphere mixtures. The phase diagram of a binary hard-sphere mixture with a size ratio of q = 0.4 ùëû 0.4 q=0.4 italic_q = 0.4 , where a binary interstitial solid solution is formed at high densities, is investigated using a numerical free volume approach. At this size ratio, the obtained phase diagram is qualitatively different from previous FVT approaches for hard-sphere and penetrable depletants, but again compares well with simulation predictions.

 Continuous One-Counter Automata	Michael Blondin,Tim LeysFilip Mazowiecki,Philip Offtermatt, andGuillermo Prez	None	None	We study the reachability problem for continuous one-counter automata, COCA for short. In such automata, transitions are guarded by upper and lower bound tests against the counter value. Additionally, the counter updates associated with taking transitions can be (non-deterministically) scaled down by a nonzero factor between zero and one. Our three main results are as follows: (1) We prove that the reachability problem for COCA with global upper and lower bound tests is in NC2; (2) that, in general, the problem is decidable in polynomial time; and (3) that it is decidable in the polynomial hierarchy for COCA with parametric counter updates and bound tests.	
 Polaron Interactions and Bipolarons in One-Dimensional Bose Gases in the Strong Coupling Regime	MWill, Astrakharchik, MFleischhauer	None	None	Bose polarons, quasi-particles composed of mobile impurities surrounded by cold Bose gas, can experience strong interactions mediated by the many-body environment and form bipolaron bound states. Here we present a detailed study of heavy polarons in a one-dimensional Bose gas by formulating a non-perturbative theory and complementing it with exact numerical simulations. We develop an analytic approach for weak boson-boson interactions and arbitrarily strong impurity-boson couplings. Our approach is based on a mean-field theory that accounts for deformations of the superfluid by the impurities and in this way minimizes quantum fluctuations. The mean-field equations are solved exactly in Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation leading to an analytic expression for the interaction potential of heavy polarons which is found to be in excellent agreement with quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) results. In the strong-coupling limit the potential substantially deviates from the exponential form valid for weak coupling and has a linear shape at short distances. Taking into account the leading-order Born-Huang corrections we calculate bipolaron binding energies for impurity-boson mass ratios as low as 3 and find excellent agreement with QMC results.	
 Magneto-acoustic oscillations observed in a solar plage region	Haisheng Ji, Parida Hashim, Zhenxiang Hong, Zhe, Xu, Jinhua, Shen, Kaifan Ji, Wenda, Cao	None	None	We gave an extensive study for the quasi-periodic perturbations on the time profiles of the line of sight (LOS) magnetic field in 10 √ó 10 10 10 10\times 10 10 √ó 10 sub-areas in a solar plage region (corresponds to a facula on the photosphere). The perturbations are found to be associated with enhancement of He I 10830 √Ö absorption in a moss region, which is connected to loops with million-degree plasma. FFT analysis to the perturbations gives a kind of spectrum similar to that of Doppler velocity: a number of discrete periods around 5 minutes. The amplitudes of the magnetic perturbations are found to be proportional to magnetic field strength over these sub-areas. In addition, magnetic perturbations lag behind a quarter of cycle in phase with respect to the p-mode Doppler velocity. We show that the relationships can be well explained with an MHD solution for the magneto-acoustic oscillations in high- Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ plasma. Observational analysis also shows that, for the two regions with the stronger and weaker magnetic field, the perturbations are always anti-phased. All findings show that the magnetic perturbations are actually magneto-acoustic oscillations on the solar surface, the photosphere, powered by p-mode oscillations. The findings may provide a new diagnostic tool for exploring the relationship between magneto-acoustic oscillations and the heating of solar upper atmosphere, as well as their role in helioseismology.

We show that the proposed method ensures efficiency and validity for multi-target regression problems on various data sets.

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/	Kristina Dingel, Rico Huhnstock, Andr Knie, Arno Ehresmann, Bernhard Sick	None	Intelligent Embedded Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kassel, Wilhelmsh√∂her Allee 73, 34121 Kassel, Germany	Due to its rising importance in science and technology in recent years, particle tracking in videos presents itself as a tool for successfully acquiring new knowledge in the field of life sciences and physics. Accordingly, different particle tracking methods for various scenarios have been developed. In this article, we present a particle tracking application implemented in Python for, in particular, spherical magnetic particles, including superparamagnetic beads and Janus particles. In the following, we distinguish between two sub-steps in particle tracking, namely the localization of particles in single images and the linking of the extracted particle positions of the subsequent frames into trajectories. We provide an intensity-based localization technique to detect particles and two linking algorithms, which apply either frame-by-frame linking or linear assignment problem solving. Beyond that, we offer helpful tools to preprocess images automatically as well as estimate parameters required for the localization algorithm by utilizing machine learning. As an extra, we have implemented a technique to estimate the current spatial orientation of Janus particles within the x-y-plane. Our framework is readily extendable and easy-to-use as we offer a graphical user interface and a command-line tool. Various output options, such as data frames and videos, ensure further analysis that can be automated.	
 Phase diagram for strongly interacting matter in the presence of a magnetic field using the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with magnetic field dependent coupling strengths	Joo Moreira, Pedro Costa, Tulio Restrepo	jmoreira@uc.pt	None	We study the phase diagram for strongly interacting matter using the ‚Äôt Hooft determinant extended Nambu‚ÄìJona-Lasinio model with a Polyakov loop in the light and strange quark sectors ( up , down and strange ) focusing on the effect of a magnetic field dependence of the coupling strengths of these interactions. This dependence was obtained so as to reproduce recent lattice QCD results for the magnetic field dependence of the quarks dynamical masses.	
 Multigrid as an exact solver	Adem Kaya	kaya@uni-potsdam.de	"Institut f√ºr Mathematik, Universit√§t Potsdam
Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25
14476 Potsdam/Golm
Germany"	We provide an alternative Fourier analysis for multigrid applied to the Poisson problem in 1D, based on explicit derivation of spectra of the iteration matrix. The new Fourier analysis has advantages over the existing one. It is easy to understand and enables us to write the error equation in terms of the eigenvector of the stiffness matrix. When weighted-Jacobi is used as a smoother with two different weights, multigrid is an exact solver.

 Investors Embrace Gender Diversity, Not Female CEOs: The Role of Gender in Startup Fundraising	, Christopher Cassion, Yuhang Qian, Constant Bossou, Margareta Ackermantextrmchar startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The allocation of venture capital is one of the primary factors determining who takes products to market, which startups succeed or fail, and as such who gets to participate in the shaping of our collective economy. While gender diversity contributes to startup success, most funding is allocated to male-only entrepreneurial teams. In the wake of COVID-19, 2020 is seeing a notable decline in funding to female and mixed-gender teams, giving raise to an urgent need to study and correct the longstanding gender bias in startup funding allocation.	
 A Peculiar ICME Event in August 2018 Observed with the Global Muon Detector Network			None	We demonstrate that global observations of high-energy cosmic rays contribute to understanding unique characteristics of a large-scale magnetic flux rope causing a magnetic storm in August 2018. Following a weak interplanetary shock on 25 August 2018, a magnetic flux rope caused an unexpectedly large geomagnetic storm. It is likely that this event became geoeffective because the flux rope was accompanied by a corotating interaction region and compressed by high-speed solar wind following the flux rope. In fact, a Forbush decrease was observed in cosmic-ray data inside the flux rope as expected, and a significant cosmic-ray density increase exceeding the unmodulated level before the shock was also observed near the trailing edge of the flux rope. The cosmic-ray density increase can be interpreted in terms of the adiabatic heating of cosmic rays near the trailing edge of the flux rope, as the corotating interaction region prevents free expansion of the flux rope and results in the compression near the trailing edge. A northeast-directed spatial gradient in the cosmic-ray density was also derived during the cosmic-ray density increase, suggesting that the center of the heating near the trailing edge is located northeast of Earth. This is one of the best examples demonstrating that the observation of high-energy cosmic rays provides us with information that can only be derived from the cosmic ray measurements to observationally constrain the three-dimensional macroscopic picture of the interaction between coronal mass ejections and the ambient solar wind, which is essential for prediction of large magnetic storms.	
 Modeling Spatial Nonstationarity via Deformable Convolutions for Deep Traffic Flow Prediction	WeiZeng,,Chengqiao Lin,Kang Liu,JuncongLin,,Anthony Tung	None	None	Deep neural networks are being increasingly used for short-term traffic flow prediction, which can be generally categorized as convolutional (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs). CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction by taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves better performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to region-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying territory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to learn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with fixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics of local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable convolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional offsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity. On this basis, we design a deep deformable convolutional residual network, namely DeFlow-Net , that can effectively model global spatial dependence, local spatial nonstationarity, and temporal periodicity of traffic flows. Furthermore, to better fit with convolutions, we suggest to first aggregate traffic flows according to pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions based on traffic flows, then dispose to sequentially organized raster images for network input. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic flows demonstrate that DeFlow-Net outperforms GNNs and existing CNNs using standard convolutions, and spatial partition by pre-conceived regions or self-organized regions further enhances the performance. We also demonstrate the advantage of DeFlow-Net in maintaining spatial autocorrelation, and reveal the impacts of partition shapes and scales on deep traffic flow prediction.

Also we have shown GMMG avoids the aforementioned ‚Äúbulk-boundary unitarity clash‚Äù. Here instead of A d S 3 ùê¥ ùëë subscript ùëÜ 3 AdS_{3} italic_A italic_d italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT space we consider asymptotically flat space, and study this model in the flat limit. The dual field theory of GMMG in the flat limit is a B M S 3 ùêµ ùëÄ subscript ùëÜ 3 BMS_{3} italic_B italic_M italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT invariant field theory, dubbed (BMSFT) and we have BMS algebra asymptotically instead of Virasoro algebra. In fact here we present an evidence for this claim. Entanglement entropy of GMMG is calculated in the background in the flat null infinity. Our evidence for mentioned claim is the result for entanglement entropy in filed theory side and in the bulk (in the gravity side). At first using Cardy formula and Rindler transformation, we calculate entanglement entropy of BMSFT in three different cases. Zero temperature on the plane and on the cylinder, and non-zero temperature case. Then we obtain the entanglement entropy in the bulk. Our results in gravity side are exactly in agreement with field theory calculations.

 Baseline Pruning-Based Approach to Trojan Detection in Neural Networks	Peter Bajcsy and Michael Majurski Information Technology LaboratoryNational Institute of Standards and Technology Bureau Drive Gaithersburg, MD Email peterbajcsynistgov	None	None	This paper addresses the problem of detecting trojans in neural networks (NNs) by analyzing systematically pruned NN models. Our pruning-based approach consists of three main steps. First, detect any deviations from the reference look-up tables of model file sizes and model graphs. Next, measure the accuracy of a set of systematically pruned NN models following multiple pruning schemas. Finally, classify a NN model as clean or poisoned by applying a mapping between accuracy measurements and NN model labels.

Due to the differences in the propagation conditions, wireless aerial channels‚Äô features differ from those of terrestrial wireless channels; therefore, unmanned aerial vehicle path loss models are often different from conventional terrestrial wireless channel path loss models. A mathematical propagation model is proposed in this paper to estimate the Ground-to-Air path loss between a wireless device and a low-altitude platform using the frequency bands of the millimeter wave. The suggested model of Ground-to-Air path loss will assist academic researchers in formulating several vital problems.

 Optimal transportation of grain boundaries: A forward model for predicting migration mechanisms	Ian Chesser, Elizabeth Holm, Brandon Runnels	ichesser@andrew.cmu.edu	Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213	It has been hypothesized that the most likely atomic rearrangement mechanism during grain boundary (GB) migration is the one that minimizes the lengths of atomic displacements in the dichromatic pattern. In this work, we recast the problem of atomic displacement minimization during GB migration as an optimal transport (OT) problem. Under the assumption of a small potential energy barrier for atomic rearrangement, the principle of stationary action applied to GB migration is reduced to the determination of the Wasserstein metric for two point sets. In order to test the minimum distance hypothesis, optimal displacement patterns predicted on the basis of a regularized OT based forward model are compared to molecular dynamics (MD) GB migration data for a variety of GB types and temperatures. Limits of applicability of the minimum distance hypothesis and interesting consequences of the OT formulation are discussed in the context of MD data analysis for twist GBs, general Œ£ 3 Œ£ 3 \Sigma 3 roman_Œ£ 3 twin boundaries and a tilt GB that exhibits shear coupling. The forward model may be used to predict atomic displacement patterns for arbitrary disconnection modes and a variety of metastable states, facilitating the analysis of multimodal GB migration data.	
 A transformer based approach for fighting COVID-19 fake news	SM SadiqUrRahman Shifath, Mohammad Faiyaz Khan, Md Saiful Islam	None	None	The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 has caused humanity to come to a stand-still and brought with it a plethora of other problems.

 Robust Android Malware Detection System against Adversarial Attacks using Q-Learning	Hemant Rathore, Sanjay Sahay, Piyush NikamBITS Pilani, Department of CS IS, Goa Campus, Mohit SewakSecurity Compliance Research, Microsoft, India	None	None	Since the inception of Android OS, smartphones sales have been growing exponentially, and today it enjoys the monopoly in the smartphone marketplace. The widespread adoption of Android smartphones has drawn the attention of malware designers, which threatens the Android ecosystem. The current state-of-the-art Android malware detection systems are based on machine learning and deep learning models. Despite having superior performance, these models are susceptible to adversarial attack. Therefore in this paper, we developed eight Android malware detection models based on machine learning and deep neural network and investigated their robustness against the adversarial attacks. For the purpose, we created new variants of malware using Reinforcement Learning, which will be misclassified as benign by the existing Android malware detection models. We propose two novel attack strategies, namely single policy attack and multiple policy attack using reinforcement learning for white-box and grey-box scenario respectively. Putting ourselves in adversary‚Äô shoes, we designed adversarial attacks on the detection models with the goal of maximising fooling rate, while making minimum modifications to the Android application and ensuring that the app‚Äôs functionality and behaviour does not change. We achieved an average fooling rate of 44.21 % percent 44.21 44.21\% 44.21 % and 53.20 % percent 53.20 53.20\% 53.20 % across all the eight detection models with maximum five modifications using a single policy attack and multiple policy attack, respectively. The highest fooling rate of 86.09 % percent 86.09 86.09\% 86.09 % with five changes was attained against the decision tree based model using the multiple policy approach. Finally, we propose an adversarial defence strategy which reduces the average fooling rate by threefold to 15.22 % percent 15.22 15.22\% 15.22 % against a single policy attack, thereby increasing the robustness of the detection models i.e. the proposed model can effectively detect variants (metamorphic) of malware. The experimental analysis shows that our proposed Android malware detection system using reinforcement learning is more robust against adversarial attacks.

 Computational irreducibility and compatibilism: towards a formalization	Marius Krumm, Markus PMller	None	None	If our actions are determined by the laws of nature, can we meaningfully claim to possess free will? Compatibilists argue that the answer is yes, and that free will is compatible with complete determinism. Previously, it has been suggested that the notion of computational irreducibility can shed light on this relation: it implies that there cannot in general be ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù to the decisions of agents, explaining why deterministic agents often appear to have free will. In this paper, we introduce a variant of computational irreducibility that intends to capture more accurately aspects of actual (as opposed to apparent) free will: computational sourcehood, i.e. the phenomenon that the successful prediction of a process‚Äô outputs must typically involve an almost-exact representation of the relevant features of that process, regardless of the time it takes to arrive at the prediction. We conjecture that many processes have this property, and we study different possibilities for how to formalize this conjecture in terms of universal Turing machines. While we are not able to settle the conjecture, we give several results and constructions that shed light on the quest for its correct formulation.

 There exist transitive piecewise smooth vector fields on ùïä¬≤ but not robustly transitive.	Rodrigo Euzbio, Joaby Juc, Rgis Varo	euzebio@ufg.br	Instituto de Matem√°tica e Estat√≠stica, IME-UFG, Goi√¢nia-GO, Brazil.	It is well known that smooth (or continuous) vector fields cannot be topologically transitive on the sphere ùïä 2 superscript ùïä 2 \mathbb{S}^{2} blackboard_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Piecewise-smooth vector fields, on the other hand, may present non-trivial recurrence even on ùïä 2 superscript ùïä 2 \mathbb{S}^{2} blackboard_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . Accordingly, in this paper the existence of topologically transitive piecewise-smooth vector fields on ùïä 2 superscript ùïä 2 \mathbb{S}^{2} blackboard_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is proved, see Theorem A . We also prove that transitivity occurs alongside the presence of some particular portions of the phase portrait known as sliding region and escaping region . More precisely, Theorem B states that, under the presence of transitivity, trajectories must interchange between sliding and escaping regions through tangency points. In addition, we prove that every transitive piecewise-smooth vector field is neither robustly transitive nor structural stable on ùïä 2 superscript ùïä 2 \mathbb{S}^{2} blackboard_S start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , see Theorem C . We finish the paper proving Theorem D addressing non-robustness on general compact two-dimensional manifolds.

Miroslav Bures, Bestoun Ahmed, Vaclav Rechtberger, Matej Klima, Michal Trnka, Miroslav Jaros, Xavier Bellekens, Dani Almog, Pavel Herout	None	None	With the rapid growth of the contemporary Internet of Things (IoT) market, the established systems raise a number of concerns regarding the reliability and the potential presence of critical integration defects. In this paper, we present a PatrIoT framework that aims to provide flexible support to construct an effective IoT system testbed to implement automated interoperability and integration testing. The framework allows scaling from a pure physical testbed to a simulated environment using a number of predefined modules and elements to simulate an IoT device or part of the tested infrastructure. PatrIoT also contains a set of reference example testbeds and several sets of example automated tests for a smart street use case.	
 BENDR: using transformers and a contrastive self-supervised learning task to learn from massive amounts of EEG data.	Demetres KostasUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaVector Institute, Toronto, CanadaStphane ArocaOuelletteUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaVector Institute, Toronto, CanadaFrank RudziczUniversity of Toronto, Toronto, CanadaVector Institute, Toronto, CanadaLi Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, Toronto, Canada	None	None	Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain-computer-interface (BCI) classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage the newly (publicly) available massive EEG datasets. We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modelling (LM), that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data, towards the development of encephalography modelling (EM) with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modelling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.	
 From pixels to notes: a computational implementation of synaesthesia for cultural artefacts	Dimitrios Kritikos, Kostas Karpouzis	kkarpou@cs.ntua.gr	None	Synaesthesia is a condition that enables people to sense information in the form of several senses at once. This work describes a Python implementation of a simulation of synaesthesia between listening to music and viewing a painting. Based on Scriabin‚Äôs definition, we developed a deterministic process to produce a melody after processing a painting, mimicking the production of notes from colours in the field of view of persons experiencing synaesthesia.	
 Critical Phenomena and Reentrant Phase Transition of Asymptotically Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m Black Holes	Mehrab Momennia,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Seyed Hossein Hendi,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	By considering a small correction to the Maxwell field, we show that the resultant black hole solutions (also known as the asymptotically Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m black holes) undergo the reentrant phase transition and can have a novel phase behavior. We also show that such a small nonlinear correction of the Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m black holes has high effects on the phase structure of the solutions. It leads to a new classification in the canonical ensemble of extended phase space providing the values of the nonlinearity parameter Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± being Œ± ‚™ã 4 q 2 / 7 less-than-or-equals-or-greater-than ùõº 4 superscript ùëû 2 7 \alpha\lesseqqgtr 4q^{2}/7 italic_Œ± ‚™ã 4 italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / 7 . We shall study these three classes and investigate deviations from those of the standard Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m solutions. Interestingly, we find that there is the reentrant phase transition for Œ± < 4 q 2 / 7 ùõº 4 superscript ùëû 2 7 \alpha<4q^{2}/7 italic_Œ± < 4 italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / 7 , and for the case of Œ± = 4 q 2 / 7 ùõº 4 superscript ùëû 2 7 \alpha=4q^{2}/7 italic_Œ± = 4 italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / 7 there is no phase transition below (at) the critical point.

 1 Introduction			None	We present an alternative implementation of the Kalman filter employed for track fitting within the LHCb experiment. It uses simple parametrizations for the extrapolation of particle trajectories in the field of the LHCb dipole magnet and for the effects of multiple scattering in the detector material. A speedup of more than a factor of four is achieved while maintaining the quality of the estimated track quantities. This Kalman filter implementation could be used in the purely software-based trigger of the LHCb upgrade.

 Equilibrium and Socially optimal of a double-sided queueing system with two-mass point matching time	Zhen WangaastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Cheryl YangbbstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Liwei LiuaastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Yiqiang Zhaob,b,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italicb , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTaastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT italica endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We study a passenger-taxi double-ended queue with impatient passengers and two-point matching time in this paper. The system considered in this paper is different from those considered in the existing literature, which fully considers the matching time between passengers and taxis, and the taxi capacity of the system. The objective is to get the equilibrium joining strategy and the socially optimal strategy under two information levels. For the practical consideration of the airport terminal scenario, two different information levels are considered. The theoretical results show that the passenger utility function in the partially observable case is monotonic. For the complex form of social welfare function of the partially observable case, we use a split derivation. The equilibrium strategy and socially optimal strategy of the observable case are threshold-type. Furthermore, some representative numerical scenarios are used to visualize the theoretical results. The numerical scenarios illustrate the influence of parameters on the equilibrium strategy and socially optimal strategy under two information levels. Finally, the optimal social welfare for the two information levels with the same parameters are compared.	
 Contrastive analysis for scatterplot-based representations of dimensionality reduction	Wilson MarclioJr, Danilo Eler, Rogrio Garcia	None	Faculty of Sciences and Technology, S√£o Paulo State University (UNESP), Presidente Prudente, SP 19060-900, Brazil	Cluster interpretation after dimensionality reduction (DR) is a ubiquitous part of exploring multidimensional datasets. DR results are frequently represented by scatterplots, where spatial proximity encodes similarity among data samples. In the literature, techniques support the understanding of scatterplots‚Äô organization by visualizing the importance of the features for cluster definition with layout enrichment strategies. However, current approaches usually focus on global information, hampering the analysis whenever the focus is to understand the differences among clusters. Thus, this paper introduces a methodology to visually explore DR results and interpret clusters‚Äô formation based on contrastive analysis. We also introduce a bipartite graph to visually interpret and explore the relationship between the statistical variables employed to understand how the data features influence cluster formation. Our approach is demonstrated through case studies, in which we explore two document collections related to news articles and tweets about COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, we evaluate our approach through quantitative results to demonstrate its robustness to support multidimensional analysis.	
 Compositional Game Theory, Compositionally		None	None	We present a new compositional approach to compositional game theory (CGT) based upon Arrows, a concept originally from functional programming, closely related to Tambara modules, and operators to build new Arrows from old. We model equilibria as a module over an Arrow and define an operator to build a new Arrow from such a module over an existing Arrow. We also model strategies as graded Arrows and define an operator which builds a new Arrow by taking the colimit of a graded Arrow. A final operator builds a graded Arrow from a graded bimodule. We use this compositional approach to CGT to show how known and previously unknown variants of open games can be proven to form symmetric monoidal categories.

 Measuring Intelligence and Growth Rate: Variations on Hibbard‚Äôs Intelligence Measure	Samuel AlexandersamuelallenalexandergmailcomPrimary AuthorThe USSecurities and Exchange Commission, New York Regional OfficeBill HibbardSpace Science and Engineering Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI	None	None	In 2011, Hibbard suggested an intelligence measure for agents who compete in an adversarial sequence prediction game. We argue that Hibbard‚Äôs idea should actually be considered as two separate ideas: first, that the intelligence of such agents can be measured based on the growth rates of the runtimes of the competitors that they defeat; and second, one specific (somewhat arbitrary) method for measuring said growth rates. Whereas Hibbard‚Äôs intelligence measure is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which taxonomies are novel in that they challenge conventional notions of what an intelligence measure should look like. We discuss how intelligence measurement of sequence predictors can indirectly serve as intelligence measurement for agents with Artificial General Intelligence (AGIs).

Young moving groups allow to probe this population, since discs are expected to have been brighter early on. This paper considers the population of F stars in the 23 Myr-old BPMG where we find that 9/12 targets possess discs. We also analyse archival ALMA data to derive radii for 4 of the discs, presenting the first image of the 63au radius disc of HD 164249. Comparing the BPMG results to disc samples from ‚àº 45 similar-to absent 45 \sim 45 ‚àº 45 Myr and ‚àº 150 similar-to absent 150 \sim 150 ‚àº 150 Myr-old moving groups, and to discs found around field stars, we find the disc incidence rate in young moving groups is comparable to that of the BPMG and significantly higher than that of field stars. The BPMG discs tend to be smaller than those around field stars. However, this difference is not statistically significant due to the small number of targets. Yet, by analysing the fractional luminosity vs disc radius parameter space we find that the fractional luminosities in the populations considered drop by two orders of magnitude within the first 100 Myr. This is much faster than expected by collisional evolution, implying a decay equivalent to 1 / age 2 1 superscript age 2 1/\text{age}^{2} 1 / age start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . We attribute this depletion to embedded planets which would be around 170 M earth subscript ùëÄ earth M_{\text{earth}} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT earth end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to cause a depletion on the appropriate timescale. However, we cannot rule out that different birth environments of nearby young clusters result in brighter debris discs than the progenitors of field stars which likely formed in a more dense environment.	
 VAE¬≤: Preventing Posterior Collapse of Variational Video Predictions in the Wild	Yizhou Zhou,Chong Luo,Xiaoyan Sun,ZhengJun Zha,Wenjun ZengUniversity of Science Technology of ChinaMicrosoft Research Asiazyzmailustceducn zhazjustceducn xysun, cluo, wezengmicrosoftcom	None	None	Predicting future frames of video sequences is challenging due to the complex and stochastic nature of the problem. Video prediction methods based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have been a great success, but they require the training data to contain multiple possible futures for an observed video sequence. This is hard to be fulfilled when videos are captured in the wild where any given observation only has a determinate future. As a result, training a vanilla VAE model with these videos inevitably causes posterior collapse. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel VAE structure, dabbed VAE-in-VAE or VAE 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT . The key idea is to explicitly introduce stochasticity into the VAE. We treat part of the observed video sequence as a random transition state that bridges its past and future, and maximize the likelihood of a Markov Chain over the video sequence under all possible transition states. A tractable lower bound is proposed for this intractable objective function and an end-to-end optimization algorithm is designed accordingly. VAE 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT can mitigate the posterior collapse problem to a large extent, as it breaks the direct dependence between future and observation and does not directly regress the determinate future provided by the training data. We carry out experiments on a large-scale dataset called Cityscapes, which contains videos collected from a number of urban cities. Results show that VAE 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT is capable of predicting diverse futures and is more resistant to posterior collapse than the other state-of-the-art VAE-based approaches. We believe that VAE 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT is also applicable to other stochastic sequence prediction problems where training data are lack of stochasticity.	
 Edge Federated Learning Via Unit-Modulus Over-The-Air Computation	ShuaiWang,,YuncongHong,,RuiWang,,Qi Hao,,YikChungWu,,and DerrickWingKwanNg	None	None	Edge federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that trains a global parametric model from distributed datasets based on wireless communications. This paper proposes a unit-modulus over-the-air computation (UMAirComp) framework to facilitate efficient edge federated learning, which simultaneously uploads local model parameters and updates global model parameters via analog beamforming. The proposed framework avoids sophisticated baseband signal processing, leading to low communication delays and implementation costs. Training loss bounds of UMAirComp FL systems are derived and two low-complexity large-scale optimization algorithms, termed penalty alternating minimization (PAM) and accelerated gradient projection (AGP), are proposed to minimize the nonconvex nonsmooth loss bound. Simulation results show that the proposed UMAirComp framework with PAM algorithm achieves a smaller mean square error of model parameters‚Äô estimation, training loss, and test error compared with other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed UMAirComp framework with AGP algorithm achieves satisfactory performance while reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude compared with existing optimization algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of UMAirComp in a vehicle-to-everything autonomous driving simulation platform. It is found that autonomous driving tasks are more sensitive to model parameter errors than other tasks since the neural networks for autonomous driving contain sparser model parameters.	
 On the Lagrangian structure of transport equations: relativistic Vlasov systems	Henrique Borrin, Diego Marcon	henrique.borrin@ufrgs.br	Departamento de Matem√°tica Pura e Aplicada, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre - RS, Brazil.	We study the Lagrangian structure of relativistic Vlasov systems, such as the relativistic Vlasov-Poisson and the relativistic quasi-eletrostatic limit of Vlasov-Maxwell equations. We show that renormalized solutions of these systems are Lagrangian and that these notions of solution, in fact, coincide. As a consequence, finite-energy solutions are shown to be transported by a global flow. Moreover, we extend the notion of generalized solution for ‚Äúeffective‚Äù densities and we prove its existence. Finally, under a higher integrability assumption of the initial condition, we show that solutions have every energy bounded, even in the gravitational case. These results extend to our setting those obtained by Ambrosio, Colombo, and Figalli [ vlasovpoisson ] for the Vlasov-Poisson system; here, we analyse relativistic systems and we consider the contribution of the magnetic force into the evolution equation.

 Stagnation Detection with Randomized Local Search	Amirhossein RajabiTechnical University of DenmarkKgs LyngbyDenmarkamrajdtudk, Carsten WittTechnical University of DenmarkKgs LyngbyDenmarkcawidtudk	None	None	Recently a mechanism called stagnation detection was proposed that automatically adjusts the mutation rate of evolutionary algorithms when they encounter local optima. The so-called SD-(1+1) EA introduced by Rajabi and Witt (GECCO 2020) adds stagnation detection to the classical (1+1) EA with standard bit mutation, which flips each bit independently with some mutation rate, and raises the mutation rate when the algorithm is likely to have encountered local optima.	
 Influence of interaction softness in phase separation of active particles	Monika Sanoria, Raghunath Chelakkot, Amitabha Nandi	None	None	Using a minimal model of active Brownian discs, we study the effect of a crucial parameter, namely the softness of the inter-particle repulsion, on motility-induced phase separation. We show that an increase in particle softness reduces the ability of the system to phase-separate and the system exhibit a delayed transition. After phase separation, the system state properties can be explained by a single relevant lengthscale, the effective inter-particle distance. We estimate this lengthscale analytically and use it to rescale the state properties at dense phase for systems with different interaction softness. Using this lengthscale, we provide a scaling relation for the time taken to phase separate which shows a high sensitivity to the interaction softness.	
 Enhancing Sequence-to-Sequence Neural Lemmatization with External Resources	Kirill MilintsevichInstitute of Computer ScienceUniversity of TartuTartu, EstoniaKairit SirtsInstitute of Computer ScienceUniversity of TartuTartu, Estonia	None	None	We propose a novel hybrid approach to lemmatization 1 1 1 https://github.com/501Good/lexicon-enhanced-lemmatization that enhances the seq2seq neural model with additional lemmas extracted from an external lexicon or a rule-based system. During training, the enhanced lemmatizer learns both to generate lemmas via a sequential decoder and copy the lemma characters from the external candidates supplied during run-time. Our lemmatizer enhanced with candidates extracted from the Apertium morphological analyzer achieves statistically significant improvements compared to baseline models not utilizing additional lemma information, achieves an average accuracy of 97.25% on a set of 23 UD languages, which is 0.55% higher than obtained with the Stanford Stanza model on the same set of languages. We also compare with other methods of integrating external data into lemmatization and show that our enhanced system performs considerably better than a simple lexicon extension method based on the Stanza system, and it achieves complementary improvements w.r.t. the data augmentation method.

Jansky Very Large Array at 1.4, 5.5, 9.0, and 14.0 GHz. Our sample is selected from ULIRGs whose active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are not found at optical wavelengths ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 70% of the entire ULIRGs), but whose presence is suggested by mid-infrared or submillimetre observations ( > 50 absent 50 >50 > 50 % of the non-AGN ULIRGs at optical wavelengths). The statistical properties of the targets are similar to those of the entire ULIRG sample, which implies that ULIRGs have common radiative processes regardless of the presence of optical AGNs, and thus AGNs might equally contribute to the radio emission of every ULIRG. Although their spectra are mainly explained by starbursts and/or merger activity, some individual sources suggest contributions from AGNs. IRAS 00188 ‚àí - - 0856, whose optical morphology is not disturbed, shows a large nonthermal fraction and a spectral break at high frequency, which can be explained by synchrotron ageing of nonthermal plasma emitted from AGNs. In addition, we find 100-kpc scale extended emission associated with IRAS 01004 ‚àí - - 2237. The two-sided morphology and absence of extended X-ray emission suggest that this system is not induced by a merger in a cluster but originates from AGN activity.	
 Vx2Text: End-to-End Learning of Video-Based Text Generation From Multimodal Inputs	Xudong LinstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Gedas BertasiusstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jue WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, ShihFu ChangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Devi Parikh,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Lorenzo Torresani,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTColumbia UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTFacebook AIstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTGeorgia TechstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDartmouth	None	None	We present Vx2Text , a framework for text generation from multimodal inputs consisting of video plus text, speech, or audio. In order to leverage transformer networks, which have been shown to be effective at modeling language, each modality is first converted into a set of language embeddings by a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different ‚Äúvideo+ x ùë• x italic_x to text‚Äù problems without the need to design specialized network heads for each task. The proposed framework is not only conceptually simple but also remarkably effective: experiments demonstrate that our approach based on a single architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art on three video-based text-generation tasks‚Äîcaptioning, question answering and audio-visual scene-aware dialog.

We call it the boxed threshold arrangement since we show that the bounded regions of this arrangement are contained in an n ùëõ n italic_n -cube and are in one-to-one correspondence with the labeled threshold graphs on n ùëõ n italic_n vertices. The problem of counting regions of this arrangement was studied earlier by Joungmin Song. He determined the characteristic polynomial of this arrangement by relating its coefficients to the count of certain graphs. Here, we provide bijective arguments to determine the number of regions. In particular, we construct certain signed partitions of the set { ‚àí n , ‚Ä¶ , n } ‚àñ { 0 } ùëõ ‚Ä¶ ùëõ 0 \{-n,\dots,n\}\setminus\{0\} { - italic_n , ‚Ä¶ , italic_n } ‚àñ { 0 } and also construct colored threshold graphs on n ùëõ n italic_n vertices and show that both these objects are in bijection with the regions of the boxed threshold arrangement. We independently count these objects and provide a closed form formula for the number of regions.	
 Permutations Avoiding Certain Partially-ordered Patterns	Kai Ting Keshia Yap, David WehlaustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Imed ZaguiaabsentstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	yap.keshia@gmail.com	"Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Queens University,
48 University Ave. Jeffery Hall Kingston, ON Canada K7L 3N6"	A permutation œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ contains a pattern œÉ ùúé \sigma italic_œÉ if and only if there is a subsequence in œÄ ùúã \pi italic_œÄ with its letters are in the same relative order as those in œÉ ùúé \sigma italic_œÉ . Partially ordered patterns (POPs) provide a convenient way to denote patterns in which the relative order of some of the letters does not matter. This paper elucidates connections between the avoidance sets of a few POPs with other combinatorial objects, directly answering five open questions posed by Gao and Kitaev [ 5 ] . This was done by thoroughly analysing the avoidance sets and developing recursive algorithms to derive these sets and their corresponding combinatorial objects in parallel, which yielded a natural bijection. We also analysed an avoidance set whose simple permutations are enumerated by the Fibonacci numbers and derived an algorithm to obtain them recursively.	
 Aharonov-Bohm effect in three-dimensional higher-order topological insulators	Kun Luo, Hao Geng, Li Sheng, Wei Chen, Xing	None	None	The 1D hinge states are the hallmark of the 3D higher-order topological insulators (HOTI), which may lead to interesting transport properties. Here, we study the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in the interferometer constructed by the hinge states in the normal metal-HOTI junctions with a transverse magnetic field. We show that the AB oscillation of the conductance can clearly manifest the spatial configurations of such hinge states. The magnetic fluxes encircled by various interfering loops are composed of two basic ones, so that the oscillation of the conductance by varying the magnetic field contains different frequency components universally related to each other. Specifically, the four dominant frequencies œâ x , y subscript ùúî ùë• ùë¶ \omega_{x,y} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x , italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and œâ x ¬± y subscript ùúî plus-or-minus ùë• ùë¶ \omega_{x\pm y} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x ¬± italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT satisfy the relations œâ x ¬± y = œâ x ¬± œâ y subscript ùúî plus-or-minus ùë• ùë¶ plus-or-minus subscript ùúî ùë• subscript ùúî ùë¶ \omega_{x\pm y}=\omega_{x}\pm\omega_{y} italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x ¬± italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ¬± italic_œâ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , which generally holds for different magnetic field, sample size, bias voltage and weak disorder. Our results provide a unique and robust signature of the hinge states and pave the way for exploring AB effect in the 3D HOTI.	
 Quantitative Resilience of Linear Driftless Systems	JeanBaptiste Bouvier, Kathleen Xu and Melkior Ornik	None	None	This paper introduces the notion of quantitative resilience of a control system. Following prior work, we study systems enduring a loss of control authority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target after a partial loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction, a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to its initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new concept of quantitative resilience. We define such a metric as the maximal ratio of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Naive computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a complex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear optimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: an opinion dynamics scenario and a trajectory controller for low-thrust spacecrafts.	
 Local Coherence of Hearts associated with Thomason Filtrations	Lorenzo Martini, Carlos EParra	lorenzo.martini-2@unitn.it	Dipartimento di MatematicaUniversit√† di TrentoVia Sommarive 14, 38123 Povo (Trento), Italy	Any Thomason filtration of a commutative ring yields (at least) two t-structures in the derived category of the ring, one of which is compactly generated [ Hrb20 , HHZ21 ] . We study the hearts of these two t-structures and prove that they coincide in case of a weakly bounded below filtration. Prompted by [ S≈†20 ] , in which it is proved that the heart of a compactly generated t-structure in a triangulated category with coproduct is a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category, we study the local coherence of the hearts associated with a weakly bounded below Thomason filtration, achieving a useful recursive characterisation in case of a finite length filtration. Low length cases involve hereditary torsion classes of finite type of the ring, and even their Happel‚ÄìReiten‚ÄìSmal√∏ hearts; in these cases, the relevant characterisations are given by few module-theoretic conditions.	
 Critical Level Statistics at the Many-Body Localization Transition Region	WenJia Rao	wjrao@hdu.edu.cn	None	We study the critical level statistics at the many-body localization (MBL) transition region in random spin systems. By employing the inter-sample randomness as indicator, we manage to locate the MBL transition point in both orthogonal and unitary models. We further count the n ùëõ n italic_n -th order gap ratio distributions at the transition region up to n = 4 ùëõ 4 n=4 italic_n = 4 , and find they fit well with the short-range plasma model (SRPM) with inverse temperature Œ≤ = 1 ùõΩ 1 \beta=1 italic_Œ≤ = 1 for orthogonal model and Œ≤ = 2 ùõΩ 2 \beta=2 italic_Œ≤ = 2 for unitary. These critical level statistics are argued to be universal by comparing results from systems both with and without total S z subscript ùëÜ ùëß S_{z} italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT conservation. We also point out that these critical distributions can emerge from the spectrum of a Poisson ensemble, which indicates the thermal-MBL transition point is more affected by the MBL phase rather than thermal phase.	
 Some aspects of the cosmological dynamics in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity	Dmitry Chirkov, Sergey Pavluchenko	None	None	We study some aspects of dynamical compactification scenario where stabilisation of extra dimensions occurs due to presence the Gauss-Bonnet term and non-zero spatial curvature. In the framework of the model under consideration there exists two-stages scenario of evolution of a Universe: on the first stage, the space evolves from a totally anisotropic state to the state with 3-dimensional (corresponding to our ‚Äúreal‚Äù world) expanding and D ùê∑ D italic_D -dimensional contracting isotropic subspaces; on the second stage, constant curvature of extra dimensions begins to play role and provide compactification of extra dimensions. It is already known that such a scenario is realizable when constant curvature of extra dimensions is negative. Here we show that a range of coupling constants for which exponential solutions with 3-dimensional expanding and D ùê∑ D italic_D -dimensional contracting isotropic subspaces are stable is located in a zone where compactification solutions with positively curved extra space are unstable, so that two-stage scenario analogous to the one described above is not realizable. Also we study ‚Äúnearly-Friedmann‚Äù regime for the case of arbitrary constant curvature of extra dimensions and describe new parametrization of the general solution for the model under consideration which provide elegant way of describing areas of existence over parameters space.	
 The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross-sections of simulated ŒõCDM galaxy clusters	Andrew RobertsonInstitute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH LE, UK	None	None	We investigate a recent claim that observed galaxy clusters produce an order of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) than simulated clusters in a Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM cosmology. We take galaxy clusters from the c-eagle hydrodynamical simulations and calculate the expected amount of GGSL for sources placed behind the clusters at different redshifts. The probability of a source lensed by one of the most massive c-eagle clusters being multiply imaged by an individual cluster member is in good agreement with that inferred for observed clusters. We show that numerically converged results for the GGSL probability require higher resolution simulations than had been used previously. On top of this, different galaxy formation models predict cluster substructures with different central densities, such that the GGSL probabilities in Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM cannot yet be robustly predicted. Overall, we find that galaxy-galaxy strong lensing within clusters is not currently in tension with the Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM cosmological model.	
 The Newcomb‚ÄìBenford law: Scale invariance and a simple Markov process based on it	Andrea Burgos, Andrs Santos	anburgosr@alumnos.unex.es	None	The Newcomb‚ÄìBenford law, also known as the first-digit law, gives the probability distribution associated with the first digit of a dataset, so that, for example, the first significant digit has a probability of 30.1 30.1 30.1 30.1 % of being 1 1 1 1 and 4.58 4.58 4.58 4.58 % of being 9 9 9 9 . This law can be extended to the second and next significant digits. This article presents an introduction to the discovery of the law, its derivation from the scale invariance property, as well as some applications and examples. Additionally, a simple model of a Markov process inspired by scale invariance is proposed. Within this model, it is proved that the probability distribution irreversibly converges to the Newcomb‚ÄìBenford law, in analogy to the irreversible evolution toward equilibrium of physical systems in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.	
 Precise limits on the charge-2/3 ùëà‚ÇÅ vector leptoquark	Arvind Bhaskar, Diganta Das, Tanumoy Mandal, Subhadip Mitra, Cyrin Neeraj	arvind.bhaskar@research.iiit.ac.in	None	The U 1 subscript ùëà 1 U_{1} italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT leptoquark is known to be a suitable candidate for explaining the semileptonic B ùêµ B italic_B -decay anomalies. We derive precise limits on its parameter space relevant for the anomalies from the current LHC high- p T subscript ùëù T p_{\rm T} italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT dilepton data. We consider an exhaustive list of possible B ùêµ B italic_B -anomalies-motivated simple scenarios with one or two new couplings that can also be used as templates for obtaining bounds on more complicated scenarios. To obtain precise limits, we systematically consider all possible U 1 subscript ùëà 1 U_{1} italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT production processes that can contribute to the dilepton searches, including the resonant pair and single productions, nonresonant t ùë° t italic_t -channel U 1 subscript ùëà 1 U_{1} italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT exchange, as well as its large interference with the Standard Model background. We demonstrate how the inclusion of resonant production contributions in the dilepton signal can lead to appreciably improved exclusion limits. We point out new search channels of U 1 subscript ùëà 1 U_{1} italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that can act as unique tests of the flavour-motivated models. The template scenarios can also be used for future U 1 subscript ùëà 1 U_{1} italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT searches at the LHC. We compare the LHC limits with other relevant flavour bounds and find that a TeV-scale U 1 subscript ùëà 1 U_{1} italic_U start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can accommodate both R D ( * ) subscript ùëÖ superscript ùê∑ R_{D^{(*)}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and R K ( * ) subscript ùëÖ superscript ùêæ R_{K^{(*)}} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( * ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT anomalies while satisfying all the bounds.

 Determining the Angle-of-Arrival of an Radio-Frequency Source with a Rydberg Atom-Based Sensor	Amy Robinson, Nikunjkumar Prajapati, Damir Senic, Matthew Simons, ChristopherLHolloway	None	None	In this work, we demonstrate the use of a Rydberg atom-based sensor for determining the angle-of-arrival of an incident radio-frequency (RF) wave or signal. The technique uses electromagnetically induced transparency in Rydberg atomic vapor in conjunction with a heterodyne Rydberg atom-based mixer. The Rydberg atom mixer measures the phase of the incident RF wave at two different locations inside an atomic vapor cell. The phase difference at these two locations is related to the direction of arrival of the incident RF wave. To demonstrate this approach, we measure phase differences of an incident 19.18 GHz wave at two locations inside a vapor cell filled with cesium atoms for various incident angles. Comparisons of these measurements to both full-wave simulation and to a plane-wave theoretical model show that these atom-based sub-wavelength phase measurements can be used to determine the angle-of-arrival of an RF field.	
 Autoregressive Denoising Diffusion Models for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting	Kashif Rasul, Calvin Seward, Ingmar Schuster, Roland Vollgraf	None	None	In this work, we propose TimeGrad , an autoregressive model for multivariate probabilistic time series forecasting which samples from the data distribution at each time step by estimating its gradient. To this end, we use diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models closely connected to score matching and energy-based methods. Our model learns gradients by optimizing a variational bound on the data likelihood and at inference time converts white noise into a sample of the distribution of interest through a Markov chain using Langevin sampling. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed autoregressive denoising diffusion model is the new state-of-the-art multivariate probabilistic forecasting method on real-world data sets with thousands of correlated dimensions. We hope that this method is a useful tool for practitioners and lays the foundation for future research in this area.	
 A Neural Few-Shot Text Classification Reality Check	Thomas Dopierre, Christophe Gravier, , 	None	None	Modern classification models tend to struggle when the amount of annotated data is scarce. To overcome this issue, several neural few-shot classification models have emerged, yielding significant progress over time, both in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In the latter, such models used to rely on fixed word embeddings before the advent of transformers. Additionally, some models used in Computer Vision are yet to be tested in NLP applications. In this paper, we compare all these models, first adapting those made in the field of image processing to NLP, and second providing them access to transformers. We then test these models equipped with the same transformer-based encoder on the intent detection task, known for having a large number of classes. Our results reveal that while methods perform almost equally on the ARSC dataset, this is not the case for the Intent Detection task, where the most recent and supposedly best competitors perform worse than older and simpler ones (while all are given access to transformers). We also show that a simple baseline is surprisingly strong. All the new developed models, as well as the evaluation framework, are made publicly available 1 1 1 https://github.com/tdopierre/FewShotText .	
 Experimental test of sequential weak measurements for certified quantum randomness extraction	Giulio Foletto, Matteo Padovan, Marco Avesani, Hamid Tebyanian, Paolo Villoresi, Giuseppe Vallone	None	None	Quantum nonlocality offers a secure way to produce random numbers: Their unpredictability is intrinsic and can be certified just by observing the statistic of the measurement outcomes, without assumptions on how they are produced. To do this, entangled pairs are generated and measured to violate a Bell inequality with the outcome statistics. However, after a projective quantum measurement, entanglement is entirely destroyed and cannot be used again. This fact poses an upper bound to the amount of randomness that can be produced from each quantum state when projective measurements are employed. Instead, by using weak measurements, some entanglement can be maintained and reutilized, and a sequence of weak measurements can extract an unbounded amount of randomness from a single state as predicted in Phys. Rev. A 95 , 020102(R) (2017). We study the feasibility of these weak measurements, analyze the robustness to imperfections in the quantum state they are applied to, and then test them using an optical setup based on polarization-entangled photon pairs. We show that the weak measurements are realizable, but can improve the performance of randomness generation only in close-to-ideal conditions.	
 Visualization of Nonlinear Programming for Robot Motion Planning	David Hgele, Moataz Abdelaal, Ozgur Oguz, Marc Toussaint, Daniel Weiskopf	david.haegele@visus.uni-stuttgart.de	None	Nonlinear programming targets nonlinear optimization with constraints, which is a generic yet complex methodology involving humans for problem modeling and algorithms for problem solving. We address the particularly hard challenge of supporting domain experts in handling, understanding, and trouble-shooting high-dimensional optimization with a large number of constraints. Leveraging visual analytics, users are supported in exploring the computation process of nonlinear constraint optimization. Our system was designed for robot motion planning problems and developed in tight collaboration with domain experts in nonlinear programming and robotics. We report on the experiences from this design study, illustrate the usefulness for relevant example cases, and discuss the extension to visual analytics for nonlinear programming in general.	
 Temperature dependence of magnetization processes in Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)_ùëß magnets with different nanoscale microstructures	Leonardo Pierobon, Robin Schublin, Andrs Kovcs, Stephan Gerstl, Alexander Firlus, Urs Wyss, Rafal DuninBorkowski, Michalis Charilaou, Jrg Lffler	None	None	The characteristic microstructure of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) z ùëß {}_{z} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT alloys with SmCo 5 5 {}_{5} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 5 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT cell walls in Sm 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT Co 17 17 {}_{17} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 17 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT cells, all intersected by Zr-rich platelets, makes them some of the best performing high-temperature permanent magnets. Plentiful research has been performed to tailor the microstructure at the nanoscale, but due to its complexity many questions remain unanswered about the effect of the individual phases on the magnetic performance at different temperatures. Here, we explore this mechanism effect for three different Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) z ùëß {}_{z} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT alloys by deploying high-resolution magnetic imaging via in-situ transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional chemical analysis using atom probe tomography. We show that their microstructures differ in terms of SmCo 5 5 {}_{5} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 5 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT cell-wall and Z-phase size and density, as well as the Cu concentration in the cell walls, and demonstrate how these features influence the magnetic domain size and density and thus form different magnetic textures. Moreover, we illustrate that the dominant coercivity mechanism at room temperature is domain-wall pinning and show that magnets with a denser cell-wall network, a steeper Cu gradient across the cell-wall boundary, and thinner Z-phase platelets have a higher coercivity. We also show that the coercivity mechanism at high temperatures is domain-wall nucleation at the cell walls. Increasing the Cu concentration inside the cell walls decreases the transition temperature between pinning and nucleation, significantly decreasing the coercivity with increasing temperature. We therefore provide a detailed explanation of how the microstructure on the atomic to nanoscale directly affects the magnetic performance and provide detailed guidelines for an improved design of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr) z ùëß {}_{z} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT magnets.

 S++: A Fast and Deployable Secure-Computation Framework for Privacy-Preserving Neural Network Training	Prashanthi RamachandranShivam AgarwalArup MondalAastha ShahDebayan Gupta	None	None	We introduce S++, a simple, robust, and deployable framework for training a neural network (NN) using private data from multiple sources, using secret-shared secure function evaluation. In short, consider a virtual third party to whom every data-holder sends their inputs, and which computes the neural network: in our case, this virtual third party is actually a set of servers which individually learn nothing, even with a malicious (but non-colluding) adversary.	
 Sheffer operation in relational systems	IvanChajda and HelmutLnger	None	None	The concept of a Sheffer operation known for Boolean algebras and orthomodular lattices is extended to arbitrary directed relational systems with involution. It is proved that to every such relational system there can be assigned a Sheffer groupoid and also, conversely, every Sheffer groupoid induces a directed relational system with involution. Hence, investigations of these relational systems can be transformed to the treaty of special groupoids which form a variety of algebras. If the Sheffer operation is also commutative then the induced binary relation is antisymmetric. Moreover, commutative Sheffer groupoids form a congruence distributive variety. We characterize symmertry, antisymmetry and treansitivity of binary relations by identities and quasi-identities satisfied by an assigned Sheffer operation. The concepts of twist-products of relational systems and of Kleene relational systems are introduced. We prove that every directed relational system can be embedded into a directed relational system with involution via the twist-product construction. If the relation in question is even transitive, then the directed relational system can be embedded into a Kleene relational system. Any Sheffer operation assigned to a directed relational system ùêÄ ùêÄ \mathbf{A} bold_A with involution induces a Sheffer operation assigned to the twist-product of ùêÄ ùêÄ \mathbf{A} bold_A .	
 Two-Sided Matching Markets in the ELLIS 2020 PhD Program	Maximilian Mordig,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Riccardo Della VecchiastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Nicol CesaBianchistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Bernhard Schlkopf,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	The ELLIS PhD program is a European initiative that supports excellent young researchers by connecting them to leading researchers in AI. In particular, PhD students are supervised by two advisors from different countries: an advisor and a co-advisor. In this work we summarize the procedure that, in its final step, matches students to advisors in the ELLIS 2020 PhD program. The steps of the procedure are based on the extensive literature of two-sided matching markets and the college admissions problem (Knuth and De Bruijn, 1997 ; Gale and Shapley, 1962 ; Roth and Sotomayor, 1992 ) . We introduce PolyGS , an algorithm for the case of two-sided markets with quotas on both sides (also known as many-to-many markets) which we use throughout the selection procedure of pre-screening, interview matching and final matching with advisors. The algorithm returns a stable matching in the sense that no unmatched persons prefer to be matched together rather than with their current partners (given their indicated preferences). Roth ( 1984 ) gives evidence that only stable matchings are likely to be adhered to over time. Additionally, the matching is student-optimal. Preferences are constructed based on the rankings each side gives to the other side and the overlaps of research fields. We present and discuss the matchings that the algorithm produces in the ELLIS 2020 PhD program.	
 Generalising via Meta-Examples for Continual Learning in the Wild	Alessia Bertugli, Stefano Vincenzi, Simone Calderara, Andrea Passerini	None	None	Future deep learning systems call for techniques that can deal with the evolving nature of temporal data and scarcity of annotations when new problems occur. As a step towards this goal, we present FUSION (Few-shot UnSupervIsed cONtinual learning), a learning strategy that enables a neural network to learn quickly and continually on streams of unlabelled data and unbalanced tasks. The objective is to maximise the knowledge extracted from the unlabelled data stream (unsupervised), favor the forward transfer of previously learnt tasks and features (continual) and exploit as much as possible the supervised information when available (few-shot). The core of FUSION is MEML - Meta-Example Meta-Learning ‚Äì that consolidates a meta-representation through the use of a self-attention mechanism during a single inner loop in the meta-optimisation stage. To further enhance the capability of MEML to generalise from few data, we extend it by creating various augmented surrogate tasks and by optimising over the hardest. An extensive experimental evaluation on public computer vision benchmarks shows that FUSION outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions both in the few-shot and continual learning experimental settings. 1 1 1 The code is available at https://github.com/alessiabertugli/FUSION	
 Two Matrix Weighted Inequalities for Commutators with Fractional Integral Operators	Roy Cardenas, Joshua Isralowitz	rcardenas@albany.edu	University at Albany, SUNY, Department of Mathematics, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222	In this paper we prove two matrix weighted norm inequalities for the commutator of a fractional integral operator and multiplication by a matrix symbol. More precisely, we extend the recent results of the second author, Pott, and Treil on two matrix weighted norm inequalities for commutators of Calderon-Zygmund operators and multiplication by a matrix symbol to the fractional integral operator setting. In particular, we completely extend the fractional Bloom theory of Holmes, Rahm, and Spencer to the two matrix weighted setting with a matrix symbol.	
 Reconstructing Perceptive Images from Brain Activity by Shape-Semantic GAN	Tao FangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Yu Qi,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT,Gang Pan,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTCollege of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTState Key Lab of CADCG, Zhejiang UniversitystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTThe First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University	None	None	Reconstructing seeing images from fMRI recordings is an absorbing research area in neuroscience and provides a potential brain-reading technology. The challenge lies in that visual encoding in brain is highly complex and not fully revealed. Inspired by the theory that visual features are hierarchically represented in cortex, we propose to break the complex visual signals into multi-level components and decode each component separately. Specifically, we decode shape and semantic representations from the lower and higher visual cortex respectively, and merge the shape and semantic information to images by a generative adversarial network (Shape-Semantic GAN). This ‚Äôdivide and conquer‚Äô strategy captures visual information more accurately. Experiments demonstrate that Shape-Semantic GAN improves the reconstruction similarity and image quality, and achieves the state-of-the-art image reconstruction performance.	
 Phonon Self-Energy Effects in Migdal-Eliashberg Theory	Marsiglio	None	None	Recent work on an electron-phonon model in two-dimensions is reviewed and some new results are presented. We utilize both Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and Migdal-Eliashberg theory. The type of electron-ion coupling considered is on-site. Competing instabilities are charge density wave (CDW) and singlet superconductivity. When the electron band is half-filled, the charge density wave dominates. Away from half-filling CDW correlations actually suppress superconductivity.

 Risk-sensitive safety analysis using Conditional Value-at-Risk*	Margaret Chapman, Riccardo Bonalli, Kevin Smith, Insoon Yang, Marco Pavone, Claire Tomlin	None	None	This paper develops a safety analysis method for stochastic systems that is sensitive to the possibility and severity of rare harmful outcomes. We define risk-sensitive safe sets as sub-level sets of the solution to a non-standard optimal control problem, where a random maximum cost is assessed via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The objective function represents the maximum extent of constraint violation of the state trajectory, averaged over a given percentage of worst cases. This problem is well-motivated but difficult to solve tractably because the temporal decomposition for CVaR is history-dependent. Our primary theoretical contribution is to derive computationally tractable under-approximations to risk-sensitive safe sets. Our method provides a novel, theoretically guaranteed, parameter-dependent upper bound to the CVaR of a maximum cost without the need to augment the state space. For a fixed parameter value, the solution to only one Markov decision process problem is required to obtain the under-approximations for any family of risk-sensitivity levels. In addition, we propose a second definition for risk-sensitive safe sets and provide a tractable method for their estimation without using a parameter-dependent upper bound. The second definition is expressed in terms of a new coherent risk functional, which is inspired by CVaR. We demonstrate our primary theoretical contribution via numerical examples.	
 Learning Structural Edits via Incremental Tree Transformations	Ziyu Yao Frank Xu, Pengcheng YinThe Ohio State University Carnegie Mellon UniversityHuan Sun Graham NeubigThe Ohio State University Carnegie Mellon University	None	None	While most neural generative models generate outputs in a single pass, the human creative process is usually one of iterative building and refinement. Recent work has proposed models of editing processes, but these mostly focus on editing sequential data and/or only model a single editing pass. In this paper, we present a generic model for incremental editing of structured data ( i.e. ‚Äústructural edits‚Äù). Particularly, we focus on tree-structured data, taking abstract syntax trees of computer programs as our canonical example. Our editor learns to iteratively generate tree edits ( e.g. deleting or adding a subtree) and applies them to the partially edited data, thereby the entire editing process can be formulated as consecutive, incremental tree transformations. To show the unique benefits of modeling tree edits directly, we further propose a novel edit encoder for learning to represent edits, as well as an imitation learning method that allows the editor to be more robust. We evaluate our proposed editor on two source code edit datasets, where results show that, with the proposed edit encoder, our editor significantly improves accuracy over previous approaches that generate the edited program directly in one pass. Finally, we demonstrate that training our editor to imitate experts and correct its mistakes dynamically can further improve its performance.	
 Projection based model reduction for the immersed boundary method	Yushuang LuoDepartment of MathematicsThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA , USAXiantao LiDepartment of Mathematics,The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA , USAWenrui HaoDepartment of MathematicsThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA , USA	None	None	Fluid-structure interactions are central to many bio-molecular processes, and they impose a great challenge for computational and modeling methods. In this paper, we consider the immersed boundary method (IBM) for biofluid systems, and to alleviate the computational cost, we apply reduced-order techniques to eliminate the degrees of freedom associated with the large number of fluid variables. We show how reduced models can be derived using Petrov-Galerkin projection and subspaces that maintain the incompressibility condition. More importantly, the reduced-order model is shown to preserve the Lyapunov stability. We also address the practical issue of computing coefficient matrices in the reduced-order model using an interpolation technique. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed formulation are examined with test examples from various applications.	
 Eye: Program Visualizer for CS2	Aman Bansal, Preey Shah, Sahil Shah	aman0456b@gmail.com	None	In recent years, programming has witnessed a shift towards using standard libraries as a black box. However, there has not been a synchronous development of tools that can help demonstrate the working of such libraries in general programs, which poses an impediment to improved learning outcomes and makes debugging exasperating. In this paper, we present a tool Eye , which is an interactive visual interpreter that provides an intuitive representation of code execution and commonly used data structures in the C++ STL library. Eye provides a comprehensive overview at each stage during run time including the execution stack and the state of data structures. The modular implementation allows for extension to other languages and modification of the graphics as desired.	
 Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Based Power Allocation in a Massive MIMO Network	ManojdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Meysam Sadeghi, and Erik LarssondaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Deep learning (DL) is becoming popular as a new tool for many applications in wireless communication systems. However, for many classification tasks (e.g., modulation classification) it has been shown that DL-based wireless systems are susceptible to adversarial examples; adversarial examples are well-crafted malicious inputs to the neural network (NN) with the objective to cause erroneous outputs. In this paper, we extend this to regression problems and show that adversarial attacks can break DL-based power allocation in the downlink of a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (maMIMO) network. Specifically, we extend the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), momentum iterative FGSM, and projected gradient descent adversarial attacks in the context of power allocation in a maMIMO system. We benchmark the performance of these attacks and show that with a small perturbation in the input of the NN, the white-box attacks can result in infeasible solutions up to 86%. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of black-box attacks. All the evaluations conducted in this work are based on an open dataset and NN models, which are publicly available.	
 Performance Comparison between Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Relays: Theoretical Methods and a Perspective from Operator	Qi GudaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Dan WudaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Xin SudaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jing JindaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Yifei YuandaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Jiangzhou WangaststartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTdaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTFuture Mobile Technology Laboratory, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, ChinaaststartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTSchool of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent, Canterbury, UKEmaildaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTguqi, wudan, suxin, jinjing, yuanyifeichinamobilecom,aststartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTjzwangkentacuk	None	None	Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technique employing metasurface to reflect the signal from the source node to the destination node without consuming any energy. Not only the spectral efficiency but also the energy efficiency can be improved through RIS. Essentially, RIS can be considered as a passive relay between the source and destination node. On the other hand, a relay node in a traditional relay network has to be active, which indicates that it will consume energy when it is relaying the signal or information between the source and destination nodes. In this paper, we compare the performances between RIS and active relay for a general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. To make the comparison fair and comprehensive, both the performances of RIS and active relay are optimized with best-effort. In terms of the RIS, transmit beamforming and reflecting coefficient at the RIS are jointly optimized so as to maximize the end-to-end throughput. Although the optimization problem is non-convex, it is transformed equivalently to a weighted mean-square error (MSE) minimization problem and an alternating optimization problem is proposed, which can ensure the convergence to a stationary point. In terms of active relay, both half duplex relay (HDR) and full duplex relay (FDR) are considered. End-to-end throughput is maximized via an alternating optimization method. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, comparisons between RIS and relays are investigated from the perspective of system model, performance, deployment and controlling method.

 Modeling Context in Answer Sentence Selection Systems on a Latency Budget	Rujun HanUniversity of Southern CaliforniaLos Angeles, CA, USALuca SoldainiAmazon AlexaManhattan Beach, CA, USAAlessandro MoschittiAmazon AlexaManhattan Beach, CA, USA	None	None	Answer Sentence Selection ( AS2 ) is an efficient approach for the design of open-domain Question Answering (QA) systems. In order to achieve low latency, traditional AS2 models score question-answer pairs individually, ignoring any information from the document each potential answer was extracted from. In contrast, more computationally expensive models designed for machine reading comprehension tasks typically receive one or more passages as input, which often results in better accuracy. In this work, we present an approach to efficiently incorporate contextual information in AS2 models. For each answer candidate, we first use unsupervised similarity techniques to extract relevant sentences from its source document, which we then feed into an efficient transformer architecture fine-tuned for AS2 . Our best approach, which leverages a multi-way attention architecture to efficiently encode context, improves 6% to 11% over non-contextual state of the art in AS2 with minimal impact on system latency. All experiments in this work were conducted in English.	
 An Implementation of DF-GHG with Application to Spherical Black Hole Excision	Maitraya Bhattacharyya,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, David HilditchstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Rajesh Nayak,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Sarah RenkhoffstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Hannes RterstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Bernd BrgmannstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We present an implementation of the dual foliation generalized harmonic gauge (DF-GHG) formulation within the pseudospectral code bamps . The formalism promises to give greater freedom in the choice of coordinates that can be used in numerical relativity. As a specific application we focus here on the treatment of black holes in spherical symmetry. Existing approaches to black hole excision in numerical relativity are susceptible to failure if the boundary fails to remain outflow. We present a method, called DF-excision, to avoid this failure. Our approach relies on carefully choosing coordinates in which the coordinate lightspeeds are under strict control. These coordinates are then combined with the DF-GHG formulation. After performing a set of validation tests in a simple setting, we study the accretion of large pulses of scalar field matter on to a spherical black hole. We compare the results of DF-excision with a naive setup. DF-excision proves reliable even when the previous approach fails.

Measurements at such high precision crucially depend on the control of systematic effects. Here, we investigate how aberrations introduced by small optical imperfections along the path from the telescope to the detector affect the astrometry. We develop an analytical model that describes the impact of such aberrations on the measurement of complex visibilities. Our formalism accounts for pupil-plane and focal-plane aberrations, as well as for the interplay between static and turbulent aberrations, and successfully reproduces calibration measurements of a binary star. The Galactic Center observations with GRAVITY in 2017 and 2018, when both Sgr A* and the star S2 were targeted in a single fiber pointing, are affected by these aberrations at a level of less than 0.5 mas. Removal of these effects brings the measurement in harmony with the dual beam observations of 2019 and 2020, which are not affected by these aberrations. This also resolves the small systematic discrepancies between the derived distance R 0 subscript ùëÖ 0 R_{0} italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to the Galactic Center reported previously.	
 An Analysis Of Protected Health Information Leakage In Deep-Learning Based De-Identification Algorithms	Salman Seyedi,Li Xiong,Shamim Nemati,Gari Clifford,	None	None	The increasing complexity of algorithms for analyzing medical data, including de-identification tasks, raises the possibility that complex algorithms are learning not just the general representation of the problem, but specifics of given individuals within the data. Modern legal frameworks specifically prohibit the intentional or accidental distribution of patient data, but have not addressed this potential avenue for leakage of such protected health information. Modern deep learning algorithms have the highest potential of such leakage due to complexity of the models. Recent research in the field has highlighted such issues in non-medical data, but all analysis is likely to be data and algorithm specific. We, therefore, chose to analyze a state-of-the-art free-text de-identification algorithm based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and its potential in encoding any individual in the training set. Using the i2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the output of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be used to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used different attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the model. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of the training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model output. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into the identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not yet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.	
 Increasing the Confidence of Deep Neural Networks by Coverage Analysis	GiulioRossolini, AlessandroBiondi,,andGiorgioButtazzo	None	None	The great performance of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks in several perception and control tasks is pushing the industry to adopt such technologies in safety-critical applications, as autonomous robots and self-driving vehicles. At present, however, several issues need to be solved to make deep learning methods more trustworthy, predictable, safe, and secure against adversarial attacks. Although several methods have been proposed to improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples.	
 Potential Function-based Framework for Making the Gradients Small in Convex and Min-Max OptimizationThis research was partially supported by the NSF grant CCF-2007757 and by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Part of this research was done while PW was attending UW-Madison as part of the Visiting International Student Program (VISP).	Jelena DiakonikolasDepartment of Computer SciencesUniversity of WisconsinMadison, Puqian WangSchool of MathematicsShandong University	None	None	Making the gradients small is a fundamental optimization problem that has eluded unifying and simple convergence arguments in first-order optimization, so far primarily reserved for other convergence criteria, such as reducing the optimality gap. We introduce a novel potential function-based framework to study the convergence of standard methods for making the gradients small in smooth convex optimization and convex-concave min-max optimization. Our framework is intuitive and it provides a lens for viewing algorithms that make the gradients small as being driven by a trade-off between reducing either the gradient norm or a certain notion of an optimality gap. On the lower bounds side, we discuss tightness of the obtained convergence results for the convex setup and provide a new lower bound for minimizing norm of cocoercive operators that allows us to argue about optimality of methods in the min-max setup.	
 Domain Adaptation by Topology Regularization	Deborah Weeksa and Samuel RiverabaGeorge Washington University, Washington DC, USAbMatrix Research, Dayton, USA	None	None	Deep learning has become the leading approach to assisted target recognition. While these methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data, domain adaptation (DA) or transfer learning (TL) enables these algorithms to transfer knowledge from a labelled (source) data set to an unlabelled but related (target) data set of interest. DA enables networks to overcome the distribution mismatch between the source and target that leads to poor generalization in the target domain. DA techniques align these distributions by minimizing a divergence measurement between source and target, making the transfer of knowledge from source to target possible. While these algorithms have advanced significantly in recent years, most do not explicitly leverage global data manifold structure in aligning the source and target. We propose to leverage global data structure by applying a topological data analysis (TDA) technique called persistent homology to TL .	
 Bilinear control and growth of Sobolev norms for the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation	Alessandro Duca, VahagnNersesyan	None	None	We consider the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLS) on a torus of arbitrary dimension. The equation is studied in presence of an external potential field whose time-dependent amplitude is taken as control. Assuming that the potential satisfies a saturation property, we show that the NLS equation is approximately controllable between any pair of eigenstates in arbitrarily small time. The proof is obtained by developing a multiplicative version of a geometric control approach introduced by Agrachev and Sarychev. We give an application of this result to the study of the large time behavior of the NLS equation with random potential. More precisely, we assume that the amplitude of the potential is a random process whose law is 1 1 1 1 -periodic in time and non-degenerate. Combining the controllability with a stopping time argument and the Markov property, we show that the trajectories of the random equation are almost surely unbounded in regular Sobolev spaces.

 Compression-induced stiffness in the buckling of a one fiber composite	Lagrange	None	None	Abstract We study the buckling of a one fiber composite whose matrix stiffness is slightly dependent on the compressive force. We show that the equilibrium curves of the system exhibit a limit load when the induced stiffness parameter gets bigger than a threshold. This limit load increases when increasing the stiffness parameter and is related to a possible localized path in the post-buckling domain. Such a change in the maximum load may be very desirable from a structural stand point.

 Phase tipping: How cyclic ecosystems respond to contemporary climate	Hassan Alkhayuon, Rebecca Tyson, and Sebastian WieczorekstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We identify the phase of a cycle as a new critical factor for tipping points (critical transitions) in cyclic systems subject to time-varying external conditions. As an example, we consider how contemporary climate variability induces tipping from a predator-prey cycle to extinction in two paradigmatic predator-prey models with an Allee effect. Our analysis of these examples uncovers a counter-intuitive behaviour, which we call phase tipping or P-tipping , where tipping to extinction occurs only from certain phases of the cycle. To explain this behaviour, we combine global dynamics with set theory and introduce the concept of partial basin instability for attracting limit cycles. This concept provides a general framework to analyse and identify easily testable criteria for the occurrence of phase tipping in externally forced systems, and can be extended to more complicated attractors.	
 Hyperbolically symmetric static fluids: A general study	Herrera, Di Prisco, Ospino	lherrera@usal.es	None	We carry on a comprehensive study on static fluid distributions endowed with hyperbolical symmetry. Their physical properties are analyzed in detail. The energy density appears to be necessarily negative, which suggests that any possible application of this kind of fluids requires extreme physical conditions where quantum effects are expected to play an important role. Also, it is found that the fluid distribution cannot fill the region close to the center of symmetry. Such a region may be represented by a vacuum cavity around the center. A suitable definition of mass function, as well as the Tolman mass are explicitly calculated. While the former is positive defined, the latter is negative in most cases, revealing the repulsive nature of gravitational interaction. A general approach to obtain exact solutions is presented and some exact analytical solutions are exhibited.

 Classical resummation and breakdown of strong-field QED	THeinzl, AIlderton, BKing	thomas.heinzl@plymouth.ac.uk	None	QED perturbation theory has been conjectured to break down in sufficiently strong backgrounds, obstructing the analysis of strong-field physics. We show that the breakdown occurs even in classical electrodynamics, at lower field strengths than previously considered, and that it may be cured by resummation. As a consequence, an analogous resummation is required in QED. A detailed investigation shows, for a range of observables, that unitarity removes diagrams previously believed to be responsible for the breakdown of QED perturbation theory.	
 Strongly lensed cluster substructures are not in tension with ŒõCDM	Yannick BahstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTLeiden Observatory, Leiden University, PO Box , RA Leiden, The Netherlands	None	None	Strong gravitational lensing observations can test structure formation models by constraining the masses and concentrations of subhaloes in massive galaxy clusters. Recent work has concluded that cluster subhaloes are more abundant and/or concentrated than predicted by Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM simulations; this finding has been interpreted as arising from unidentified issues with simulations or an incorrect understanding of the nature of dark matter. We test these hypotheses by comparing observed subhalo masses and maximum circular velocities v max subscript ùë£ max v_{\mathrm{max}} italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_max end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to predictions from the high resolution Hydrangea galaxy cluster simulation suite, which is based on the successful EAGLE galaxy formation model. The simulated subhalo mass distribution and mass‚Äì v max subscript ùë£ max v_{\mathrm{max}} italic_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_max end_POSTSUBSCRIPT relation agrees well with observations, due to the presence of baryons during tidal stripping. Similar agreement is found for the lower-resolution Illustris-TNG300 simulation. In combination, our results suggest that the abundance and concentration of cluster substructures are not in tension with Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM, but may provide useful constraints for the refinement of baryon physics models in simulations.	
 Low Complexity Approximate Bayesian Logistic Regression for Sparse Online Learning	Gil ShamirGoogle Penn Ave Suite Wojciech SzpankowskiPurdue UniversityW Lafayette, IN	None	None	Theoretical results show that Bayesian methods can achieve lower bounds on regret for online logistic regression. In practice, however, such techniques may not be feasible especially for very large feature sets. Various approximations that, for huge sparse feature sets, diminish the theoretical advantages, must be used. Often, they apply stochastic gradient methods with hyper-parameters that must be tuned on some surrogate loss, defeating theoretical advantages of Bayesian methods. The surrogate loss, defined to approximate the mixture, requires techniques as Monte Carlo sampling, increasing computations per example. We propose low complexity analytical approximations for sparse online logistic and probit regressions. Unlike variational inference and other methods, our methods use analytical closed forms, substantially lowering computations. Unlike dense solutions, as Gaussian Mixtures, our methods allow for sparse problems with huge feature sets without increasing complexity. With the analytical closed forms, there is also no need for applying stochastic gradient methods on surrogate losses, and for tuning and balancing learning and regularization hyper-parameters. Empirical results top the performance of the more computationally involved methods. Like such methods, our methods still reveal per feature and per example uncertainty measures.	
 Prediction of new low-energy phases of BiFeO‚ÇÉ with large unit cell and complex tilts beyond Glazer notation	Bastien Grosso, Nicola Spaldin	bastien.grosso@mat.ethz.ch	None	Bismuth ferrite is one of the most widely studied multiferroic materials because of its large ferroelectric polarisation coexisting with magnetic order at room temperature. Using density functional theory (DFT), we identify several previously unknown polar and non-polar structures within the low-energy phase space of perovskite-structure bismuth ferrite, BiFeO 3 3 {}_{3} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT . Of particular interest is a series of non-centrosymmetric structures with polarisation along one lattice vector, combined with anti-polar distortions, reminiscent of ferroelectric domains, along a perpendicular direction. We discuss possible routes to stabilising the new phases using biaxial heteroepitaxial strain or interfacial electrostatic control in heterostructures.	
 Model-Based Policy Search Using Monte Carlo Gradient Estimation with Real Systems Application	Fabio AmadiostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alberto Dalla LiberastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Riccardo AntonellostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Daniel NikovskistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ruggero CarlistartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Diego RomeresstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this paper, we present a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) algorithm named Monte Carlo Probabilistic Inference for Learning COntrol (MC-PILCO). The algorithm relies on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and on a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the policy gradient. This defines a framework in which we ablate the choice of the following components: (i) the selection of the cost function, (ii) the optimization of policies using dropout, (iii) an improved data efficiency through the use of structured kernels in the GP models. The combination of the aforementioned aspects affects dramatically the performance of MC-PILCO. Numerical comparisons in a simulated cart-pole environment show that MC-PILCO exhibits better data efficiency and control performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art GP-based MBRL algorithms. Finally, we apply MC-PILCO to real systems, considering in particular systems with partially measurable states. We discuss the importance of modeling both the measurement system and the state estimators during policy optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions has been tested in simulation and on two real systems, a Furuta pendulum and a ball-and-plate rig. MC-PILCO code is publicly available at https://www.merl.com/research/license/MC-PILCO .

 Nuclear binding energy predictions using neural networks: Application of the multilayer perceptron	Esra Yksel, Derya Soydaner, Hseyin Bahtiyar	eyuksel@yildiz.edu.tr	None	In recent years, artificial neural networks and their applications for large data sets have became a crucial part of scientific research. In this work, we implement the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), to predict ground-state binding energies of atomic nuclei. Two different MLP architectures with three and four hidden layers are used to study their effects on the predictions. To train the MLP architectures, two different inputs are used along with the latest atomic mass table and changes in binding energy predictions are also analyzed in terms of the changes in the input channel. It is seen that using appropriate MLP architectures and putting more physical information in the input channels, MLP can make fast and reliable predictions for binding energies of atomic nuclei, which is also comparable to the microscopic energy density functionals.	
 Two-fluid hydrodynamics of cold atomic bosons under influence of the quantum fluctuations at non-zero temperatures	Pavel Andreev	andreevpa@physics.msu.ru	None	Ultracold Bose atoms is the physical system, where the quantum and nonlinear phenomena play crucial role. Ultracold bosons are considered at the small finite temperatures. Bosons are considered as two different fluids: Bose-Einstein condensate and normal fluid (the thermal component). An extended hydrodynamic model is obtained for both fluids, where the pressure evolution equations and the pressure flux third rank tensor evolution equations are considered along with the continuity and Euler equations. It is found that the pressure evolution equation contains zero contribution of the short-range interaction. The pressure flux evolution equation contains the interaction which gives the quantum fluctuations in the zero temperature limit. Here, we obtain its generalization for the finite temperature. The contribution of interaction in the pressure flux evolution equation which goes to zero in the zero temperature limit is found. The model is obtained via the straightforward derivation from the microscopic many-particle Schrodinger equation in the coordinate representation.

 An Optimal Control Strategy for Mathematically Modeling Cancer Combination Therapy	Dulles Math and Science AcademyPresented at the rdSystems Approaches to Cancer Biology ConferenceNovember th th,	None	None	While the use of combination therapy is increasing in prevalence for cancer treatment, it is often difficult to predict the exact interactions between different treatment forms, and their synergistic/antagonistic effects on patient health and therapy outcome. In this research, a system of ordinary differential equations is constructed to model nonlinear dynamics between tumor cells, immune cells, and three forms of therapy: chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy. This model is then used to generate optimized combination therapy plans using optimal control theory. In-silico experiments are conducted to simulate the response of the patient model to various treatment plans. This is the first mathematical model in current literature to introduce radiotherapy as an option alongside immuno- and chemotherapy, permitting more flexible and effective treatment plans that reflect modern therapeutic approaches.	
 On Mutual Information Analysis of Infectious Disease Transmission via Particle Propagation	PeterAdamHoeher, Martin Damrath, Sunasheer Bhattacharjee, and Max Schurwanz	None	None	Besides mimicking bio-chemical and multi-scale communication mechanisms, molecular communication forms a theoretical framework for virus infection processes. Towards this goal, aerosol and droplet transmission has recently been modeled as a multiuser scenario. In this letter, the ‚Äúinfection performance‚Äù is evaluated by means of a mutual information analysis, and by an even simpler probabilistic performance measure which is closely related to absorbed viruses. The so-called infection rate depends on the distribution of the channel input events as well as on the transition probabilities between channel input and output events. The infection rate is investigated analytically for five basic discrete memoryless channel models. Numerical results for the transition probabilities are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for pathogen-laden particle transmission in four typical indoor environments: two-person office, corridor, classroom, and bus. Particle transfer contributed significantly to infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza.

 Safety Verification of Parameterized Systems under Release-Acquire	Adwait Godbole, Shankara Narayanan Krishna, Roland Meyer	None	None	We study the safety verification problem for parameterized systems under the release-acquire (RA) semantics. It has been shown that the problem is intractable for systems with unlimited access to atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) instructions. We show that, from a verification perspective where approximate results help, this is overly pessimistic. We study parameterized systems consisting of an unbounded number of environment threads executing identical but CAS-free programs and a fixed number of distinguished threads that are unrestricted.	
 Private DNA Sequencing: Hiding Information in Discrete Noise	, Kayvon Mazooji, Roy Dong, Ilan Shomorony, 	None	None	When an individual‚Äôs DNA is sequenced, sensitive medical information becomes available to the sequencing laboratory. A recently proposed way to hide an individual‚Äôs genetic information is to mix in DNA samples of other individuals. We assume these samples are known to the individual but unknown to the sequencing laboratory. Thus, these DNA samples act as ‚Äúnoise‚Äù to the sequencing laboratory, but still allow the individual to recover their own DNA samples afterward. Motivated by this idea, we study the problem of hiding a binary random variable X ùëã X italic_X (a genetic marker) with the additive noise provided by mixing DNA samples, using mutual information as a privacy metric. This is equivalent to the problem of finding a worst-case noise distribution for recovering X ùëã X italic_X from the noisy observation among a set of feasible discrete distributions. We characterize upper and lower bounds to the solution of this problem, which are empirically shown to be very close. The lower bound is obtained through a convex relaxation of the original discrete optimization problem, and yields a closed-form expression. The upper bound is computed via a greedy algorithm for selecting the mixing proportions.

 tf.data: A Machine Learning Data Processing Framework	Derek GMurray, Ji ima, Ana Klimovic, Ihor Indyk	None	None	Training machine learning models requires feeding input data for models to ingest. Input pipelines for machine learning jobs are often challenging to implement efficiently as they require reading large volumes of data, applying complex transformations, and transferring data to hardware accelerators while overlapping computation and communication to achieve optimal performance. We present tf.data , a framework for building and executing efficient input pipelines for machine learning jobs. The tf.data API provides operators which can be parameterized with user-defined computation, composed, and reused across different machine learning domains. These abstractions allow users to focus on the application logic of data processing, while tf.data ‚Äôs runtime ensures that pipelines run efficiently.	
 Rubrics for Charge Conserving Current Mapping in Finite Element Particle in Cell Methods	Zane Crawford, Scott OConnor, John Luginsland, Shanker	None	None	Modeling of kinetic plasmas using electromagnetic particle in cell methods (EM-PIC) is a problem that is well worn, in that methods developed have been used extensively both understanding physics and exploiting them for device design. EM-PIC tools have largely relied on finite difference methods coupled with particle representations of the distribution function. Refinements to ensure consistency and charge conservation have largely been an ad-hoc efforts specific to finite difference methods. Meanwhile, solution methods for field solver have grown by leaps and bounds with significant performance metrics compared to finite difference methods. Developing new EM-PIC computational schemes that leverage modern field solver technology means re-examining analysis framework necessary for self-consistent EM-PIC solution. In this paper, we prescribe general rubrics for charge conservation, demonstrate how these are satisfied in conventional finite difference PIC as well as finite element PIC, and prescribe a novel charge conserving finite element PIC. Our effort leverages proper mappings on to de-Rham sequences and lays a groundwork for understanding conditions that must be satisfied for consistency. Several numerical results demonstrate the applicability of these rubrics.	
 Mapping the Supernovae Driven Winds of the Large Magellanic Cloud in Hùõº Emission I	Drew Ciampa, Kathleen Barger, Nicolas Lehner, Madeline Horn, Michael Hernandez, Matthew Haffner, Brianna Smart, Chad Bustard, Sam Barber, Henry Boot	None	None	We present the first spectroscopically resolved H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± emission map of the Large Magellanic Cloud‚Äôs (LMC) galactic wind. By combining new Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) observations ( I H Œ± ‚â≥ 10 mR greater-than-or-equivalent-to subscript ùêº H ùõº 10 mR I_{\rm H\alpha}\gtrsim 10~{}{\rm mR} italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_H italic_Œ± end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≥ 10 roman_mR ) with existing H i 21-cm emission observations, we have (1) mapped the LMC‚Äôs near-side galactic wind over a local standard of rest (LSR) velocity range of + 50 ‚â§ v LSR ‚â§ + 250 km s ‚àí 1 50 subscript v LSR 250 km superscript s 1 +50\leq\rm v_{LSR}\leq+250~{}{\rm km}~{}{\rm s}^{-1} + 50 ‚â§ roman_v start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_LSR end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â§ + 250 roman_km roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , (2) determined its morphology and extent, and (3) estimated its mass, outflow rate, and mass-loading factor. We observe H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± emission from this wind to typically 1-degree off the LMC‚Äôs H i disk. Kinematically, we find that the diffuse gas in the warm-ionized phase of this wind persists at both low ( ‚â≤ 100 km s ‚àí 1 less-than-or-similar-to absent 100 km superscript s 1 \lesssim 100~{}{\rm km}~{}{\rm s}^{-1} ‚â≤ 100 roman_km roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) and high ( ‚â≥ 100 km s ‚àí 1 greater-than-or-equivalent-to absent 100 km superscript s 1 \gtrsim 100~{}{\rm km}~{}{\rm s}^{-1} ‚â≥ 100 roman_km roman_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) velocities, relative to the LMC‚Äôs H i disk. Furthermore, we find that the high-velocity component spatially aligns with the most intense star-forming region, 30 Doradus. We, therefore, conclude that this high-velocity material traces an active outflow. We estimate the mass of the warm ( T e ‚âà 10 4 K subscript ùëá ùëí superscript 10 4 K T_{e}\approx 10^{4}~{}\rm K italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚âà 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_K ) ionized phase of the near-side LMC outflow to be log ‚Å° ( M ionized / M ‚äô ) = 7.51 ¬± 0.15 subscript ùëÄ ionized subscript ùëÄ direct-product plus-or-minus 7.51 0.15 \log{\left(M_{\rm ionized}/M_{\odot}\right)=7.51\pm 0.15} roman_log ( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_ionized end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = 7.51 ¬± 0.15 for the combined low and high velocity components. Assuming an ionization fraction of 75% and that the wind is symmetrical about the LMC disk, we estimate that its total (neutral and ionized) mass is log ‚Å° ( M total / M ‚äô ) = 7.93 subscript ùëÄ total subscript ùëÄ direct-product 7.93 \log{\left(M_{\rm total}/M_{\odot}\right)=7.93} roman_log ( italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_total end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = 7.93 , its mass-flow rate is M Àô outflow ‚âà 1.43 M ‚äô yr ‚àí 1 subscript Àô ùëÄ outflow 1.43 subscript ùëÄ direct-product superscript yr 1 \dot{M}_{\rm outflow}\approx 1.43~{}M_{\odot}~{}\rm yr^{-1} overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_outflow end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚âà 1.43 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_yr start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , and its mass-loading factor is Œ∑ ‚âà 4.54 ùúÇ 4.54 \eta\approx 4.54 italic_Œ∑ ‚âà 4.54 . Our average mass-loading factor results are roughly a factor of 2.5 larger than previous H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± imaging and UV absorption line studies, suggesting that those studies are missing nearly half the gas in the outflows.

using data from Advanced LIGO‚Äôs and Advanced Virgo‚Äôs third observing run (O3) combined with upper limits from the earlier O1 and O2 runs. Unlike in previous observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include Virgo in the search for the GWB. The results of the search are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and therefore we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the dimensionless energy density Œ© GW ‚â§ 5.8 √ó 10 ‚àí 9 subscript Œ© GW 5.8 superscript 10 9 \Omega_{\rm GW}\leq{\color[rgb]{0,0,0}5.8\times 10^{-9}} roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_GW end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â§ 5.8 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at the 95 % percent 95 95\% 95 % credible level for a flat (frequency-independent) GWB, using a prior which is uniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity coming from the band 20- 76.6 Hz; Œ© GW ( f ) ‚â§ 3.4 √ó 10 ‚àí 9 subscript Œ© GW ùëì 3.4 superscript 10 9 \Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\leq{\color[rgb]{0,0,0}3.4\times 10^{-9}} roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_GW end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_f ) ‚â§ 3.4 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 25 Hz for a power-law GWB with a spectral index of 2/3 (consistent with expectations for compact binary coalescences), in the band 20- 90.6 Hz; and Œ© GW ( f ) ‚â§ 3.9 √ó 10 ‚àí 10 subscript Œ© GW ùëì 3.9 superscript 10 10 \Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\leq{\color[rgb]{0,0,0}3.9\times 10^{-10}} roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_GW end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_f ) ‚â§ 3.9 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20- 291.6 Hz. These upper limits improve over our previous results by a factor of 6.0 for a flat GWB, 8.8 for a spectral index of 2/3, and 13.1 for a spectral index of 3. We also search for a GWB arising from scalar and vector modes, which are predicted by alternative theories of gravity; we do not find evidence of these, and place upper limits on the strength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no evidence of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian analysis that allows for the presence of both a GWB and an effective magnetic background arising from geophysical Schumann resonances. We compare our upper limits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries, updating the model to use the most recent data-driven population inference from the systems detected during O3a. Finally, we combine our results with observations of individual mergers and show that, at design sensitivity, this joint approach may yield stronger constraints on the merger rate of binary black holes at z ‚â≥ 2 greater-than-or-equivalent-to ùëß 2 z\gtrsim 2 italic_z ‚â≥ 2 than can be achieved with individually resolved mergers alone.

 Solution methods for the growth of a repeating imperfection in the line of a strut on a nonlinear foundation	Lagrange, Averbuch, Lagrange, Averbuch	romain.g.lagrange@gmail.com	IFP √ânergies nouvelles, Rond-point de l‚Äô√©changeur de Solaize, BP3, 69360 Solaize, France	This paper is a theoretical and numerical study of the uniform growth of a repeating sinusoidal imperfection in the line of a strut on a nonlinear elastic Winkler type foundation. The imperfection is introduced by considering an initially deformed shape which is a sine function with an half wavelength. The restoring force is either a bi-linear or an exponential profile. Periodic solutions of the equilibrium problem are found using three different approaches: a semi-analytical method, an explicit solution of a Galerkin method and a direct numerical resolution. These methods are found in very good agreement and show the existence of a maximum imperfection size which leads to a limit point in the equilibrium curve of the system. The existence of this limit point is very important since it governs the appearance of localization phenomena.	
 A Semimicroscopic Algebraic Cluster Model for Heavy Nuclei	Peter Hess, Leonardo ChvezNuez	None	None	An extension of the Semimicroscopic Algebraic Cluster Model (SACM) is proposed, based on the pseudo- S U ( 3 ) ùëÜ ùëà 3 SU(3) italic_S italic_U ( 3 ) model ( S U ~ ( 3 ) ~ ùëÜ ùëà 3 \widetilde{SU}(3) over~ start_ARG italic_S italic_U end_ARG ( 3 ) ). The Hamiltonian and the spectroscopic factor operator of the model are presented and a procedure of constructing the model space. Because a huge number of S U ( 3 ) ùëÜ ùëà 3 SU(3) italic_S italic_U ( 3 ) irreducible representations (irrep) appear, one has to be careful in designing a practical, consistent path to reduce the Hilbert space.

 A modified in-medium evolution equation with color coherence	Joo Barata, Fabio Domnguez, Carlos Salgado, Vctor Vila	None	None	QCD jets produced in heavy-ion collisions at LHC or RHIC energies partially evolve inside the produced hot and dense quark gluon plasma, offering unique opportunities to study QCD splitting processes in different backgrounds. Induced (modified) splittings are expected to be the most relevant mechanism driving the modifications of in-medium jets compared to vacuum jets for a wide sets of observables. Although color coherence among different emitters has been identified as an essential mechanism in studies of the QCD antenna radiation , it is usually neglected in the multi-gluon medium-induced cascade. This independent gluon emission approximation can be analytically proved to be valid in the limit of very large media, but corrections or modifications to it have not been computed before in the context of the evolution (or rate) equation describing the gluon cascade. We propose a modified evolution equation that includes corrections due to the interference of subsequent emitters. In order to do so, we first compute a modified splitting kernel following the usual procedure of factorizing it from the subsequent Brownian motion. The calculation is performed in the two-gluon configuration with no overlapping formation times, that is expected to provide the first correction to the completely independent picture.	
 Self-Attention Meta-Learner for Continual Learning	Ghada Sokar, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Mykola Pechenizkiy	g.a.z.n.sokar@tue.nl	None	Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents capable of learning multiple tasks sequentially with neural networks. One of its main challenging, catastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability to learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current approaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is optimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the learned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks uses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge might not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks, especially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM) 1 1 1 Our code is available at https://github.com/GhadaSokar/Self-Attention-Meta-Learner-for-Continual-Learning , which learns a prior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention mechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each future task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the selected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the task agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better performance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by building on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the role of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features corresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task agnostic inference. Finally, we demonstrate that popular existing continual learning methods gain a performance boost when they adopt SAM as a starting point.

 Exactly solvable spin-1/2 XYZ models with highly-degenerate, partially ordered, ground states	Grgur Palle, Owen Benton	None	None	Exactly solvable models play a special role in Condensed Matter physics, serving as secure theoretical starting points for investigation of new phenomena. Changlani et al . [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 , 117202 (2018) ] have discovered a limit of the XXZ model for S = 1 / 2 ùëÜ 1 2 S=1/2 italic_S = 1 / 2 spins on the kagome lattice, which is not only exactly solvable, but features a huge degeneracy of exact ground states corresponding to solutions of a three-coloring problem. This special point of the model was proposed as a parent for multiple phases in the wider phase diagram, including quantum spin liquids. Here, we show that the construction of Changlani et al . can be extended to more general forms of anisotropic exchange interaction, finding a line of parameter space in an XYZ model which maintains both the macroscopic degeneracy and the three-coloring structure of solutions. We show that the ground states along this line are partially ordered, in the sense that infinite-range correlations of some spin components coexist with a macroscopic number of undetermined degrees of freedom. We therefore propose the exactly solvable limit of the XYZ model on corner-sharing triangle-based lattices as a tractable starting point for discovery of quantum spin systems which mix ordered and spin liquid-like properties.	
 New notions of simultaneous diagonalizability of quadratic forms with applications to QCQPs	Alex LWang, Rujun Jiang	None	None	A set of quadratic forms is simultaneously diagonalizable via congruence (SDC) if there exists a basis under which each of the quadratic forms is diagonal. This property appears naturally when analyzing quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) and has important implications in this context. This paper extends the reach of the SDC property by studying two new related but weaker notions of simultaneous diagonalizability. Specifically, we say that a set of quadratic forms is almost SDC (ASDC) if it is the limit of SDC sets and d ùëë d italic_d -restricted SDC ( d ùëë d italic_d -RSDC) if it is the restriction of an SDC set in up to d ùëë d italic_d -many additional dimensions. Our main contributions are a complete characterization of the ASDC pairs and the nonsingular ASDC triples, as well as a sufficient condition for the 1 1 1 1 -RSDC property for pairs of quadratic forms. Surprisingly, we show that every singular pair is ASDC and that almost every pair is 1 1 1 1 -RSDC.

 Theory of heterogeneous circuits with stochastic memristive devices	Valeriy Slipko, Yuriy Pershin	vslipko@uni.opole.pl	None	We introduce an approach based on the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation to model heterogeneous stochastic circuits, namely, the circuits combining binary or multi-state stochastic memristive devices and continuum reactive components (capacitors and/or inductors). Such circuits are described in terms of occupation probabilities of memristive states that are functions of reactive variables. As an illustrative example, the series circuit of a binary memristor and capacitor is considered in detail. Some analytical solutions are found. Our work offers a novel analytical/numerical tool for modeling complex stochastic networks, which may find a broad range of applications.

One may also extend this to complex-valued functions, once H ùêª H italic_H is paired with a 2 2 2 2 -edge-colouring Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± to assign conjugates.

 Low-complexity Rank-Efficient Tensor Completion For Prediction And Online Wireless Edge CachingAuthors are with Institute of digital communications, School of engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, EH9 3FG. Emails: {ngarg, t.ratnarajah}@ed.ac.uk.	Navneet Garg, , and Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	None	None	Wireless edge caching is a popular strategy to avoid backhaul congestion in the next generation networks, where the content is cached in advance at base stations to serve redundant requests during peak congestion periods. In the edge caching data, the missing observations are inevitable due to dynamic selective popularity. Among the completion methods, the tensor-based models have been shown to be the most advantageous for missing data imputation. Also, since the observations are correlated across time, files, and base stations, in this paper, we formulate the cooperative caching with recommendations as a fourth-order tensor completion and prediction problem. Since the content library can be large leading to a large dimension tensor, we modify the latent norm-based Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm with towards a much lower time complexity using multi-rank updates, rather than rank-1 updates in literature. This significantly lower time computational overhead leads in developing an online caching algorithm. With MovieLens dataset, simulations show lower reconstruction errors for the proposed algorithm as compared to that of the recent FW algorithm, albeit with lower computation overhead. It is also demonstrated that the completed tensor improves normalized cache hit rates for linear prediction schemes.	
 Two-color differential dynamic microscopy for capturing fast dynamics	You, McGorty	None	None	Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) is increasingly used in the fields of soft matter physics and biophysics to extract the dynamics of microscopic objects across a range of wavevectors using optical microscopy. Standard DDM is limited to detecting dynamics no faster than the camera frame rate. We report on an extension to DDM where we sequentially illuminate the sample with spectrally-distinct light and image with a color camera. By pulsing blue and then red light separated by a lag time much smaller than the camera‚Äôs exposure time we are able to use this two-color DDM method to measure dynamics occurring much faster than the camera frame rate. The following article has been accepted by Review of Scientific Instruments. After it is published, it will be found at https://aip.scitation.org/journal/rsi .	
 The Critical Locus and Rigidity of Foliations of Complex H√©non Maps	Misha Lyubich and John Robertson	None	None	We study H√©non maps which are perturbations of a hyperbolic polynomial p ùëù p italic_p with connected Julia set. We give a complete description of the critical locus of these maps. In particular, we show that for each critical point c ùëê c italic_c of p ùëù p italic_p , there is a primary component of the critical locus asymptotic to the line y = c ùë¶ ùëê y=c italic_y = italic_c . Moreover, primary components are conformally equivalent to the punctured disk, and their orbits cover the whole critical set. We also describe the holonomy maps from such a component to itself along the leaves of two natural foliations. Finally, we show that a quadratic H√©non map taken along with the natural pair of foliations, is a rigid object, in the sense that a conjugacy between two such maps respecting the foliations is a holomorphic or antiholomorphic affine map.

 The Agnostic Structure of Data Science Methods	Domenico Napoletani, Marco Panza, Daniele Struppa	None	None	In this paper we argue that data science is a coherent and novel approach to empirical problems that, in its most general form, does not build understanding about phenomena. Within the new type of mathematization at work in data science, mathematical methods are not selected because of any relevance for a problem at hand; mathematical methods are applied to a specific problem only by ‚Äòforcing‚Äô, i.e. on the basis of their ability to reorganize the data for further analysis and the intrinsic richness of their mathematical structure. In particular, we argue that deep learning neural networks are best understood within the context of forcing optimization methods. We finally explore the broader question of the appropriateness of data science methods in solving problems. We argue that this question should not be interpreted as a search for a correspondence between phenomena and specific solutions found by data science methods; rather, it is the internal structure of data science methods that is open to precise forms of understanding.

 A Survey on Personality-Aware Recommendation Systems	Sahraoui Dhelim, Nyothiri Aung, Mohammed Amine Bouras, Huansheng Ning and Erik Cambria	None	None	With the emergence of personality computing as a new research field related to artificial intelligence and personality psychology, we have witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of personality-aware recommendation systems. Unlike conventional recommendation systems, these new systems solve traditional problems such as the cold start and data sparsity problems. This survey aims to study and systematically classify personality-aware recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first that focuses on personality-aware recommendation systems. We explore the different design choices of personality-aware recommendation systems, by comparing their personality modeling methods, as well as their recommendation techniques. Furthermore, we present the commonly used datasets and point out some of the challenges of personality-aware recommendation systems.	
 Reinforcement Learning based Per-antenna Discrete Power Control for Massive MIMO SystemsThe work was supported by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Grants EP/P009549/1 and EP/P009670/1.	Navneet Garg, Mathini SellathuraidaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tharmalingam RatnarajahThe University of Edinburgh, UK,daggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTHeriotWatt university,Edinburgh, UK	None	None	Power consumption is one of the major issues in massive MIMO (multiple input multiple output) systems, causing increased long-term operational cost and overheating issues. In this paper, we consider per-antenna power allocation with a given finite set of power levels towards maximizing the long-term energy efficiency of the multi-user systems, while satisfying the QoS (quality of service) constraints at the end users in terms of required SINRs (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio), which depends on channel information. Assuming channel states to vary as a Markov process, the constraint problem is modeled as an unconstraint problem, followed by the power allocation based on Q ùëÑ Q italic_Q -learning algorithm. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the successful minimization of power consumption while achieving the SINR threshold at users.	
 Double Field Theory and Geometric Quantisation	Luigi Alfonsi, and David Berman	None	None	"We examine various properties of double field theory and the doubled string sigma model in the context of geometric quantisation. In particular we look at T-duality as the symplectic transformation related to an alternative choice of polarisation in the construction of the quantum bundle for the string. Following this perspective we adopt a variety of techniques from geometric quantisation to study the doubled space. One application is the construction of the ""double coherent state"" that provides the shortest distance in any duality frame and a ""stringy deformed"" Fourier transform."	
 Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for agent-based models of disease transmission	Nianqiao Ju, Jeremy Heng, Pierre Jacob	None	None	Agent-based models of disease transmission involve stochastic rules that specify how a number of individuals would infect one another, recover or be removed from the population. Common yet stringent assumptions stipulate interchangeability of agents and that all pairwise contact are equally likely. Under these assumptions, the population can be summarized by counting the number of susceptible and infected individuals, which greatly facilitates statistical inference. We consider the task of inference without such simplifying assumptions, in which case, the population cannot be summarized by low-dimensional counts. We design improved particle filters, where each particle corresponds to a specific configuration of the population of agents, that take either the next or all future observations into account when proposing population configurations. Using simulated data sets, we illustrate that orders of magnitude improvements are possible over bootstrap particle filters. We also provide theoretical support for the approximations employed to make the algorithms practical.

 Discriminative Appearance Modeling with Multi-track Pooling for Real-time Multi-object Tracking	Chanho Kim,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTLi Fuxin,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTMazen Alotaibi,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTJames Rehg,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTGeorgia Institute of TechnologystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTOregon State University	None	None	In multi-object tracking, the tracker maintains in its memory the appearance and motion information for each object in the scene. This memory is utilized for finding matches between tracks and detections and is updated based on the matching result. Many approaches model each target in isolation and lack the ability to use all the targets in the scene to jointly update the memory. This can be problematic when there are similar looking objects in the scene. In this paper, we solve the problem of simultaneously considering all tracks during memory updating, with only a small spatial overhead, via a novel multi-track pooling module. We additionally propose a training strategy adapted to multi-track pooling which generates hard tracking episodes online. We show that the combination of these innovations results in a strong discriminative appearance model, enabling the use of greedy data association to achieve online tracking performance. Our experiments demonstrate real-time, state-of-the-art performance on public multi-object tracking (MOT) datasets. The code and trained models will be released at https://github.com/chkim403/blstm-mtp .	
 Online Capacity Scaling Augmented With Unreliable Machine Learning Predictions	Daan Rutten, Debankur Mukherjee	None	None	Modern data centers suffer from immense power consumption. As a result, data center operators have heavily invested in capacity scaling solutions, which dynamically deactivate servers if the demand is low and activate them again when the workload increases. We analyze a continuous-time model for capacity scaling, where the goal is to minimize the weighted sum of flow-time, switching cost, and power consumption in an online fashion. We propose a novel algorithm, called Adaptive Balanced Capacity Scaling (ABCS), that has access to black-box machine learning predictions. ABCS aims to adapt to the predictions and is also robust against unpredictable surges in the workload.

Finally, we investigate the performance of this algorithm on a real-world dataset and carry out extensive numerical experiments, which positively support the theoretical results.	
 Improved Rate-Energy Trade-off For SWIPT Using Chordal Distance Decomposition In Interference Alignment Networks	Navneet Garg,Avinash Rudraksh, Govind Sharma, Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	None	None	This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) precoding scheme for K-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels (IC), for which interference alignment (IA) schemes provide optimal precoders to achieve full degrees-of-freedom (DoF) gain. However, harvesting RF energy simultaneously reduces the achievable DoFs. To study a trade-off between harvested energy and sum rate, the transceiver design problem is suboptimally formulated in literature via convex relaxations, which is still computationally intensive, especially for battery limited nodes running on harvested energy. In this paper, we propose a systematic method using chordal distance (CD) decomposition to obtain the balanced precoding, which improves the trade-off. Analysis shows that given the nonnegative value of CD, the achieved harvested energy for the proposed precoder is higher than that for perfect IA precoder. Moreover, energy constraints can be achieved, while maintaining a constant rate loss without losing DoFs via tuning the CD value and splitting factor. Simulation results verify the analysis and add that the IA schemes based on max-SINR or mean-squared error are better suited for SWIPT maximization than subspace or leakage minimization methods.	
 The taut polynomial and the Alexander polynomial	Anna Parlak	anna.parlak@gmail.com	Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom	Landry, Minsky and Taylor defined the taut polynomial of a veering triangulation. Its specialisations generalise the Teichm√ºller polynomial of a fibred face of the Thurston norm ball. We prove that the taut polynomial of a veering triangulation is equal to a certain twisted Alexander polynomial of the underlying manifold. Then we give formulas relating the taut polynomial and the untwisted Alexander polynomial. There are two formulas; one holds when the maximal free abelian cover of a veering triangulation is edge-orientable, another holds when it is not edge-orientable.

The cluster hosts one of the largest giant radio halos which are observed in most of the merging clusters, and a candidate radio relic. Recently, three merger shock fronts were detected in this cluster, explaining its extreme temperature and complex structure. Furthermore, previous XMM-Newton and Chandra observations hinted at the presence of a shock front that is associated with the gas ‚Äòbullet‚Äô crossing the main cluster in the west-ward direction, and which heated the intra-cluster medium, leading to adiabatic compression of the gas behind the ‚Äôbullet‚Äô. The goal of this paper is to report on the detection of this shock front as revealed by the temperature discontinuity in the X-ray XMM-Newton image, and the edge in the Very Large Array (VLA) radio image. We also report on the detection of a relic source in the north-eastern region of the radio halo in the KAT-7 data, confirming the presence of an extended relic in this cluster.

 Two-level Nystr√∂m‚ÄìSchur Preconditioner for Sparse Symmetric Positive Definite MatricesSubmitted to the editors January 28, 2021.	Hussam Al Daas, Tyrone Rees, Jennifer Scott	hussam.al-daas@stfc.ac.uk	None	Randomized methods are becoming increasingly popular in numerical linear algebra. However, few attempts have been made to use them in developing preconditioners. Our interest lies in solving large-scale sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems of equations where the system matrix is preordered to doubly bordered block diagonal form (for example, using a nested dissection ordering). We investigate the use of randomized methods to construct high quality preconditioners. In particular, we propose a new and efficient approach that employs Nystr√∂m‚Äôs method for computing low rank approximations to develop robust algebraic two-level preconditioners. Construction of the new preconditioners involves iteratively solving a smaller but denser symmetric positive definite Schur complement system with multiple right-hand sides. Numerical experiments on problems coming from a range of application areas demonstrate that this inner system can be solved cheaply using block conjugate gradients and that using a large convergence tolerance to limit the cost does not adversely affect the quality of the resulting Nystr√∂m‚ÄìSchur two-level preconditioner.

We address, in particular, a characterization of such curves of minimal class and show that all realizations of these curves are essentially equivalent and can be described in terms of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC), also known as Szeg≈ë polynomials. Our results have connections to classical results from algebraic and projective geometry, such as theorems of Poncelet, Darboux, and Kippenhahn; numerical ranges of a class of matrices; and Blaschke products and disk functions.	
 Pythagorean Triples, Complex Numbers, Abelian Groups and Prime Numbers	Amnon Yekutieli	amyekut@math.bgu.ac.il	"Department of Mathematics,
Ben Gurion University, Be‚Äôer Sheva 84105, Israel"	It is well-known that pythagorean triples can be represented by points of the unit circle with rational coordinates. These points form an abelian group, and we describe its structure. This structural description yields, almost immediately, an enumeration of the normalized pythagorean triples with a given hypotenuse, and also to an effective method for producing all such triples. This effective method seems to be new.

We compare the behaviours of molten chocolate and Carbopol which are both shear-thinning with a similar yield stress but exhibit very different elastic properties. We find that these materials spread when the forcing acceleration exceeds a threshold which is determined by the initial deposition process. However, they exhibit very different spreading behaviours: whereas chocolate exhibits slow long-term spreading, the Carbopol drop rapidly relaxes its stress by spreading to a new equilibrium shape with an enlarged footprint. This spreading is insensitive to the history of the forcing. In addition, the Carbopol drop performs large-amplitude oscillations with the forcing frequency, both above and below the threshold. We investigate these viscoelastic oscillations and provide evidence of complex nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour in the vicinity of the spreading threshold. In fact, for forcing accelerations greater than the spreading threshold, our drop automatically adjusts its shape to remain at the yield stress. We discuss how our vibrated-drop experiment offers a new and powerful approach to probing the yield transition in elastoviscoplastic fluids.	
 Rate-Energy Balanced Precoding Design for SWIPT based Two-Way Relay Systems	Navneet Garg, Junkai Zhang, and Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	None	None	Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique is a popular strategy to convey both information and RF energy for harvesting at receivers. In this regard, we consider a two-way relay system with multiple users and a multi-antenna relay employing SWIPT strategy, where splitting the received signal leads to a rate-energy trade-off. In literature, the works on transceiver design have been studied using computationally intensive and suboptimal convex relaxation based schemes. In this paper, we study the balanced precoder design using chordal distance (CD) decomposition, which incurs much lower complexity, and is flexible to dynamic energy requirements. It is analyzed that given a non-negative value of CD, the achieved harvested energy for the proposed balanced precoder is higher than that for the perfect interference alignment (IA) precoder. The corresponding loss in sum rates is also analyzed via an upper bound. Simulation results add that the IA schemes based on mean-squared error are better suited for the SWIPT maximization than the subspace alignment-based methods.

 Optimal cost tuning of frustration: Achieving desired states in the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model	Gemma RosellTarrag, Albert DazGuilera	gemmaroselltarrago@gmail.com	None	There are numerous examples of studied real-world systems that can be described as dynamical systems characterized by individual phases and coupled in a network like structure. Within the framework of oscillatory models, much attention has been devoted to the Kuramoto model, which considers a collection of oscillators interacting through a sinus function of the phase differences. In this paper, we draw on an extension of the Kuramoto model, called the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model, which adds a phase lag parameter to each node. We construct a general formalism that allows to compute the set of lag parameters that may lead to any phase configuration within a linear approximation. In particular, we devote special attention to the cases of full synchronization and symmetric configurations. We show that the set of natural frequencies, phase lag parameters and phases at the steady state is coupled by an equation and a continuous spectra of solutions is feasible. In order to quantify the system‚Äôs strain to achieve that particular configuration, we define a cost function and compute the optimal set of parameters that minimizes it. Despite considering a linear approximation of the model, we show that the obtained tuned parameters for the case of full synchronization enhance frequency synchronization in the nonlinear model as well.	
 Vortex propagation and phase transitions in a chiral antiferromagnetic nanostripe	Riccardo Tomasello, Stavros Komineas	None	None	We study a vortex in a nanostripe of an antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy and interfacial Dzyloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The vortex has hybrid chirality being N√©el close to its center and Bloch away from it. Propagating vortices can acquire velocities up to a maximum value that is lower than the spin wave velocity. When the vortex is forced to exceed the maximum velocity, phase transitions occur to a nonflat spiral, vortex chain, and flat spiral, successively. The vortex chain is a topological configuration stabilised in the stripe geometry. Theoretical arguments lead to the general result that the velocity of localized excitations in chiral magnets cannot reach the spin wave velocity.	
 Entanglement-assisted capacity regions and protocol designs for quantum multiple-access channels	Haowei Shi, MinHsiu Hsieh, Saikat Guha, Zheshen Zhang, Quntao Zhuang	None	None	We solve the entanglement-assisted (EA) classical capacity region of quantum multiple-access channels with an arbitrary number of senders. As an example, we consider the bosonic thermal-loss multiple-access channel and solve the one-shot capacity region enabled by an entanglement source composed of sender-receiver pairwise two-mode squeezed vacuum states. The EA capacity region is strictly larger than the capacity region without entanglement-assistance. With two-mode squeezed vacuum states as the source and phase modulation as the encoding, we also design practical receiver protocols to realize the entanglement advantages. Four practical receiver designs, based on optical parametric amplifiers, are given and analyzed. In the parameter region of a large noise background, the receivers can enable a simultaneous rate advantage of 82.0 % percent 82.0 82.0\% 82.0 % for each sender. Due to teleportation and superdense coding, our results for EA classical communication can be directly extended to EA quantum communication at half of the rates. Our work provides a unique and practical network communication scenario where entanglement can be beneficial.

 LOME: Large Ontology Multilingual Extraction	Patrick Xia, Guanghui Qin, Siddharth VashishthaJohns Hopkins University,University of Rochester	None	None	We present LOME, a system for performing multilingual information extraction. Given a text document as input, our core system identifies spans of textual entity and event mentions with a FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998 ) parser. It subsequently performs coreference resolution, fine-grained entity typing, and temporal relation prediction between events. By doing so, the system constructs an event and entity focused knowledge graph. We can further apply third-party modules for other types of annotation, like relation extraction. Our (multilingual) first-party modules either outperform or are competitive with the (monolingual) state-of-the-art. We achieve this through the use of multilingual encoders like XLM-R Conneau et al. ( 2020 ) and leveraging multilingual training data. LOME is available as a Docker container on Docker Hub. In addition, a lightweight version of the system is accessible as a web demo.	
 On the Origin of Implicit Regularization in Stochastic Gradient Descent	Samuel SmithstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Benoit DherinstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, David BarrettstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Soham DestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTDeepMind,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTGoogle	None	None	For infinitesimal learning rates, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) follows the path of gradient flow on the full batch loss function. However moderately large learning rates can achieve higher test accuracies, and this generalization benefit is not explained by convergence bounds, since the learning rate which maximizes test accuracy is often larger than the learning rate which minimizes training loss. To interpret this phenomenon we prove that for SGD with random shuffling, the mean SGD iterate also stays close to the path of gradient flow if the learning rate is small and finite, but on a modified loss . This modified loss is composed of the original loss function and an implicit regularizer, which penalizes the norms of the minibatch gradients. Under mild assumptions, when the batch size is small the scale of the implicit regularization term is proportional to the ratio of the learning rate to the batch size. We verify empirically that explicitly including the implicit regularizer in the loss can enhance the test accuracy when the learning rate is small.

 Homological mirror symmetry for nodal stacky curves	Matthew Habermann	matthew.habermann@uni-hamburg.de	None	In this paper, we establish homological mirror symmetry where the A-model is a finite quotient of the Milnor fibre of an invertible curve singularity, proving a conjecture of Lekili and Ueda from [ LU22 ] in this dimension. Our strategy is to view the B‚Äìmodel as a cycle of stacky projective lines and generalise the strategy of Lekili and Polishchuk in [ LP17 ] to allow the irreducible components of the curve to have non-trivial generic stabiliser, a result which might also be of independent interest. We then prove that the A‚Äìmodel which results from this strategy is graded symplectomorphic to the corresponding quotient of the Milnor fibre.	
 L√©vy Adaptive B-spline Regression via Overcomplete Systems	Sewon Park, HeeSeok Oh, Jaeyong Lee	None	None	The estimation of functions with varying degrees of smoothness is a challenging problem in the nonparametric function estimation. In this paper, we propose the LABS (L√©vy Adaptive B-Spline regression) model, an extension of the LARK models, for the estimation of functions with varying degrees of smoothness. LABS model is a LARK with B-spline bases as generating kernels. The B-spline basis consists of piecewise k ùëò k italic_k degree polynomials with k ‚àí 1 ùëò 1 k-1 italic_k - 1 continuous derivatives and can express systematically functions with varying degrees of smoothness. By changing the orders of the B-spline basis, LABS can systematically adapt the smoothness of functions, i.e., jump discontinuities, sharp peaks, etc. Results of simulation studies and real data examples support that this model catches not only smooth areas but also jumps and sharp peaks of functions. The proposed model also has the best performance in almost all examples. Finally, we provide theoretical results that the mean function for the LABS model belongs to the certain Besov spaces based on the orders of the B-spline basis and that the prior of the model has the full support on the Besov spaces.

 Diagonalization of Hamiltonian for finite-sized dispersive media: Canonical quantization with numerical mode-decomposition (CQ-NMD)	DongYeop Na, Jie Zhu, Weng Chew	None	None	We present a new math-physics modeling approach, called canonical quantization with numerical mode-decomposition , for capturing the physics of how incoming photons interact with finite-sized dispersive media, which is not describable by the previous Fano-diagonalization methods. The main procedure is to (1) study a system where electromagnetic (EM) fields are coupled to non-uniformly-distributed Lorentz oscillators in Hamiltonian mechanics, (2) derive a generalized Hermitian eigenvalue problem for conjugate pairs in coordinate space, (3) apply computational electromagnetics methods to find a countably-finite set of time-harmonic eigenmodes that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian, and (4) perform the subsequent canonical quantization with mode-decomposition. Moreover, we provide several numerical simulations that capture the physics of full quantum effects, impossible by classical Maxwell‚Äôs equations, such as non-local dispersion cancellation of an entangled photon pair and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect in a dispersive beam splitter.

 Emergent gauge symmetries: Yang-Mills theory	Carlos Barcel, Ral CarballoRubio, Luis Garay, Gerardo GarcaMoreno	carlos@iaa.es	None	Gauge symmetries remove unphysical states and guarantee that field theories are free from the pathologies associated with these states. In this work we find a set of general conditions that guarantee the removal of unphysical states in field theories describing interacting vector fields. These conditions are obtained through the extension of a mechanism for the emergence of gauge symmetries proposed in a previous article [C. Barcel√≥ et al. JHEP 10 (2016) 084] in order to account for non-Abelian gauge symmetries, and are the following: low-energy Lorentz invariance, emergence of massless vector fields describable by an action quadratic in those fields and their derivatives, and self-coupling to a conserved current associated with specific rigid symmetries. Using a bootstrapping procedure, we prove that these conditions are equivalent to the emergence of gauge symmetries and, therefore, guarantee that any theory satisfying them must be equivalent to a Yang-Mills theory at low energies.

 Practical distributed quantum information processing with LOCCNet	Xuanqiang Zhao, Benchi Zhao, Zihe Wang, Zhixin Song, Xin Wang	None	None	Distributed quantum information processing is essential for building quantum networks and enabling more extensive quantum computations. In this regime, several spatially separated parties share a multipartite quantum system, and the most natural set of operations is Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). As a pivotal part in quantum information theory and practice, LOCC has led to many vital protocols such as quantum teleportation. However, designing practical LOCC protocols is challenging due to LOCC‚Äôs intractable structure and limitations set by near-term quantum devices. Here we introduce LOCCNet, a machine learning framework facilitating protocol design and optimization for distributed quantum information processing tasks. As applications, we explore various quantum information tasks such as entanglement distillation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum channel simulation. We discover protocols with evident improvements, in particular, for entanglement distillation with quantum states of interest in quantum information. Our approach opens up new opportunities for exploring entanglement and its applications with machine learning, which will potentially sharpen our understanding of the power and limitations of LOCC. An implementation of LOCCNet is available in Paddle Quantum, a quantum machine learning Python package based on PaddlePaddle deep learning platform.	
 Computer simulation of surgical interventions for the treatment of refractory pulmonary hypertension	Seong Woo Han, Charles Puelz, Craig Rusin, Daniel Penny, Ryan Coleman, Charles Peskin	None	None	This paper describes computer models of three interventions used for treating refractory pulmonary hypertension (RPH). These procedures create either an atrial septal defect, a ventricular septal defect, or, in the case of a Potts shunt, a patent ductus arteriosus. The aim in all three cases is to generate a right-to-left shunt, allowing for either pressure or volume unloading of the right side of the heart in the setting of right ventricular failure, while maintaining cardiac output. These shunts are created, however, at the expense of introducing de-oxygenated blood into the systemic circulation, thereby lowering the systemic arterial oxygen saturation. The models developed in this paper are based on compartmental descriptions of human hemodynamics and oxygen transport. An important parameter included in our models is the cross-sectional area of the surgically created defect. Numerical simulations are performed to compare different interventions and various shunt sizes and to assess their impact on hemodynamic variables and oxygen saturations. We also create a model for exercise and use it to study exercise tolerance in simulated pre-intervention and post-intervention RPH patients.

 Quadratic estimators for CMB weak lensing	Abhishek Maniyar, Yacine AliHamoud, Julien Carron, Antony Lewis, Mathew Madhavacheril	abhishek.maniyar@nyu.edu	None	In recent years, weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe fundamental physics, such as neutrino masses, primordial non-Gaussianity, dark energy, and modified gravity. The prime target of CMB lensing surveys is the lensing potential, which is reconstructed from the observed CMB temperature T ùëá T italic_T and polarization E ùê∏ E italic_E and B ùêµ B italic_B fields. Until very recently, this reconstruction has been performed with quadratic estimators (QEs), which, although known to be suboptimal for high-sensitivity experiments, are numerically efficient, and useful to make forecasts and cross-check the results of more sophisticated likelihood-based methods. It is expected that ongoing and near-future CMB experiments such as AdvACT, SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory (SO), will also rely on QEs. In this work, we review different QEs, and clarify and quantify their differences. In particular, we show that the Hu-Okamoto (HO02) estimator is not the absolute optimal lensing estimator that can be constructed out of quadratic combinations of T , E ùëá ùê∏ T,E italic_T , italic_E and B ùêµ B italic_B fields. Instead, we derive the global-minimum-variance (GMV) lensing quadratic estimator. Although this estimator can be found elsewhere in the literature, it was erroneously described as equivalent to the HO02 estimator, and has never been used in real data analyses. Here, we show explicitly that the HO02 estimator is suboptimal to the GMV estimator, with a reconstruction noise larger by up to ‚àº 9 % similar-to absent percent 9 \sim 9\% ‚àº 9 % for a SO-like experiment. We further show that the QE used in the Planck, and recent SPT lensing analysis is suboptimal to both the HO02 and GMV estimator, and would have a reconstruction noise up to ‚àº 11 % similar-to absent percent 11 \sim 11\% ‚àº 11 % larger than that of the GMV estimator for a SO-like experiment. In addition to clarifying differences between different QEs, this work should thus provide motivation to implement the GMV estimator in future lensing analyses relying on QEs.

 Playable Video Generation	Willi MenapaceUniversity of Trento, Stphane LathuilireLTCI, Tlcom ParisInstitut Polytechnique de Paris, Sergey TulyakovSnap Inc, Aliaksandr SiarohinUniversity of Trento, Elisa RicciUniversity of TrentoFondazione Bruno Kessler	None	None	This paper introduces the unsupervised learning problem of playable video generation (PVG). In PVG, we aim at allowing a user to control the generated video by selecting a discrete action at every time step as when playing a video game. The difficulty of the task lies both in learning semantically consistent actions and in generating realistic videos conditioned on the user input. We propose a novel framework for PVG that is trained in a self-supervised manner on a large dataset of unlabelled videos. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture where the predicted action labels act as bottleneck. The network is constrained to learn a rich action space using, as main driving loss, a reconstruction loss on the generated video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several datasets with wide environment variety. Further details, code and examples are available on our project page willi-menapace.github.io/playable-video-generation-website .	
 Echoes of Compact Objects in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity	Christoforos Vlachos, Eleftherios Papantonopoulos,Kyriakos Destounis	None	None	Scalar-tensor theory predicts solutions to the gravitational field equations which describe compact objects in the presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field to the Einstein tensor. These objects are black holes with scalar hair and wormholes supporting scalar phantom matter. The evolution of test fields in fixed asymptotically-flat backgrounds of exotic compact objects leads to the formation of echoes in the ringdown signal, which designate the existence of trapping regions close to the event horizon. Here, we consider minimally-coupled test scalar fields propagating on compact object solutions of the Horndeski action, which possess an effective cosmological constant, leading to anti-de Sitter asymptotics, and show that echoes can form in the ringdown waveform due to the entrapment of test fields between the photon sphere and the effective asymptotic boundary. Although the presence of an event horizon leads to the usual echoes with decaying amplitude, signifying modal stability of the scalarized black hole considered, we find that test scalar fields propagating on a scalarized wormhole solution give rise to echoes of constant and equal amplitude to that of the initial ringdown, indicating the existence of normal modes. Finally, we find that, near extremality, the test field exhibits a concatenation of echoes; the primary ones are associated with the trapping region between the photon sphere and the effective anti-de Sitter boundary while the secondary ones are linked to the existence of a potential well at the throat of the wormhole.	
 The flow group of rooted abelian or quadratic differentials	Mark Bell, Vincent Delecroix, Vaibhav Gadre, Rodolfo GutirrezRomo, Saul Schleimer	mark00bell@googlemail.com	IndependentUK	We define the flow group of any component of any stratum of rooted abelian or quadratic differentials (those marked with a horizontal separatrix) to be the group generated by almost-flow loops. We prove that the flow group is equal to the fundamental group of the component. As a corollary, we show that the plus and minus modular Rauzy‚ÄìVeech groups are finite-index subgroups of their ambient modular monodromy groups. This partially answers a question of Yoccoz. Using this, and recent advances on algebraic hulls and Zariski closures of monodromy groups, we prove that the Rauzy‚ÄìVeech groups are Zariski dense in their ambient symplectic groups. Density, in turn, implies the simplicity of the plus and minus Lyapunov spectra of any component of any stratum of quadratic differentials. Thus, we establish the Kontsevich‚ÄìZorich conjecture.	
 A Spectral Approach to Polytope Diameter	Hariharan NarayananTIFR Mumbai, Rikhav ShahUC Berkeley, Nikhil SrivastavaUC Berkeley	None	None	We prove upper bounds on the graph diameters of polytopes in two settings. The first is a worst-case bound for polytopes defined by integer constraints in terms of the height of the integers and certain subdeterminants of the constraint matrix, which in some cases improves previously known results. The second is a smoothed analysis bound: given an appropriately normalized polytope, we add small Gaussian noise to each constraint. We consider a natural geometric measure on the vertices of the perturbed polytope (corresponding to the mean curvature measure of its polar) and show that with high probability there exists a ‚Äúgiant component‚Äù of vertices, with measure 1 ‚àí o ( 1 ) 1 ùëú 1 1-o(1) 1 - italic_o ( 1 ) and polynomial diameter. Both bounds rely on spectral gaps ‚Äî of a certain Schr√∂dinger operator in the first case, and a certain continuous time Markov chain in the second ‚Äî which arise from the log-concavity of the volume of a simple polytope in terms of its slack variables.

Simulations of the evolution of stellar streams in live N ùëÅ N italic_N -body halos without low-mass dark-matter subhalos, however, indicate that streams exhibit significant perturbations on small scales even in the absence of substructure. Here we demonstrate, using high-resolution N ùëÅ N italic_N -body simulations combined with sophisticated semi-analytic and simple analytic models, that the mass resolutions of 10 4 superscript 10 4 10^{4} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Äì 10 5 M ‚äô superscript 10 5 subscript M direct-product 10^{5}\,\rm{M}_{\odot} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT commonly used to perform such simulations cause spurious stream density variations with a similar magnitude on large scales as those expected from a CDM-like subhalo population and an order of magnitude larger on small, yet observable, scales.

That streams are sensitive to a simulation‚Äôs particle mass down to such small masses indicates that streams are sensitive to dark matter clustering down to these low masses if a significant fraction of the dark matter is clustered or concentrated in this way, for example, in MACHO models with masses of 10 10 10 10 ‚Äì 100 M ‚äô 100 subscript M direct-product 100\,\rm{M}_{\odot} 100 roman_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .

Public social media platforms such as Twitter represent important sites of engagement regarding the pandemic and these data can be used by research teams for social, health, and other research. Understanding public opinion about COVID-19 and how information diffuses in social media is important for governments and research institutions. Twitter is a ubiquitous public platform and, as such, has tremendous utility for understanding public perceptions, behavior, and attitudes related to COVID-19. In this research, we present CML-COVID, a COVID-19 Twitter data set of 19,298,967 million tweets from 5,977,653 unique individuals and summarize some of the attributes of these data. These tweets were collected between March 2020 and July 2020 using the query terms ‚Äòcoronavirus‚Äô, ‚Äòcovid‚Äô and ‚Äòmask‚Äô related to COVID-19. We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and descriptive statistics to describe the tweets related to COVID-19 we collected and the geographical location of tweets, where available.

 Federated Multi-Armed Bandits	Chengshuai Shi,Cong Shen	None	None	Federated multi-armed bandits (FMAB) is a new bandit paradigm that parallels the federated learning (FL) framework in supervised learning. It is inspired by practical applications in cognitive radio and recommender systems, and enjoys features that are analogous to FL. This paper proposes a general framework of FMAB and then studies two specific federated bandit models. We first study the approximate model where the heterogeneous local models are random realizations of the global model from an unknown distribution. This model introduces a new uncertainty of client sampling , as the global model may not be reliably learned even if the finite local models are perfectly known. Furthermore, this uncertainty cannot be quantified a priori without knowledge of the suboptimality gap. We solve the approximate model by proposing Federated Double UCB (Fed2-UCB), which constructs a novel ‚Äúdouble UCB‚Äù principle accounting for uncertainties from both arm and client sampling. We show that gradually admitting new clients is critical in achieving an O ( log ‚Å° ( T ) ) ùëÇ ùëá O(\log(T)) italic_O ( roman_log ( italic_T ) ) regret while explicitly considering the communication cost. The exact model, where the global bandit model is the exact average of heterogeneous local models, is then studied as a special case. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the order-optimal regret can be achieved independent of the number of clients with a careful choice of the update periodicity. Experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical analysis and provide interesting insight into the proposed algorithms.

However, the interpretation of the secondary as a planet (i.e., as having M p < 13 M Jup subscript ùëÄ p 13 subscript ùëÄ Jup M_{\rm p}<13M_{\rm Jup} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_p end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 13 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Jup end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) rests entirely on the Bayesian analysis.

 Insights from exact exchange-correlation kernels	Woods, Entwistle, Godby	nw361@cam.ac.uk	None	The exact exchange-correlation (xc) kernel f xc ( x , x ‚Ä≤ , œâ ) subscript ùëì xc ùë• superscript ùë• ‚Ä≤ ùúî f_{\text{xc}}(x,x^{\prime},\omega) italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x , italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_œâ ) of linear response time-dependent density functional theory is computed over a wide range of frequencies, for three canonical one-dimensional finite systems. Methods used to ensure the numerical robustness of f xc subscript ùëì xc f_{\text{xc}} italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are set out. The frequency dependence of f xc subscript ùëì xc f_{\text{xc}} italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is found to be due largely to its analytic structure, i.e. its singularities at certain frequencies, which are required in order to capture particular transitions, including those of double excitation character. However, within the frequency range of the first few interacting excitations, f xc subscript ùëì xc f_{\text{xc}} italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is approximately œâ ùúî \omega italic_œâ -independent, meaning the exact adiabatic approximation f xc ( œâ = 0 ) subscript ùëì xc ùúî 0 f_{\text{xc}}(\omega=0) italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_œâ = 0 ) remedies the failings of the local density approximation and random phase approximation for these lowest transitions. The key differences between the exact f xc subscript ùëì xc f_{\text{xc}} italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and its common approximations are analyzed, and cannot be eliminated by exploiting the limited gauge freedom in f xc subscript ùëì xc f_{\text{xc}} italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . The optical spectrum benefits from using as accurate as possible an f xc subscript ùëì xc f_{\text{xc}} italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT xc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ground-state xc potential, while maintaining exact compatibility between the two is of less importance.

 Emergence of Quasi-equilibrium State and Energy Distribution for the Beads-spring Molecule Interacting with a Solvent	Tatsuo Yanagita, Tetsuro Konishi	yanagita@osakac.ac.jp	None	We study the energy distribution during the emergence of a quasi-equilibrium (QE) state in the course of relaxation to equipartition in slow-fast Hamiltonian systems. A bead-spring model where beads (masses) are connected by springs is considered, and it is used as a model of polymers. The QE lasts for a long time because the energy exchange between the high-frequency vibrational and other motions is prevented when springs in the molecule become stiff. We numerically calculated the time-averaged kinetic energy and found that the kinetic energy of the solvent particles was always higher than that of the bead in a molecule. This is explained by adapting the equipartition theorem in QE, and it agrees well with the numerical results. The energy difference can help determine how far the system is from achieving equilibrium, and it can be used as an indicator of the number of frozen or inactive degrees exist in the molecule.

Computational tools are being developed to take advantage of existing information, encapsulating knowledge and making it available in a simple way for general public use. However, these are property-specific redundant data systems, and usually do not display the data in a clear way. In some cases, information download is not even possible. This data needs to be available in a simple form for drug design and other biotechnological applications. Results : We developed Peptipedia, a user-friendly database and web application to search, characterise and analyse peptide sequences. Our tool integrates the information from thirty previously reported databases, making it the largest repository of peptides with recorded activities so far. Besides, we implemented a variety of services to increase our tool‚Äôs usability. The significant differences of our tools with other existing alternatives becomes a substantial contribution to develop biotechnological and bioengineering applications for peptides.

Contrasting integrated star formation rates (SFRs), we find that the slope and normalization of the star-forming main sequence in TNG50 are quantitatively consistent with values derived by fitting observations from 3D-HST with the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1 dex between observed and simulated main sequence normalizations are resolved when using the updated masses and SFRs from Prospector .

In TNG this inside-out quenching is due to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion rates. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation, without this same physical SMBH mechanism, does not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression seen in data. The observed sSFR profiles provide support for the TNG quenching mechanism and how it affects gas on kiloparsec scales in the centers of galaxies.	
 Celestial-Body Focused Dark Matter Annihilation Throughout the Galaxy	Rebecca Leane, Tim Linden, Payel Mukhopadhyay, Natalia Toro	None	None	Indirect detection experiments typically measure the flux of annihilating dark matter (DM) particles propagating freely through galactic halos. We consider a new scenario where celestial bodies ‚Äúfocus‚Äù DM annihilation events, increasing the efficiency of halo annihilation. In this setup, DM is first captured by celestial bodies, such as neutron stars or brown dwarfs, and then annihilates within them. If DM annihilates to sufficiently long-lived particles, they can escape and subsequently decay into detectable radiation. This produces a distinctive annihilation morphology, which scales as the product of the DM and celestial body densities, rather than as DM density squared. We show that this signal can dominate over the halo annihilation rate in Œ≥ ùõæ \gamma italic_Œ≥ -ray observations in both the Milky Way Galactic center and globular clusters. We use Fermi and H.E.S.S. data to constrain the DM-nucleon scattering cross section, setting powerful new limits down to ‚àº 10 ‚àí 39 similar-to absent superscript 10 39 \sim 10^{-39}~{} ‚àº 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 39 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm 2 2 {}^{2} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT for sub-GeV DM using brown dwarfs, which is up to nine orders of magnitude stronger than existing limits.

 Multimessenger signals from black hole-neutron star mergers without significant tidal disruption	William East, Luis Lehner, Steven Liebling, Carlos Palenzuela	None	None	We study the multimessenger signals from the merger of a black hole with a magnetized neutron star using resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations coupled to full general relativity. We focus on a case with a 5:1 mass ratio, where only a small amount of the neutron star matter remains post-merger, but we nevertheless find that significant electromagnetic radiation can be powered by the interaction of the neutron star‚Äôs magnetosphere with the black hole. In the lead-up to merger, strong twisting of magnetic field lines from the inspiral leads to plasmoid emission and results in a luminosity in excess of that expected from unipolar induction. We find that the strongest emission occurs shortly after merger during a transitory period in which magnetic loops form and escape the central region. The remaining magnetic field collimates around the spin axis of the remnant black hole before dissipating, an indication that, in more favorable scenarios (higher black hole spin/lower mass ratio) with larger accretion disks, a jet would form.

We find a handful of systems with both a Large and a Small Magellanic Cloud-like satellite. There is no missing satellites problem according to TNG50.	
 Accreted or Not Accreted? The Fraction of Accreted Mass in Galaxies from Simulations and Observations	RheaSilvia RemusstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTandDuncan ForbesstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTUniversittsSternwarte Mnchen, Fakultt fr Physik, LMU Mnchen, Scheinerstr, Mnchen, GermanystartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTCentre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn VIC , Australia	None	None	In the two-phase scenario of galaxy formation, a galaxy‚Äôs stellar mass growth is first dominated by in-situ star formation, and subsequently by accretion. We analyse the radial distribution of the accreted stellar mass in ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 500 galaxies from the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum. Generally, we find good agreement with other simulations in that higher mass galaxies have larger accreted fractions, but we predict higher accretion fractions for low-mass galaxies. Based on the radial distribution of the accreted and in-situ components, we define 6 galaxy classes, from completely accretion dominated to completely in-situ dominated, and measure the transition radii between in-situ and accretion-dominated regions for galaxies that have such a transition. About 70% of our galaxies have one transition radius. However, we also find about 10% of the galaxies to be accretion dominated everywhere, and about 13% to have two transition radii, with the centre and the outskirts both being accretion dominated. We show that these classes are strongly correlated with the galaxy merger histories, especially with the mergers‚Äô cold gas fractions. We find high total in-situ (low accretion) fractions to be associated with smaller, lower mass galaxies, lower central dark matter fractions, and larger transition radii. Finally, we show that the dips in observed surface brightness profiles seen in many early-type galaxies do not correspond to the transition from in-situ to accretion-dominated regions, and any inferred mass fractions are not indicative of the true accreted mass. Instead, these dips contain information about the galaxies‚Äô dry minor merger assembly history.	
 Outflows, Shocks and Coronal Line Emission in a Radio-Selected AGN in a Dwarf Galaxy	Mallory Molina, Amy Reines, Jenny Greene, Jeremy Darling, James Condon	None	None	Massive black holes (BHs) in dwarf galaxies can provide strong constraints on BH seeds, however reliably detecting them is notoriously difficult. High resolution radio observations were recently used to identify accreting massive BHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, with a significant fraction found to be non-nuclear. Here we present the first results of our optical follow-up of these radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using integral field unit (IFU) data from Gemini-North. We focus on the dwarf galaxy J1220+3020, which shows no clear optical AGN signatures in its nuclear SDSS spectrum covering the radio source. With our new IFU data, we confirm the presence of an active BH via the AGN coronal line [ Fe X ] and enhanced [ O I ] emission coincident with the radio source. Furthermore, we detect broad H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± emission and estimate a BH mass of M BH = 10 4.9 M ‚äô subscript ùëÄ BH superscript 10 4.9 subscript ùëÄ direct-product M_{\rm BH}=10^{4.9}M_{\odot} italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_BH end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4.9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . We compare the narrow emission line ratios to standard BPT diagnostics and shock models. Spatially-resolved BPT diagrams show some AGN signatures, particularly in [ O I ]/H Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± , but overall do not unambiguously identify the AGN. A comparison of our data to shock models clearly indicates shocked emission surrounding the AGN. The physical model most consistent with the data is an active BH with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) that both photoionizes and shock-excites the surrounding gas. We conclude that feedback is important in radio-selected BHs in dwarf galaxies, and that radio surveys may probe a population of low accretion-rate BHs in dwarf galaxies that cannot be detected through optical surveys alone.

To this aim, we couple the radiative transfer code SKIRT to the output of the TNG50 simulation and measure the dust-continuum half-light radius of the modeled galaxies, assuming a Milky Way dust type and a metallicity dependent dust-to-metal ratio. The dust-continuum half-light radius at observed-frame 850 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m is up to ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 75 per cent larger than the stellar half-mass radius, but significantly more compact than the observed-frame 1.6 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m (roughly corresponding to H-band) half-light radius, particularly towards high redshifts: the compactness compared to the 1.6 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m emission increases with redshift. This is driven by obscuration of stellar light from the galaxy centres, which increases the apparent extent of 1.6 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m disk sizes relative to that at 850 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m. The difference in relative extents increases with redshift because the observed-frame 1.6 Œº ùúá \mu italic_Œº m emission stems from ever shorter wavelength stellar emission. These results suggest that the compact dust-continuum emission observed in z > 1 ùëß 1 z>1 italic_z > 1 galaxies is not (necessarily) evidence of the buildup of a dense central stellar component. We also find that the dust-continuum half-light radius very closely follows the radius containing half the star formation in galaxies, indicating that single band dust-continuum emission is a good tracer of the location of (obscured) star formation. The dust-continuum emission is more compact than the H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT mass (for galaxies at z ‚â• 2 ùëß 2 z\geq 2 italic_z ‚â• 2 ) and the underlying dust mass. The dust emission strongly correlates with locations with the highest dust temperatures, which do not need to be the locations where most H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and/or dust is located. The presented results are a common feature of main-sequence galaxies.	
 Spin-Orbit coupling in the Kagome lattice with flux and time-reversal symmetry	Irakli Titvinidze, Julian Legendre, Maarten Grothus, Bernhard Irsigler, Karyn Le Hur, Walter Hofstetter	titvinidze@itp.uni-frankfurt.de	None	We study the topological properties of a spin-orbit coupled tight-binding model with flux on the Kagome lattice. The model is time-reversal invariant and realizes a ‚Ñ§ 2 subscript ‚Ñ§ 2 \mathbb{Z}_{2} roman_‚Ñ§ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT topological insulator as a result of artificial gauge fields. We develop topological arguments to describe this system showing three inequivalent sites in a unit cell and a flat band in its energy spectrum in addition to the topological dispersive energy bands. We show the stability of the topological phase towards spin-flip processes and different types of on-site potentials. In particular, we also address the situation where on-site energies may differ inside a unit cell. Moreover, a staggered potential on the lattice may realize topological phases for the half-filled situation. Another interesting result is the occurrence of a topological phase for large on-site energies. To describe topological properties of the system we use a numerical approach based on the twisted boundary conditions and we develop a mathematical approach, related to smooth fields.	
 Neutron Stars Harboring a Primordial Black Hole: Maximum Survival Time	Thomas WBaumgarte, Stuart LShapiro	None	None	We explore in general relativity the survival time of neutron stars that host an endoparasitic, possibly primordial, black hole at their center. Corresponding to the minimum steady-state Bondi accretion rate for adiabatic flow that we found earlier for stiff nuclear equations of state (EOSs), we derive analytically the maximum survival time after which the entire star will be consumed by the black hole. We also show that this maximum survival time depends only weakly on the stiffness for polytropic EOSs with Œì ‚â• 5 / 3 Œì 5 3 \Gamma\geq 5/3 roman_Œì ‚â• 5 / 3 , so that this survival time assumes a nearly universal value that depends on the initial black hole mass alone.

 Baby Universes and Worldline Field Theories	Eduardo Casali, Donald Marolf, Henry Maxfield, Mukund Rangamani	None	None	The quantum gravity path integral involves a sum over topologies that invites comparisons to worldsheet string theory and to Feynman diagrams of quantum field theory. However, the latter are naturally associated with the non-abelian algebra of quantum fields, while the former has been argued to define an abelian algebra of superselected observables associated with partition-function-like quantities at an asymptotic boundary. We resolve this apparent tension by pointing out a variety of discrete choices that must be made in constructing a Hilbert space from such path integrals, and arguing that the natural choices for quantum gravity differ from those used to construct QFTs. We focus on one-dimensional models of quantum gravity in order to make direct comparisons with worldline QFT. We also restrict attention to models in which worldlines do not split apart or join together.	
 1 Introduction			None	We illustrate the observability of the end stages of the earliest (Population III) stars at high redshifts z ‚â≥ 10 greater-than-or-equivalent-to ùëß 10 z\gtrsim 10 italic_z ‚â≥ 10 , using the recently observed transient, GN-z11-flash as an example. We find that the observed spectrum of this transient is consistent with its originating from a shock-breakout in a Population III supernova occurring in the GN-z11 galaxy at z ‚àº 11 similar-to ùëß 11 z\sim 11 italic_z ‚àº 11 .

We forecast the expected number of such transients from z > 10 ùëß 10 z>10 italic_z > 10 galaxies as a function of their host stellar mass and star formation rate. Our findings are important in the context of future searches to detect and identify the signatures of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.	
 Fast estimation of outcome probabilities for quantum circuits	Hakop Pashayan, Oliver ReardonSmith, Kamil Korzekwa, Stephen Bartlett	None	None	We present two classical algorithms for the simulation of universal quantum circuits on n ùëõ n italic_n qubits constructed from c ùëê c italic_c instances of Clifford gates and t ùë° t italic_t arbitrary-angle Z ùëç Z italic_Z -rotation gates such as T ùëá T italic_T gates. Our algorithms complement each other by performing best in different parameter regimes. The Estimate algorithm produces an additive precision estimate of the Born rule probability of a chosen measurement outcome with the only source of run-time inefficiency being a linear dependence on the stabilizer extent (which scales like ‚âà 1.17 t absent superscript 1.17 ùë° \approx 1.17^{t} ‚âà 1.17 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for T ùëá T italic_T gates).

Compute can be effective in surprisingly challenging parameter regimes, e.g., we can randomly sample Clifford+ T ùëá T italic_T circuits with n = 55 ùëõ 55 n=55 italic_n = 55 , w = 5 ùë§ 5 w=5 italic_w = 5 , c = 10 5 ùëê superscript 10 5 c=10^{5} italic_c = 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and t = 80 ùë° 80 t=80 italic_t = 80 T ùëá T italic_T gates, and then compute the Born rule probability with a run-time consistently less than 10 10 10 10 minutes using a single core of a standard desktop computer. We provide a C+Python implementation of our algorithms and benchmark them using random circuits, the hidden shift algorithm and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).

Australia	None	None	We have entered a new era where integral-field spectroscopic surveys of galaxies are sufficiently large to adequately sample large-scale structure over a cosmologically significant volume. This was the primary design goal of the SAMI Galaxy Survey. Here, in Data Release 3 (DR3), we release data for the full sample of 3068 unique galaxies observed. This includes the SAMI cluster sample of 888 unique galaxies for the first time. For each galaxy, there are two primary spectral cubes covering the blue (370‚Äì570 nm) and red (630‚Äì740 nm) optical wavelength ranges at spectral resolving power of R = 1808 ùëÖ 1808 R=1808 italic_R = 1808 and 4304 respectively. For each primary cube, we also provide three spatially binned spectral cubes and a set of standardized aperture spectra. For each galaxy, we include complete 2D maps from parameterized fitting to the emission-line and absorption-line spectral data. These maps provide information on the gas ionization and kinematics, stellar kinematics and populations, and more. All data are available online through Australian Astronomical Optics (AAO) Data Central.	
 Scalable authentication and optimal flooding in a quantum network	Naomi Solomons, Alasdair Fletcher, Djeylan Aktas, Natarajan Venkatachalam, Sren Wengerowsky, Martin Lonari, Sebastian Neumann, Bo Liu, eljko Samec, Mario Stipevi, Rupert Ursin, Stefano Pirandola, John Rarity, Siddarth Koduru Joshi	None	None	The global interest in quantum networks stems from the security guaranteed by the laws of physics. Deploying quantum networks means facing the challenges of scaling up the physical hardware and, more importantly, of scaling up all other network layers and optimally utilising network resources. Here we consider two related protocols, their experimental demonstrations on an 8-user quantum network test-bed, and discuss their usefulness with the aid of example use cases. First, an authentication transfer protocol to manage a fundamental limitation of quantum communication ‚Äì the need for a pre-shared key between every pair of users linked together on the quantum network. By temporarily trusting some intermediary nodes for a short period of time ( < < < 35 min in our network), we can generate and distribute these initial authentication keys with a very high level of security. Second, when end users quantify their trust in intermediary nodes, our flooding protocol can be used to improve both end-to-end communication speeds and increase security against malicious nodes.

We show that the key factors determining the dwarfs‚Äô SFHs are their status as central or satellite and their stellar mass, with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times on average compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs.

TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs for both centrals and satellites, so that the stacked cumulative SFHs are representative of the TNG50 dwarf populations only in an average sense and individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs. In the case of the satellites, dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host mass ratios have the latest stellar mass assembly. Conversely, satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass found closer to the cluster centre or accreted at earlier times show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends, as well as the shapes of the SFHs themselves, are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given subsample of quenched vs. star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly distinct SFH shapes. We also find a subtle effect whereby satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts at z = 0 ùëß 0 z=0 italic_z = 0 are more efficient, i.e. have higher SFRs, at early times, well before final infall into their z = 0 ùëß 0 z=0 italic_z = 0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched at the time of accretion. This suggests that the large-scale environment can have a mild effect even on future satellites by providing the conditions for enhanced SF at early epochs. Our results are useful theoretical predictions for comparison to future resolved-stellar-population observations.	
 Distinctive class of dissipation-induced phase transitions and their universal characteristics	Matteo Soriente, Toni Heugel, Keita Arimitsu, Chitra, Oded Zilberberg	None	None	Coupling a system to a nonthermal environment can profoundly affect the phase diagram of the closed system, giving rise to a special class of dissipation-induced phase transitions. Such transitions take the system out of its ground state and stabilize a higher-energy stationary state, rendering it the sole attractor of the dissipative dynamics. In this paper, we present a unifying methodology, which we use to characterize this ubiquitous phenomenology and its implications for the open system dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the closed system‚Äôs phase diagram, including symmetry-broken phases, and explore their corresponding excitations‚Äô spectra. Opening the system, the environment can overwhelm the system‚Äôs symmetry-breaking tendencies, and changes its order parameter. As a result, isolated distinct phases of similar order become connected, and new phase-costability regions appear. Interestingly, the excitations differ in the newly connected regions through a change in their symplectic norm, which is robust to the introduction of dissipation. As a result, by tuning the system from one phase to the other across the dissipation-stabilized region, the open system fluctuations exhibit an exceptional point like scenario, where the fluctuations become overdamped, only to reappear with an opposite sign in the dynamical response function of the system. The overdamped region is also associated with squeezing of the fluctuations. We demonstrate the pervasive nature of such dissipation-induced phenomena in two prominent examples, namely, in parametric resonators and in light-matter systems. Our work draws a crucial distinction between quantum phase transitions and their zero-temperature open system counterparts.	
 Definitions of (super) angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes: Properties and applications to compact-binary mergers	Arwa Elhashash, David ANichols	aze5tn@virginia.edu	None	The symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes in general relativity are given by the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, though there are proposed generalizations of its symmetry algebra. Associated with each symmetry is a charge and a flux, and the values of these charges and their changes can characterize a spacetime. The charges of the BMS group are relativistic angular momentum and supermomentum (which includes 4-momentum); the extensions of the BMS algebra also include generalizations of angular momentum called ‚Äúsuper angular momentum.‚Äù Several different formalisms have been used to define angular momentum, and they produce nonequivalent expressions for the charge. It was shown recently that these definitions can be summarized in a two-parameter family of angular momenta, which we investigate in this paper. We find that requiring that the angular momentum vanishes in flat spacetime restricts the two parameters to be equal. If we do not require that the angular momentum agrees with a common Hamiltonian definition, then we are left with a one-parameter family of angular momenta that includes the definitions from the several different formalisms. We then also propose a similar two-parameter family of super angular momentum. We examine the effect of the free parameters on the values of the angular momentum and super angular momentum from nonprecessing binary-black-hole mergers. The definitions of angular momentum differ at a high post-Newtonian order for these systems, but only when the system is radiating gravitational waves (not before and after). The different super-angular-momentum definitions occur at lower orders, and there is a difference in the change of super angular momentum even after the gravitational waves pass, which arises because of the gravitational-wave memory effect. We estimate the size of these effects using numerical-relativity surrogate waveforms and find they are small but resolvable.	
 Dark acoustic oscillations: Imprints on the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function	Timothe SchaefferstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Aurel SchneiderstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTCenter for Theoretical Astrophysics and Cosmology, Institute for Computational Science, University of Zurich,Winterthurerstrasse , CH Zrich, Switzerland	None	None	Many non-minimal dark matter scenarios lead to oscillatory features in the matter power spectrum induced by interactions either within the dark sector or with particles from the standard model. Observing such dark acoustic oscillations would therefore be a major step towards understanding dark matter. We investigate what happens to oscillatory features during the process of nonlinear structure formation. We show that at the level of the power spectrum, oscillations are smoothed out by nonlinear mode coupling, gradually disappearing towards lower redshifts. In the halo mass function, however, the oscillatory features remain visible until the present epoch. As a consequence, dark acoustic oscillations could be detectable in observations that are either based on the halo mass function or on the high-redshift power spectrum. We investigate the effect of such features on different observables, namely, the cluster mass function, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, and the Lyman- Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± flux power spectrum. We find that oscillatory features remain visible in all of these observables, but they are very extended and of low amplitude, making it challenging to detect them as distinct features in the data.	
 Mechanism for Strong Chimeras	Yuanzhao Zhang, Adilson Motter	None	None	Chimera states have attracted significant attention as symmetry-broken states exhibiting the unexpected coexistence of coherence and incoherence. Despite the valuable insights gained from analyzing specific systems, an understanding of the general physical mechanism underlying the emergence of chimeras is still lacking. Here, we show that many stable chimeras arise because coherence in part of the system is sustained by incoherence in the rest of the system. This mechanism may be regarded as a deterministic analog of noise-induced synchronization and is shown to underlie the emergence of strong chimeras. These are chimera states whose coherent domain is formed by identically synchronized oscillators. Recognizing this mechanism offers a new meaning to the interpretation that chimeras are a natural link between coherence and incoherence.	
 gleam: Galaxy Line Emission & Absorption Modeling	Andra Stroe, VictorNicolae Savu	None	None	We present gleam ( G alaxy L ine E mission & A bsorption M odeling), a Python tool for fitting Gaussian models to emission and absorption lines in large samples of 1D extragalactic spectra. gleam is tailored to work well in batch mode without much human interaction. With gleam , users can uniformly process a variety of spectra, including galaxies and active galactic nuclei, in a wide range of instrument setups and signal-to-noise regimes. gleam also takes advantage of multiprocessing capabilities to process spectra in parallel. With the goal of enabling reproducible workflows for its users, gleam employs a small number of input files, including a central, user-friendly configuration in which fitting constraints can be defined for groups of spectra and overrides can be specified for edge cases. For each spectrum, gleam produces a table containing measurements and error bars for the detected spectral lines and continuum, and upper limits for non-detections. For visual inspection and publishing, gleam can also produce plots of the data with fitted lines overlaid. In the present paper, we describe gleam ‚Äôs main features, the necessary inputs, expected outputs, and some example applications, including thorough tests on a large sample of optical/infra-red multi-object spectroscopic observations and integral field spectroscopic data. gleam is developed as an open-source project hosted at https://github.com/multiwavelength/gleam and welcomes community contributions.	
 The Carnegie Chicago Hubble Program X: Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances to NGC 5643 and NGC 1404	Taylor Hoyt, Rachael Beaton, Wendy Freedman, In Sung Jang, MyungGyoonLee, Barry Madore, Andrew Monson, JillianRNeeley, Jeffrey Rich, Mark Seibert	None	None	The primary goal of the Carnegie Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP) is to calibrate the zero-point of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) Hubble Diagram through the use of Population II standard candles. So far, the CCHP has measured direct distances to 11 SNe Ia, and here we increase that number to 15 with two new TRGB distances measured to NGC 5643 and NGC 1404, for a total of 20 SN Ia calibrators. We present resolved, point-source photometry from new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of these two galaxies in the F814W and F606W bandpasses. From each galaxy‚Äôs stellar halo, we construct an F814W-band luminosity function in which we detect an unambiguous edge feature identified as the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). For NGC 5643, we find Œº 0 = subscript ùúá 0 absent \mu_{0}= italic_Œº start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 30.48 ¬± limit-from 30.48 plus-or-minus 30.48~{}\pm 30.48 ¬± 0.03(stat) ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 0.07(sys) mag, and for NGC 1404 we find Œº 0 = subscript ùúá 0 absent \mu_{0}= italic_Œº start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 31.36 ¬± limit-from 31.36 plus-or-minus 31.36~{}\pm 31.36 ¬± 0.04(stat) ¬± plus-or-minus \pm ¬± 0.05(sys) mag. From a preliminary consideration of the SNe Ia in these galaxies, we find increased confidence in the results presented in Paper VIII (Freedman et al., 2019 ) . The high precision of our TRGB distances enables a significant measurement of the 3D displacement between the Fornax Cluster galaxies NGC 1404 and NGC 1316 (Fornax A) equal to 1.50 ‚àí 0.39 + 0.25 subscript superscript 1.50 0.25 0.39 1.50^{+0.25}_{-0.39} 1.50 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 0.25 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 0.39 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT Mpc, which we show is in agreement with independent literature constraints.	
 The Bethe-Ansatz approach to the ùí©=4 superconformal index at finite rank	, , , 	agonzale@ictp.it	None	We investigate the Bethe-Ansatz approach to the superconformal index of ùí© = 4 ùí© 4 {\cal N}=4 caligraphic_N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills with SU( N ùëÅ N italic_N ) gauge group in the context of finite rank, N ùëÅ N italic_N . We explicitly explore the role of the various types of solutions to the Bethe-Ansatz Equations in recovering the exact index for N = 2 , 3 ùëÅ 2 3 N=2,3 italic_N = 2 , 3 . We classify the Bethe-Ansatz Equations solutions as standard (corresponding to a freely acting orbifold T 2 / ‚Ñ§ m √ó ‚Ñ§ n superscript ùëá 2 subscript ‚Ñ§ ùëö subscript ‚Ñ§ ùëõ T^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{m}\times\mathbb{Z}_{n} italic_T start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT / blackboard_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT √ó blackboard_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and non-standard. For N = 2 ùëÅ 2 N=2 italic_N = 2 , we find that the index is fully recovered by standard solutions and displays an interesting pattern of cancellations. However, for N ‚â• 3 ùëÅ 3 N\geq 3 italic_N ‚â• 3 , the standard solutions alone do not suffice to reconstruct the index. We present quantitative arguments in various regimes of fugacities that highlight the challenging role played by the continuous families of non-standard solutions.	
 Dual gauge theory formulation of planar quasicrystal elasticity and fractons	Piotr Surwka	surowka@pks.mpg.de	None	Elastic description of planar quasicrystals can be formulated as an interplay between two Goldstone fields corresponding to phonon and phason degrees of freedom. We reformulate this description as a gauge theory with one gauge field that is symmetric under exchange of indices and one that is not. We also show that topological defects in quasicrystals can be succinctly incorporated in the dual description and interpret them as fractonic excitations. Finally we calculate the static interaction potential between defects in a quasicrystal with fivefold symmetry. This is done in the limit of a small coupling between phonon and phason stresses.

 Beyond Capacity: The Joint Time-Rate Region	Michael Langberg Michelle Effros	None	None	The traditional notion of capacity studied in the context of memoryless network communication builds on the concept of block-codes and requires that, for sufficiently large blocklength n ùëõ n italic_n , all receiver nodes simultaneously decode their required information after n ùëõ n italic_n channel uses. In this work, we generalize the traditional capacity region by exploring communication rates achievable when some receivers are required to decode their information before others, at different predetermined times; referred here as the time-rate region. Through a reduction to the standard notion of capacity, we present an inner-bound on the time-rate region. The time-rate region has been previously studied and characterized for the memoryless broadcast channel (with a sole common message) under the name static broadcasting .

 Spatially mapping the thermal conductivity of graphene by an opto-thermal method	Oliver Braun, Roman Furrer, Pascal Butti, Kishan Thodkar, Ivan Shorubalko, Ilaria Zardo, Michel Calame, Mickael Perrin	None	None	Mapping the thermal transport properties of materials at the nanoscale is of critical importance for optimizing heat conduction in nanoscale devices. Several methods to determine the thermal conductivity of materials have been developed, most of them yielding an average value across the sample, thereby disregarding the role of local variations. Here, we present a method for the spatially-resolved assessment of the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene by using a combination of confocal Raman thermometry and a finite-element calculations-based fitting procedure. We demonstrate the working principle of our method by extracting the two-dimensional thermal conductivity map of one pristine suspended single-layer graphene sheet and one irradiated using helium ions. Our method paves the way for spatially resolving the thermal conductivity of other types of layered materials. This is particularly relevant for the design and engineering of nanoscale thermal circuits (e.g. thermal diodes).	
 Classical Novae Masquerading as Dwarf Novae? Outburst Properties of Cataclysmic Variables with ASAS-SN	AKawash, LChomiuk, JStrader, EAydi, KVSokolovsky, TJayasinghe, Kochanek, PSchmeer, KZStanek, KMukai, BShappee, ZWay, CBasinger, TWSHoloien, JLPrieto	None	None	The unprecedented sky coverage and observing cadence of the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) has resulted in the discovery and continued monitoring of a large sample of Galactic transients. The vast majority of these are accretion-powered dwarf nova outbursts in cataclysmic variable systems, but a small subset are thermonuclear-powered classical novae. Despite improved monitoring of the Galaxy for novae from ASAS-SN and other surveys, the observed Galactic nova rate is still lower than predictions. One way classical novae could be missed is if they are confused with the much larger population of dwarf novae. Here, we examine the properties of 1617 dwarf nova outbursts detected by ASAS-SN and compare them to classical novae. We find that the mean classical nova brightens by ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 11 magnitudes during outburst, while the mean dwarf nova brightens by only ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 5 magnitudes, with the outburst amplitude distributions overlapping by roughly 15 % percent \% % . For the first time, we show that the amplitude of an outburst and the time it takes to decline by two magnitudes from maximum are positively correlated for dwarf nova outbursts. For classical novae, we find that these quantities are negatively correlated, but only weakly, compared to the strong anti-correlation of these quantities found in some previous work. We show that, even if located at large distances, only a small number of putative dwarf novae could be mis-classified classical novae suggesting that there is minimal confusion between these populations. Future spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates can show whether any are indeed classical novae.	
 Differential Privacy Meets Federated Learning under Communication Constraints	Nima Mohammadi,Jianan Bai,Qiang Fan,Yifei Song,Yang Yi, andLingjia Liu	None	None	The performance of federated learning systems is bottlenecked by communication costs and training variance. The communication overhead problem is usually addressed by three communication-reduction techniques, namely, model compression, partial device participation, and periodic aggregation, at the cost of increased training variance. Different from traditional distributed learning systems, federated learning suffers from data heterogeneity (since the devices sample their data from possibly different distributions), which induces additional variance among devices during training. Various variance-reduced training algorithms have been introduced to combat the effects of data heterogeneity, while they usually cost additional communication resources to deliver necessary control information. Additionally, data privacy remains a critical issue in FL, and thus there have been attempts at bringing Differential Privacy to this framework as a mediator between utility and privacy requirements. This paper investigates the trade-offs between communication costs and training variance under a resource-constrained federated system theoretically and experimentally, and how communication reduction techniques interplay in a differentially private setting. The results provide important insights into designing practical privacy-aware federated learning systems.	
 Uniform Object Rearrangement: From Complete Monotone Primitives to Efficient Non-Monotone Informed Search	Rui WangstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Kai GaostartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Daniel NakhimovichstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Jingjin Yu and Kostas Bekris	None	None	Object rearrangement is a widely-applicable and challenging task for robots. Geometric constraints must be carefully examined to avoid collisions and combinatorial issues arise as the number of objects increases. This work studies the algorithmic structure of rearranging uniform objects, where robot-object collisions do not occur but object-object collisions have to be avoided. The objective is minimizing the number of object transfers under the assumption that the robot can manipulate one object at a time. An efficiently computable decomposition of the configuration space is used to create a ‚Äúregion graph‚Äù, which classifies all continuous paths of equivalent collision possibilities. Based on this compact but rich representation, a complete dynamic programming primitive ùô≥ùôµùöÇ ùô≥ùôø subscript ùô≥ùôµùöÇ ùô≥ùôø \tt DFS_{DP} typewriter_DFS start_POSTSUBSCRIPT typewriter_DP end_POSTSUBSCRIPT performs a recursive depth first search to solve monotone problems quickly, i.e., those instances that do not require objects to be moved first to an intermediate buffer. ùô≥ùôµùöÇ ùô≥ùôø subscript ùô≥ùôµùöÇ ùô≥ùôø \tt DFS_{DP} typewriter_DFS start_POSTSUBSCRIPT typewriter_DP end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is extended to solve single-buffer, non-monotone instances, given a choice of an object and a buffer. This work utilizes these primitives as local planners in an informed search framework for more general, non-monotone instances. The search utilizes partial solutions from the primitives to identify the most promising choice of objects and buffers. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution returns near-optimal paths with higher success rate, even for challenging non-monotone instances, than other leading alternatives.	
 D3DLO: Deep 3D LiDAR Odometry			None	LiDAR odometry (LO) describes the task of finding an alignment of subsequent LiDAR point clouds. This alignment can be used to estimate the motion of the platform where the LiDAR sensor is mounted on. Currently, on the well-known KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite state-of-the-art algorithms are non-learning approaches. We propose a network architecture that learns LO by directly processing 3D point clouds. It is trained on the KITTI dataset in an end-to-end manner without the necessity of pre-defining corresponding pairs of points. An evaluation on the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite shows similar performance to a previously published work, DeepCLR [ 1 ] , even though our model uses only around 3.56% of the number of network parameters thereof. Furthermore, a plane point extraction is applied which leads to a marginal performance decrease while simultaneously reducing the input size by up to 50%.	
 Non-Newtonian two-phase thin-film problem: Local existence, uniqueness, and stability	Oliver Assenmacher, Gabriele Bruell, Christina Lienstromberg	s6olasse@uni-bonn.de	Oliver Assenmacher:Institute of Applied Mathematics, University of Bonn, Endenicher Allee¬†60, 30167 Bonn, Germany	We study the flow of two immiscible fluids located on a solid bottom, where the lower fluid is Newtonian and the upper fluid is a non-Newtonian Ellis fluid. Neglecting gravitational effects, we consider the formal asymptotic limit of small film heights in the two-phase Navier‚ÄìStokes system. This leads to a strongly coupled system of two parabolic equations of fourth order with merely H√∂lder-continuous dependence on the coefficients. For the case of strictly positive initial film heights we prove local existence of strong solutions by abstract semigroup theory. Uniqueness is proved by energy methods. Under additional regularity assumptions, we investigate asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium solution, which is given by constant film heights.	
 Certifying Numerical Decompositions of Compact Group Representations	Felipe MontealegreMora, Denis Rosset, JeanDaniel Bancal, David Gross	None	None	We present a performant and rigorous algorithm for certifying that a matrix is close to being a projection onto an irreducible subspace of a given group representation. This addresses a problem arising when one seeks solutions to semi-definite programs (SDPs) with a group symmetry. Indeed, in this context, the dimension of the SDP can be significantly reduced if the irreducible representations of the group action are explicitly known. Rigorous numerical algorithms for decomposing a given group representation into irreps are known, but fairly expensive. To avoid this performance problem, existing software packages ‚Äì e.g. RepLAB, which motivated the present work ‚Äì use randomized heuristics. While these seem to work well in practice, the problem of to which extent the results can be trusted arises. Here, we provide rigorous guarantees applicable to finite and compact groups, as well as a software implementation that can interface with RepLAB. Under natural assumptions, a commonly used previous method due to Babai and Friedl runs in time O ( n 5 ) ùëÇ superscript ùëõ 5 O(n^{5}) italic_O ( italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) for n ùëõ n italic_n -dimensional representations. In our approach, the complexity of running both the heuristic decomposition and the certification step is O ( max ‚Å° { n 3 log ‚Å° n , D d 2 log ‚Å° d } ) ùëÇ superscript ùëõ 3 ùëõ ùê∑ superscript ùëë 2 ùëë O(\max\{n^{3}\log n,D\,d^{2}\log d\}) italic_O ( roman_max { italic_n start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_log italic_n , italic_D italic_d start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_log italic_d } ) , where d ùëë d italic_d is the maximum dimension of an irreducible subrepresentation, and D ùê∑ D italic_D is the time required to multiply elements of the group. A reference implementation interfacing with RepLAB is provided.	
 Approachable Free Subsets and Fine Structure Derived Scales11footnote 12010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 03E04, 03E45, 03E55	Dominik Adolf and Omer BenNeria	None	None	Shelah showed that the existence of free subsets over internally approachable subalgebras follows from the failure of the PCF conjecture on intervals of regular cardinals. We show that a stronger property called the Approachable Bounded Subset Property can be forced from the assumption of a cardinal Œª ùúÜ \lambda italic_Œª for which the set of Mitchell orders { o ( Œº ) ‚à£ Œº < Œª } conditional-set ùëú ùúá ùúá ùúÜ \{o(\mu)\mid\mu<\lambda\} { italic_o ( italic_Œº ) ‚à£ italic_Œº < italic_Œª } is unbounded in Œª ùúÜ \lambda italic_Œª . Furthermore, we study the related notion of continuous tree-like scales, and show that such scales must exist on all products in canonical inner models. We use this result, together with a covering-type argument, to show that the large cardinal hypothesis from the forcing part is optimal.	
 Revisiting Non-Specific Syndromic Surveillance	Moritz Kulessa, Eneldo Loza Menca, Johannes Frnkranz	None	None	Infectious disease surveillance is of great importance for the prevention of major outbreaks. Syndromic surveillance aims at developing algorithms which can detect outbreaks as early as possible by monitoring data sources which allow to capture the occurrences of a certain disease. Recent research mainly focuses on the surveillance of specific, known diseases, putting the focus on the definition of the disease pattern under surveillance. Until now, only little effort has been devoted to what we call non-specific syndromic surveillance, i.e., the use of all available data for detecting any kind of outbreaks, including infectious diseases which are unknown beforehand. In this work, we revisit published approaches for non-specific syndromic surveillance and present a set of simple statistical modeling techniques which can serve as benchmarks for more elaborate machine learning approaches. Our experimental comparison on established synthetic data and real data in which we injected synthetic outbreaks shows that these benchmarks already achieve very competitive results and often outperform more elaborate algorithms.	
 Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Vehicular Communication: Joint User Scheduling and Passive Beamforming	Ahmed AlHilo, Moataz Samir, Mohamed Elhattab, Chadi Assi, and Sanaa Sharafeddine	None	None	Given its ability to control and manipulate wireless environments, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), also known as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), has emerged as a key enabler technology for the six-generation (6G) cellular networks. In the meantime, vehicular environment radio propagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause transmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted to explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications while considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment. Specifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS to provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark zones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links are blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is utilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles passing through out-of-service zones. Therefore, the joint problem of RSU resource scheduling and RIS passive beamforming or phase-shift matrix is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum average bit rate. The formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex program which is difficult to be solved and does not account for the uncertain dynamic environment in vehicular networks. Thereby, we resort to alternative methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to determine RSU wireless scheduling and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to solve for the phase-shift matrix, i.e., passive beamforming, of the RIS. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined and the complexity of the solution approach is discussed. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over baseline techniques.

We also use the stochastic gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits derived from the O3 data to constrain the cosmic string tension, G Œº ùê∫ ùúá G\mu italic_G italic_Œº , as a function of the number of kinks, or the number of cusps, for two cosmic string loop distribution models.

 A Survey of Complex-Valued Neural Networks	JoshuaBassey,Xiangfang Li,Lijun Qian	None	None	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) based machine learning models and especially deep learning models have been widely applied in computer vision, signal processing, wireless communications, and many other domains, where complex numbers occur either naturally or by design. However, most of the current implementations of ANNs and machine learning frameworks are using real numbers rather than complex numbers. There are growing interests in building ANNs using complex numbers, and exploring the potential advantages of the so called complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) over their real-valued counterparts. In this paper, we discuss the recent development of CVNNs by performing a survey of the works on CVNNs in the literature. Specifically, detailed review of various CVNNs in terms of activation function, learning and optimization, input and output representations, and their applications in tasks such as signal processing and computer vision are provided, followed by a discussion on some pertinent challenges and future research directions.

 Finite-temperature, Anharmonicity, and Duschinsky Effects on the Two-dimensional Electronic Spectra from Ab Initio Thermo-field Gaussian Wavepacket Dynamics	Tomislav Begui, Ji Vanek	tomislav.begusic@epfl.ch	None	Accurate description of finite-temperature vibrational dynamics is indispensable in the computation of two-dimensional electronic spectra. Such simulations are often based on the density matrix evolution, statistical averaging of initial vibrational states, or approximate classical or semiclassical limits. While many practical approaches exist, they are often of limited accuracy and difficult to interpret. Here, we use the concept of thermo-field dynamics to derive an exact finite-temperature expression that lends itself to an intuitive wavepacket-based interpretation. Furthermore, an efficient method for computing finite-temperature two-dimensional spectra is obtained by combining the exact thermo-field dynamics approach with the thawed Gaussian approximation for the wavepacket dynamics, which is exact for any displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic potential but also accounts partially for anharmonicity effects in general potentials. Using this new method, we directly relate a symmetry breaking of the two-dimensional signal to the deviation from the conventional Brownian oscillator picture.

By solving the associated Cauchy problem, the adiabatic paths are confined to the non-extremal manifold, and therefore, the status of the second and third laws are preserved. Consequently, the extremal sub-manifold corresponds to the adiabatically disconnected boundary of the manifold. In addition, the merger of two extremal Hayward black holes is analyzed.	
 Reliable COVID-19 Detection using Chest X-Ray Images			None	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.	
 Hybrid leg compliance enables robots to operate with sensorimotor delays and low control update frequencies	Milad Shafiee AshtianiddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alborz Aghamaleki SarvestaniddaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTand Alexander BadriSprwitzstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None		Animals locomote robustly and agile, albeit significant sensorimotor delays of their nervous system. The sensorimotor control of legged robots is implemented with much higher frequencies‚Äî often in the kilohertz range‚Äîand sensor and actuator delays in the low millisecond range. But especially at harsh impacts with unknown touch-down timing, legged robots show unstable controller behaviors, while animals are seemingly not impacted. Here we examine this discrepancy and suggest a hybrid robotic leg and controller design. We implemented a physical, parallel joint compliance dimensioned in combination with an active, virtual leg length controller. We present an extensive set of systematic experiments both in computer simulation and hardware. Our hybrid leg and controller design shows previously unseen robustness, in the presence of sensorimotor delays up to 60 ms, or control frequencies as low as 20 Hz, for a drop landing task from 1.3 leg lengths high and with a passive compliance ratio of 0.7. In computer simulations, we report successful drop-landings of the hybrid compliant leg from 3.8 leg lengths (1.2 m) for a 2 kg quadruped robot with 100 Hz control frequency and a sensorimotor delay of 35 ms. The results of our presented hybrid leg design and control provide a further explanation for the performance robustness of animals, and the resulting discrepancy between animals and legged robots. \helveticabold	
 1 Introduction			None	Relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREAs) imply a large multiplication of high energy electrons ( ‚àº similar-to \sim ‚àº 1 MeV). Two factors are necessary for this phenomenon: a high electric field sustained over a large distance and an energetic particle to serve as a seed. The former sustains particle energies as they keep colliding and lose energy randomly; and the latter serves as a multiplication starting point that promotes avalanches. RREA is usually connected to both terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) and gamma-ray glows (also known as Thunderstorm Ground Enhancement (TGE) when detected at ground level) as possible generation mechanism of both events, but the current knowledge does not provide a clear relationship between these events (TGF and TGE), beyond their possible common source mechanism, still as they have different characteristics. In particular, their timescales differ by several orders of magnitude. This work shows that chain reactions by TGF byproducts can continue for the timescale of gamma-ray glows and even provide energetic particles as seeds for RREAs of gamma-ray glows.	
 1 Introduction			None	We present an algorithm for constructing analytically approximate integrals of motion in simple time periodic Hamiltonians of the form H = H 0 + Œµ H i ùêª subscript ùêª 0 ùúÄ subscript ùêª ùëñ H=H_{0}+\varepsilon H_{i} italic_H = italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_Œµ italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , where Œµ ùúÄ \varepsilon italic_Œµ is a perturbation parameter. We apply our algorithm in a Hamiltonian system whose dynamics is governed by the Mathieu equation and examine in detail the orbits and their stroboscopic invariant curves for different values of Œµ ùúÄ \varepsilon italic_Œµ . We find the values of Œµ c r i t subscript ùúÄ ùëê ùëü ùëñ ùë° \varepsilon_{crit} italic_Œµ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c italic_r italic_i italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT beyond which the orbits escape to infinity and construct integrals which are expressed as series in the perturbation Œµ ùúÄ \varepsilon italic_Œµ and converge up to Œµ c r i t subscript ùúÄ ùëê ùëü ùëñ ùë° \varepsilon_{crit} italic_Œµ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c italic_r italic_i italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . In the absence of resonances the invariant curves are concentric ellipses which are approximated very well by our integrals. Finally we construct an integral of motion which describes the hyperbolic stroboscopic invariant curve of a resonant case.	
 Microswimmers learning chemotaxis with genetic algorithms	Benedikt Hartl, Maximilian Hbl, Gerhard Kahl, Andreas Zttl	None	None	Various microorganisms and some mammalian cells are able to swim in viscous fluids by performing nonreciprocal body deformations, such as rotating attached flagella or by distorting their entire body. In order to perform chemotaxis, i.e. to move towards and to stay at high concentrations of nutrients, they adapt their swimming gaits in a nontrivial manner. We propose a model how microswimmers are able to autonomously adapt their shape in order to swim in one dimension towards high field concentrations using an internal decision making machinery modeled by an artificial neural network. We present two methods to measure chemical gradients, spatial and temporal sensing, as known for swimming mammalian cells and bacteria, respectively. Using the NEAT genetic algorithm surprisingly simple neural networks evolve which control the shape deformations of the microswimmer and allow them to navigate in static and complex time-dependent chemical environments. By introducing noisy signal transmission in the neural network the well-known biased run-and-tumble motion emerges. Our work demonstrates that the evolution of a simple internal decision-making machinery, which we can fully interpret and is coupled to the environment, allows navigation in diverse chemical landscapes. These findings are of relevance for intracellular biochemical sensing mechanisms of single cells, or for the simple nervous system of small multicellular organisms such as C. elegans .

We use work of Ikeda with an observation of Adams-Reid to show that every 3 3 3 3 ‚Äìmanifold subject to the above conditions contains a hyperbolic knot which admits a non-trivial non-hyperbolic surgery, a toroidal surgery in particular. We conclude with a question and a conjecture about reducible surgeries.	
 Feedback in Forming Star Clusters: The Mass-Radius Relation and Mass Function of Molecular Clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud	Angus Mok, Rupali Chandar, Michael Fall	None	None	We derive the mass-radius relation and mass function of molecular clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and interpret them in terms of the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner (FKM). Our work utilizes the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. from 12 12 {}^{12} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO and 13 13 {}^{13} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT CO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The Magellanic Clouds are the only external galaxies for which this type of analysis is possible at the necessary spatial resolution ( ‚àº 1 similar-to absent 1 \sim 1 ‚àº 1 pc).

With these values of Œ± ùõº \alpha italic_Œ± and Œ≤ ùõΩ \beta italic_Œ≤ for the clumps (i.e., protoclusters), the predicted index for the mass function of young LMC clusters from the FKM model is Œ≤ ‚âà 1.7 ùõΩ 1.7 \beta\approx 1.7 italic_Œ≤ ‚âà 1.7 , in good agreement with the observed index.

Finally, we compare predictions for the galaxy‚Äìgalaxy lensing amplitude of the two samples against measurements from SDSS and assess the lensing-is-low effect in light of our findings.	
 Measuring non-exchangeable tail dependence using tail copulas	Takaaki Koike, Shogo Kato, Marius Hofert	None	None	Quantifying tail dependence is an important issue in insurance and risk management. The prevalent tail dependence coefficient (TDC), however, is known to underestimate the degree of tail dependence and it does not capture non-exchangeable tail dependence since it evaluates the limiting tail probability only along the main diagonal. To overcome these issues, two novel tail dependence measures called the maximal tail concordance measure (MTCM) and the average tail concordance measure (ATCM) are proposed. Both measures are constructed based on tail copulas and possess clear probabilistic interpretations in that the MTCM evaluates the largest limiting probability among all comparable rectangles in the tail, and the ATCM is a normalized average of these limiting probabilities. In contrast to the TDC, the proposed measures can capture non-exchangeable tail dependence. Moreover, they often admit analytical forms and satisfy axiomatic properties naturally required to quantify tail dependence.

 Detecting violations of macrorealism when the original Leggett-Garg inequalities are satisfied	Shayan Majidy, Jonathan Halliwell, Raymond Laflamme	smajidy@uwaterloo.ca	None	Macroscopic realism (MR) is the notion that a time-evolving system possesses definite properties, irrespective of past or future measurements. Quantum mechanical theories can, however, produce violations of MR. Most research to date has focused on a single set of conditions for MR, the Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGIs), and on a single data set, the ‚Äústandard data set‚Äù, which consists of single-time averages and second-order correlators of a dichotomic variable Q for three times. However, if such conditions are all satisfied, then where is the quantum behavior? In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by considering expanded data sets obtained from finer-grained measurements and MR conditions on those sets. We consider three different situations in which there are violations of MR that go undetected by the standard LGIs. First, we explore higher-order LGIs on a data set involving third- and fourth-order correlators, using a spin-1/2 and spin-1 system. Second, we explore the pentagon inequalities (PIs) and a data set consisting of all possible averages and second-order correlators for measurements of Q at five times. Third, we explore the LGIs for a trichotomic variable and measurements made with a trichotomic operator to, again, identify violations for a spin-1 system beyond those seen with a single dichotomic variable. We also explore the regimes in which combinations of two and three-time LGIs can be satisfied and violated in a spin-1 system, extending recent work. We discuss the possible experimental implementation of all the above results.	
 A Bayesian Model of Cash Bail Decisions	Joshua Williams, Zico Kolter	None	None	The use of cash bail as a mechanism for detaining defendants pre-trial is an often-criticized system that many have argued violates the presumption of ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty.‚Äù Many studies have sought to understand both the long-term effects of cash bail‚Äôs use and the disparate rate of cash bail assignments along demographic lines (race, gender, etc). However, such work is often susceptible to problems of infra-marginality ‚Äì that the data we observe can only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated with the marginal decision. In this work, we address this problem by creating a hierarchical Bayesian model of cash bail assignments. Specifically, our approach models cash bail decisions as a probabilistic process whereby judges balance the relative costs of assigning cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court dates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon features of the individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference to sample the distribution over these costs for different magistrates and across different races. We fit this model to a data set we have collected of over 50,000 court cases in the Allegheny and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania. Our analysis of 50 separate judges shows that they are uniformly more likely to assign cash bail to black defendants than to white defendants, even given identical likelihood of skipping a court appearance. This analysis raises further questions about the equity of the practice of cash bail, irrespective of its underlying legal justification.

 Prospects for Detecting Gravitational Waves from Eccentric Subsolar Mass Compact Binaries	YiFan Wang, Alexander Nitz	None	None	Due to their small mass, subsolar mass black hole binaries would have to be primordial in origin instead of the result of stellar evolution. Soon after formation in the early universe, primordial black holes can form binaries after decoupling from the cosmic expansion. Alternatively, primordial black holes as dark matter could also form binaries in the late universe due to dynamical encounters and gravitational-wave braking. A significant feature for this channel is the possibility that some sources retain nonzero eccentricity in the LIGO/Virgo band. Assuming all dark matter is primordial black holes with a delta function mass distribution, 1 M ‚äô ‚àí 1 M ‚äô 1 subscript ùëÄ direct-product 1 subscript ùëÄ direct-product 1M_{\odot}-1M_{\odot} 1 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 1 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT binaries formed in this late-universe channel can be detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo with their design sensitivities at a rate of ùí™ ( 1 ) ùí™ 1 \mathcal{O}(1) caligraphic_O ( 1 ) /year, where 12 % ( 3 % ) percent 12 percent 3 12\%(3\%) 12 % ( 3 % ) of events have eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz, e 10 H z ‚â• 0.01 ( 0.1 ) superscript ùëí 10 H z 0.01 0.1 e^{\mathrm{10Hz}}\geq 0.01(0.1) italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 roman_H roman_z end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚â• 0.01 ( 0.1 ) , and nondetection can constrain the binary formation rate within this model.

 1 Introduction			None	In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.

 Stochastic social behavior coupled to COVID-19 dynamics leads to waves, plateaus and an endemic state	Alexei TkachenkodaggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Sergei Maslov,,,,daggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Tong Wang,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Ahmed ElbannastartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, George NWongstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Nigel Goldenfeld,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	It is well recognized that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the spread of epidemics. While individual variations in social activity are often assumed to be persistent, i.e. constant in time, here we discuss the consequences of dynamic heterogeneity. By integrating the stochastic dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models we demonstrate the emergence of a new long timescale governing the epidemic in broad agreement with empirical data. Our model captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and multiple waves, which are transiently suppressed due to the dynamic nature of social activity. The existence of the long timescale due to the interplay between epidemic and social dynamics provides a unifying picture of how a fast-paced epidemic typically will transition to the endemic state.	
 A Causal Convolutional Neural Network for Motion Modeling and Synthesis	Shuaiying HouZhejiang UniversityChinaWeiwei XuZhejiang UniversityChinaJinxiang ChaiTexa AM UniversityUSACongyi WangXmovChinaWenlin ZhuangSoutheast UniversityChinaYu ChenXmovChinaHujun BaoZhejiang UniversityChinaYangang WangSoutheast UniversityChina	None	None	We propose a novel deep generative model based on causal convolutions for multi-subject motion modeling and synthesis, which is inspired by the success of WaveNet in multi-subject speech synthesis. However, it is nontrivial to adapt WaveNet to handle high-dimensional and physically constrained motion data. To this end, we add an encoder and a decoder to the WaveNet to translate the motion data into features and back to the predicted motions. We also add 1D convolution layers to take skeleton configuration as an input to model skeleton variations across different subjects. As a result, our network can scale up well to large-scale motion data sets across multiple subjects and support various applications, such as random and controllable motion synthesis, motion denoising, and motion completion, in a unified way. Complex motions, such as punching, kicking and, kicking while punching, are also well handled. Moreover, our network can synthesize motions for novel skeletons not in the training dataset. After fine-tuning the network with a few motion data of the novel skeleton, it is able to capture the personalized style implied in the motion and generate high-quality motions for the skeleton. Thus, it has the potential to be used as a pre-trained network in few-shot learning for motion modeling and synthesis. Experimental results show that our model can effectively handle the variation of skeleton configurations, and it runs fast to synthesize different types of motions on-line. We also perform user studies to verify that the quality of motions generated by our network is superior to the motions of state-of-the-art human motion synthesis methods.

The second implements a constant time lag model for tides without evolving spins. We demonstrate various uses of these features using stellar evolution data from MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) as an example. The results of our tests agree with several studies in the literature on post-main sequence orbital evolution, and our convergence and performance studies respectively demonstrate our implementations‚Äô accuracy and efficiency.

 GF-Flush: A GF(2) Algebraic Attack on Secure Scan Chains	DakeChen, ChunxiaoLin,PeterABeerel	None	None	Scan chains provide increased controllability and observability for testing digital circuits. The increased testability, however, can also be a source of information leakage for sensitive designs. The state-of-the-art defenses to secure scan chains apply dynamic keys to pseudo-randomly invert the scan vectors. In this paper, we pinpoint an algebraic vulnerability of these dynamic defenses that involves creating and solving a system of linear equations over the finite field GF(2). In particular, we propose a novel GF(2)-based flush attack that breaks even the most rigorous version of state-of-the-art dynamic defenses. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack recovers the key as long as 500 bits in less than 7 seconds, the attack times are about one hundredth of state-of-the-art SAT based attacks on the same defenses. We then demonstrate how our attacks can be extended to scan chains compressed with Multiple-Input Signature Registers (MISRs).	
 On the Degeneracy of Spin Ice Graphs, and Its Estimate via the Bethe Permanent	Francesco Caravelli, Michael Saccone, Cristiano Nisoli	None	None	The concept of spin ice can be extended to a general graph. We study the degeneracy of spin ice graph on arbitrary interaction structures via graph theory. Via the mapping of spin ices to the Ising model, we clarify whether the inverse mapping is possible via a modified Krausz construction. From the gauge freedom of frustrated Ising systems, we derive exact, general results about frustration and degeneracy. We demonstrate for the first time that every spin ice graph, with the exception of the 1D Ising model, is degenerate. We then study how degeneracy scales in size, using the mapping between Eulerian trails and spin ice manifolds, and a permanental identity for the number of Eulerian orientations. We show that the Bethe permanent technique provides both an estimate and a lower bound to the frustration of spin ices on arbitrary graphs of even degree. While such technique can be used also to obtain an upper bound, we find that in all the examples we studied but one, another upper bound based on Schrijver inequality is tighter.

 Simple Adaptive Estimation of Quadratic Functionals in Nonparametric IV ModelsWe are grateful to Volodia Spokoiny for his friendship and insightful comments, and admire his creativity and high standard on research.

Early versions have been presented at the conference ‚ÄúCelebrating Whitney Newey‚Äôs Contributions to Econometrics‚Äù at MIT in May 2019, the North American Summer Meeting of the Econometric Society in Seattle in June 2019, and the conference ‚ÄúFoundations of Modern Statistics‚Äù in occasion of Volodia Spokoiny‚Äôs 60th birthday at WIAS in November 2019.	, 	None	None	This paper considers adaptive, minimax estimation of a quadratic functional in a nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) model, which is an important problem in optimal estimation of a nonlinear functional of an ill-posed inverse regression with an unknown operator. We first show that a leave-one-out, sieve NPIV estimator of the quadratic functional can attain a convergence rate that coincides with the lower bound previously derived in Chen and Christensen [ 2018 ] . The minimax rate is achieved by the optimal choice of the sieve dimension (a key tuning parameter) that depends on the smoothness of the NPIV function and the degree of ill-posedness, both are unknown in practice. We next propose a Lepski-type data-driven choice of the key sieve dimension adaptive to the unknown NPIV model features. The adaptive estimator of the quadratic functional is shown to attain the minimax optimal rate in the severely ill-posed case and in the regular mildly ill-posed case, but up to a multiplicative log ‚Å° n ùëõ \sqrt{\log n} square-root start_ARG roman_log italic_n end_ARG factor in the irregular mildly ill-posed case.

 Semiparametric point process modeling of blinking artifacts in PALM	Louis JensenDepartment of MathematicsAarhus UniversityAarhus CDenmarkDavid WilliamsonRandall Division for Cell and Molecular BiophysicsKings College LondonLondonUKUte HahnDepartment of MathematicsAarhus UniversityAarhus CDenmark	None	None	Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) is a powerful imaging technique for characterization of protein organization in biological cells. Due to the stochastic blinking of fluorescent probes, and camera discretization effects, each protein gives rise to a cluster of artificial observations. These blinking artifacts are an obstacle for quantitative analysis of PALM data, and tools for their correction are in high demand. We develop the Independent Blinking Cluster point process (IBCpp) family of models, which is suited for modeling of data from single-molecule localization microscopy modalities, and we present results on the mark correlation function. We then construct the PALM-IBCpp - a semiparametric IBCpp tailored for PALM data, and we describe a procedure for estimation of parameters, which can be used without parametric assumptions on the spatial organization of proteins. Our model is validated on nuclear pore complex reference data, where the ground truth was accurately recovered, and we demonstrate how the estimated blinking parameters can be used to perform a blinking corrected test for protein clustering in a cell expressing the adaptor protein LAT. Finally, we consider simulations with varying degrees of blinking and protein clustering to shed light on the expected performance in a range of realistic settings.

 Universal field dependence of magnetic resonance near zero frequency	Yuan, Rembert Duine	None	None	Magnetic resonance is a widely-established phenomenon that probes magnetic properties such as magnetic damping and anisotropy. Even though the typical resonance frequency of a magnet ranges from gigahertz to terahertz, experiments also report the resonance near zero frequency in a large class of magnets. Here we revisit this phenomenon by analyzing the symmetry of the system and find that the resonance frequency ( œâ ùúî \omega italic_œâ ) follows a universal power law œâ ‚àù | H ‚àí H c | p proportional-to ùúî superscript ùêª subscript ùêª ùëê ùëù \omega\varpropto|H-H_{c}|^{p} italic_œâ ‚àù | italic_H - italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_p end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , where H c subscript ùêª ùëê H_{c} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the critical field at which the resonance frequency is zero. When the magnet preserves the rotational symmetry around the external field ( H ùêª H italic_H ), p = 1 ùëù 1 p=1 italic_p = 1 . Otherwise, p = 1 / 2 ùëù 1 2 p=1/2 italic_p = 1 / 2 . The magnon excitations are gapped above H c subscript ùêª ùëê H_{c} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , gapless at H c subscript ùêª ùëê H_{c} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and gapped again below H c subscript ùêª ùëê H_{c} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_c end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . The zero frequency is often accompanied by a reorientation transition in the magnetization. For the case that p = 1 / 2 ùëù 1 2 p=1/2 italic_p = 1 / 2 , this transition is described by a Landau theory for second-order phase transitions. We further show that the spin current driven by thermal gradient and spin-orbit effects can be significantly enhanced when the resonance frequency is close to zero, which can be measured electrically by converting the spin current into electric signals. This may provide an experimentally accessible way to characterize the critical field. Our findings provide a unified understanding of the magnetization dynamics near the critical field, and may, furthermore, inspire the study of magnon transport near magnetic transitions.	
 Jones Matrix Characterization of Optical Elements via Evolutionary Algorithms	Alejandra DeLunaPamanes, Edgar Covantes Osuna, Dorilian LopezMago	A01281001@itesm.mx	None	Abstract ‚ÄîJones calculus provides a robust and straightforward method to characterize polarized light and polarizing optical systems using two-element vectors (Jones vectors) and 2 √ó 2 2 2 2\times 2 2 √ó 2 matrices (Jones matrices). Jones matrices are used to determine the retardance and diattenuation introduced by an optical element or a sequence of elements. Moreover, they are the tool of choice to study optical geometric phases. However, the current sampling method for characterizing the Jones matrix of an optical element is inefficient, since the search space of the problem is in the realm of the real numbers and so applying a general sampling method is time-consuming. In this study, we present an initial approach for solving the problem of finding the eigenvectors that characterize the Jones matrix of a homogeneous optical element through Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). We evaluate the analytical performance of an EA with a Polynomial Mutation operator and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Simulated Binary crossover operator and a Polynomial Mutation operator, and compare the results with those obtained through a general sampling method. The results show that both the EA and the GA out-performed a general sampling method of 6,000 measurements, by requiring in average 103 and 188 fitness functions measurements respectively, while having a perfect rate of convergence.	
 Combining pre-trained language models and structured knowledge	Pedro ColonHernandez, Catherine Havasi, Jason Alonso, Matthew Huggins, Cynthia Breazeal	None	None	In recent years, transformer-based language models have achieved state of the art performance in various NLP benchmarks. These models are able to extract mostly distributional information with some semantics from unstructured text, however it has proven challenging to integrate structured information, such as knowledge graphs into these models. We examine a variety of approaches to integrate structured knowledge into current language models and determine challenges, and possible opportunities to leverage both structured and unstructured information sources. From our survey, we find that there are still opportunities at exploiting adapter-based injections and that it may be possible to further combine various of the explored approaches into one system.	
 Spectral ùúª-Functions and ùúª-Regularized Functional Determinants for Regular Sturm‚ÄìLiouville Operators	Guglielmo Fucci, Fritz Gesztesy, Klaus Kirsten, Jonathan Stanfill	fuccig@ecu.edu	"Department of Mathematics,
East Carolina University, 331 Austin Building, East Fifth Street,
Greenville, NC 27858-4353, USA"	The principal aim in this paper is to employ a recently developed unified approach to the computation of traces of resolvents and Œ∂ ùúÅ \zeta italic_Œ∂ -functions to efficiently compute values of spectral Œ∂ ùúÅ \zeta italic_Œ∂ -functions at positive integers associated to regular (three-coefficient) self-adjoint Sturm‚ÄìLiouville differential expressions œÑ ùúè \tau italic_œÑ .

Furthermore, we give the full analytic continuation of the Œ∂ ùúÅ \zeta italic_Œ∂ -function through a Liouville transformation and provide an explicit expression for the Œ∂ ùúÅ \zeta italic_Œ∂ -regularized functional determinant in terms of a particular set of this fundamental system of solutions.

 Growth and Collapse of an Isolated Bubble Driven by a Single Negative Histotripsy Cycle in Agarose Gel: Stress, Strain, and Strain Rate Fields	LaurenMancia,JonathanRSukovich,ZhenXu,andEricJohnsen	None	None	Histotripsy relies on cavitation to mechanically homogenize soft tissue. There is strong evidence that the high stresses, strains, and strain rates developed as bubbles grow and collapse contribute to this tissue homogenization. While such stresses and strains have been examined computationally in model systems with assumed constitutive models (e.g., finite-deformation Neo-Hookean model) and viscoelastic properties determined under quasi-static conditions, recent studies proposed that the Quadratic Law Kelvin-Voigt (QLKV) constitutive model, which additionally accounts for strain stiffening, more accurately represents the viscoelastic response of soft materials subjected to cavitation; this model has also been used to infer viscoelastic properties at high rates. In this work, we use the QLKV model and these properties to calculate the time-dependent stress, strain, and strain rate fields produced during the growth and collapse of individual bubbles subjected to a histotripsy-relevant pressure waveform in agarose gels of 0.3 % and 1.0 % concentration and corresponding to actual (past) experiments. We find that, as the gel concentration is increased, strain stiffening manifests in larger elastic stresses and compressive stresses extending into the collapse phase, particularly for the 1.0 % concentration gel. As a result, the duration of the collapse phase also increases. In comparison with the conventional Neo-Hookean model, the compressive stress has a larger magnitude, extends farther into the surrounding medium, and shows an increased departure from growth/collapse symmetry close to the bubble; all of these effects are magnified in the stiffer gel.	
 Atomic Clocks in Space: A Search for Rubidium and Cesium Masers in M- and L-Dwarfs	Jeremy Darling	None	None	I searched for the ground state 6.8 and 9.2 GHz hyperfine transitions of rubidium and cesium toward M- and L-dwarfs that show Rb and Cs optical resonance lines. The optical lines can pump the hyperfine transitions, potentially forming masers. These spin-flip transitions of Rb and Cs are the principal transitions used in atomic clocks (the 133 133 {}^{133} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 133 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Cs hyperfine transition defines the second). If they are detected in stellar atmospheres, these transitions would provide exceptionally precise clocks that can be used as accelerometers, as exoplanet detectors, as probes of the predictions of general relativity, as probes of light propagation effects, and as a means to do fundamental physics with telescopes. Observations of 21 M- and L-dwarfs, however, show no evidence for Rb or Cs maser action, and a previous survey of giant stars made no Rb maser detections.	
 Putting gradual types to work	Bhargav Shivkumar, Enrique Naudon, Lukasz Ziarek	None	None	In this paper, we describe our experience incorporating gradual types in a statically typed functional language with Hindley-Milner style type inference. Where most gradually typed systems aim to improve static checking in a dynamically typed language, we approach it from the opposite perspective and promote dynamic checking in a statically typed language. Our approach provides a glimpse into how languages like SML and OCaml might handle gradual typing. We discuss our implementation and challenges faced‚Äîspecifically how gradual typing rules apply to our representation of composite and recursive types. We review the various implementations that add dynamic typing to a statically typed language in order to highlight the different ways of mixing static and dynamic typing and examine possible inspirations while maintaining the gradual nature of our type system. This paper also discusses our motivation for adding gradual types to our language, and the practical benefits of doing so in our industrial setting.

 Strong Field Ionization of Water: Nuclear Dynamics Revealed by Varying the Pulse Duration	Howard, Cheng, Forbes, McCracken, Mills, Makhija, Spanner, Weinacht, Bucksbaum	None	None	Polyatomic molecules in strong laser fields can undergo substantial nuclear motion within tens of femtoseconds. Ion imaging methods based on dissociation or Coulomb explosion therefore have difficulty faithfully recording the geometry dependence of the field ionization that initiates the dissociation process. Here we compare the strong-field double ionization and subsequent dissociation of water (both H 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O and D 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT O) in 10-fs and 40-fs 800-nm laser pulses. We find that 10-fs pulses turn off before substantial internuclear motion occurs, whereas rapid internuclear motion can take place during the double ionization process for 40-fs pulses. The short-pulse measurements are consistent with a simple tunnel ionization picture, whose predictions help interpret the motion observed in the long-pulse measurements.	
 Existence and Uniqueness for non-Markovian Triangular Quadratic BSDEs	Joe Jackson and Gordan itkovi	None	None	We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a class of quadratic BSDE systems which we call triangular quadratic. Our results generalize several existing results about diagonally quadratic BSDEs in the non-Markovian setting. As part of our analysis, we obtain new results about linear BSDEs with unbounded coefficients, which may be of independent interest. Through a non-uniqueness example, we answer a ‚Äúcrucial open question‚Äù raised by Harter and Richou by showing that the stochastic exponential of an n √ó n ùëõ ùëõ n\times n italic_n √ó italic_n matrix-valued BMO martingale need not satisfy a reverse H√∂lder inequality.

 New Formulations of Ambiguous Volatility with an Application to Optimal Dynamic Contracting1footnote 11footnote 1I acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Anne Balter, Hui Chen, Sharada Dharmasankar, Leonid Kogan, Andrey Malenko, Jianjun Miao, Jian Sun, Xiangyu Zhang, three anonymous referees, and participants at the MIT Finance lunch seminar and the Becker Friedman Institute mini-conference on Ambiguity and Robustness. I am especially grateful to Lars Hansen, Andrey Malenko, and Tom Sargent (editor) for their support and feedback which greatly improved the paper.	Peter Hansen	None	None	I introduce novel preference formulations which capture aversion to ambiguity about unknown and potentially time-varying volatility. I compare these preferences with Gilboa and Schmeidler‚Äôs maxmin expected utility as well as variational formulations of ambiguity aversion. The impact of ambiguity aversion is illustrated in a simple static model of portfolio choice, as well as a dynamic model of optimal contracting under repeated moral hazard. Implications for investor beliefs, optimal design of corporate securities, and asset pricing are explored.	
 Magnetoresistive Sensor Detectivity: A Comparative Analysis	Davies, Watts, Novotny, Huang, Eames	jdavies@nve.com	None	We report on the noise performance characteristics of magnetic sensors using both magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) elements. Each sensor studied has a notably different noise and detectivity. Of the sensors we measured, those based on GMR multilayers have the lowest noise and detectivity. However, the GMR sensor also has a significantly smaller linear range. To make a direct comparison between sensors we scale the linear operating ranges of each sensor to be the same. This is the phenomenological equivalent of modifying the flux concentration. Upon scaling the low frequency detectivity of the TMR sensors becomes essentially equal to that of the GMR sensor. Using the scaling approach we are able to place the detectivity in the context of other key parameters, namely size and power consumption. Lastly, we use this technique to examine the upper limit for magnetoresistive sensor performance based on a notional MTJ sensor using present record setting TMR values.

 Observation of the Decrease of Larmor Tunneling Times with Lower Incident Energy	David Spierings, Aephraim Steinberg	dspierin@physics.utoronto.ca	None	How much time does a tunneling particle spend in a barrier? A Larmor clock, one proposal to answer this question, measures the interaction between the particle and the barrier region using an auxiliary degree of freedom of the particle to clock the dwell time inside the barrier. We report on precise Larmor time measurements of ultra-cold 87 87 {}^{87} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 87 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT Rb atoms tunneling through an optical barrier, which confirm longstanding predictions of tunneling times. We observe that atoms generally spend less time tunneling through higher barriers and that this time decreases for lower energy particles.

 Hamiltonian Gotay-Nester-Hinds analysis of the parametrized unimodular extension of the Holst action	Fernando Barbero, Bogar Daz, Juan MargalefBentabol, and Eduardo Villaseor	None	None	We give a detailed account of the Hamiltonian GNH analysis of the parametrized unimodular extension of the Holst action. The purpose of the paper is to derive, through the clear geometric picture furnished by the GNH method, a simple Hamiltonian formulation for this model and explain why it is difficult to arrive at it in other approaches. We will also show how to take advantage of the field equations to anticipate the simple form of the constraints that we find in the paper.

 Third-order ladder operators, generalized Okamoto and exceptional orthogonal polynomials	Hussin, Marquette, Zelaya	None	None	We extend and generalize the construction of Sturm-Liouville problems for a family of Hamiltonians constrained to fulfill a third-order shape-invariance condition and focusing on the ‚Äú ‚àí 2 x / 3 2 ùë• 3 -2x/3 - 2 italic_x / 3 ‚Äù hierarchy of solutions to the fourth Painlev√© transcendent. Such a construction has been previously addressed in the literature for some particular cases but we realize it here in the most general case. The corresponding potential in the Hamiltonian operator is a rationally extended oscillator defined in terms of the conventional Okamoto polynomials, from which we identify three different zero-modes constructed in terms of the generalized Okamoto polynomials. The third-order ladder operators of the system reveal that the complete set of eigenfunctions is decomposed as a union of three disjoint sequences of solutions, generated from a set of three-term recurrence relations. We also identify a link between the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian operator and a special family of exceptional Hermite polynomial.	
 Fourier multipliers for Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on compact Lie groups	Duvn Cardona, Michael Ruzhansky	None	"Duv√°n Cardona S√°nchez:

 Phase transitions in GLSMs and defects	Ilka Brunner, Fabian Klos, Daniel Roggenkamp	None	None	In this paper, we construct defects (domain walls) that connect different phases of two-dimensional gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs), as well as defects that embed those phases into the GLSMs. Via their action on boundary conditions these defects give rise to functors between the D-brane categories, which respectively describe the transport of D-branes between different phases, and embed the D-brane categories of the phases into the category of D-branes of the GLSMs.	
 Byzantine Fault-Tolerance in Peer-to-Peer Distributed Gradient-Descent	Nirupam Gupta Nitin Vaidya	None	None	We consider the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in the peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed gradient-descent method ‚Äì a prominent algorithm for distributed optimization in a P2P system. In this problem, the system comprises of multiple agents, and each agent has a local cost function. In the fault-free case, when all the agents are honest, the P2P distributed gradient-descent method allows all the agents to reach a consensus on a solution that minimizes their aggregate cost. However, we consider a scenario where a certain number of agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow an algorithm correctly, and may share arbitrary incorrect information to prevent other non-faulty agents from solving the optimization problem.	
 Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos algorithm for inverse scattering problems	Druskin, Moskowand Zaslavsky	None	None	Data-driven reduced order models (ROMs) are combined with the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation to produce a direct nonlinear inversion method. The ROM is viewed as a Galerkin projection and is sparse due to Lanczos orthogonalization. Embedding into the continuous problem, a data-driven internal solution is produced. This internal solution is then used in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, thus making further iterative updates unnecessary. We show numerical experiments for spectral domain domain data for which our inversion is far superior to the Born inversion and works as well as when the true internal solution is known.	
 Experimentation for homogeneous policy change	Molly OfferWestortDrew Dimmery	None	None	When the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is violated and there is interference among units, there is not a uniquely defined Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and alternative estimands may be of interest, among them average unit-level differences in outcomes under different homogeneous treatment policies. We term this target the Homogeneous Assignment Average Treatment Effect (HAATE). We consider approaches to experimental design with multiple treatment conditions under partial interference and, given the estimand of interest, we show that difference-in-means estimators may perform better than correctly specified regression models in finite samples on root mean squared error (RMSE). With errors correlated at the cluster level, we demonstrate that two-stage randomization procedures with intra-cluster correlation of treatment strictly between zero and one may dominate one-stage randomization designs on the same metric. Simulations demonstrate performance of this approach; an application to online experiments at Facebook is discussed.	
 General conditions for universality of Quantum Hamiltonians	Tamara Kohler, Stephen Piddock, Johannes Bausch, Toby Cubitt	None	None	Recent work has demonstrated the existence of universal Hamiltonians ‚Äì simple spin lattice models that can simulate any other quantum many body system to any desired level of accuracy. Until now proofs of universality have relied on explicit constructions, tailored to each specific family of universal Hamiltonians. In this work we go beyond this approach, and completely classify the simulation ability of quantum Hamiltonians by their complexity classes. We do this by deriving necessary and sufficient complexity theoretic conditions characterising universal quantum Hamiltonians. Although the result concerns the theory of analogue Hamiltonian simulation ‚Äì a promising application of near-term quantum technology ‚Äì the proof relies on abstract complexity theoretic concepts and the theory of quantum computation. As well as providing simplified proofs of previous Hamiltonian universality results, and offering a route to new universal constructions, the results in this paper give insight into the origins of universality. For example, finally explaining the previously noted coincidences between families of universal Hamiltonian and classes of Hamiltonians appearing in complexity theory.	
 Observation of ultra-slow shock waves in a tunable magnetic lattice	Jian Li, Chockalingam, Tal Cohen	None	None	The combination of fast propagation speeds and highly localized nature has hindered the direct observation of the evolution of shock waves at the molecular scale. To address this limitation, an experimental system is designed by tuning a one-dimensional magnetic lattice to evolve benign wave forms into shock waves at observable spatial and temporal scales, thus serving as a ‚Äòmagnifying glass‚Äô to illuminate shock processes. An accompanying analysis confirms that the formation of strong shocks is fully captured. The exhibited lack of a steady state induced by indefinite expansion of a disordered transition zone points to the absence of local thermodynamic equilibrium, and resurfaces lingering questions on the validity of continuum assumptions in presence of strong shocks.	
 Topological transitions during grain growth on a finite element mesh	Erdem Eren, Jeremy Mason	ereren@ucdavis.edu	None	The topological transitions that occur to the grain boundary network during grain growth in a material with uniform grain boundary energies are believed to be known. The same is not true for more realistic materials, since more general grain boundary energies in principle allow many more viable grain boundary configurations. A simulation of grain growth in such a material therefore requires a procedure to enumerate all possible topological transitions and select the most energetically favorable one. Such a procedure is developed and implemented here for a microstructure represented by a volumetric finite element mesh. As a specific example, all possible transitions for a typical configuration with five grains around a junction point are enumerated, and some exceptional transitions are found to be energetically similar to the conventional ones even for a uniform boundary energy. A general discrete formulation to calculate grain boundary velocities is used to simulate grain growth for an example microstructure. The method is implemented as a C++ library based on SCOREC, an open source massively parallelizable library for finite element simulations with adaptive meshing.	
 Position, Padding and Predictions: A Deeper Look at Position Information in CNNs	Md Amirul Islam,Matthew Kowal,Sen Jia,Konstantinos Derpanis,and Neil Bruce	None	None	In contrast to fully connected networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve efficiency by learning weights associated with local filters with a finite spatial extent. An implication of this is that a filter may know what it is looking at, but not where it is positioned in the image. In this paper, we first test this hypothesis and reveal that a surprising degree of absolute position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs. We show that zero padding drives CNNs to encode position information in their internal representations, while a lack of padding precludes position encoding. This gives rise to deeper questions about the role of position information in CNNs: (i) What boundary heuristics enable optimal position encoding for downstream tasks?; (ii) Does position encoding affect the learning of semantic representations?; (iii) Does position encoding always improve performance? To provide answers, we perform the largest case study to date on the role that padding and border heuristics play in CNNs. We design novel tasks which allow us to quantify boundary effects as a function of the distance to the border. Numerous semantic objectives reveal the effect of the border on semantic representations. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of these findings on multiple real-world tasks to show that position information can both help or hurt performance.

 Geodesic length and shifted weights in first-passage percolation	Arjun Krishnan, Firas RassoulAgha, Timo Sepplinen	arjunkc@gmail.com	Arjun KrishnanUniversity of UtahMathematics Department155S 1400ESalt Lake City, UT 84112USA.	We study first-passage percolation through related optimization problems over paths of restricted length. The path length variable is in duality with a shift of the weights. This puts into a convex duality framework old observations about the convergence of the normalized Euclidean length of geodesics due to Hammersley and Welsh, Smythe and Wierman, and Kesten, and leads to new results about geodesic length and the regularity of the shape function as a function of the weight shift. For points far enough away from the origin, the ratio of the geodesic length and the ‚Ñì 1 superscript ‚Ñì 1 \ell^{1} roman_‚Ñì start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT distance to the endpoint is uniformly bounded away from one. The shape function is a strictly concave function of the weight shift. Atoms of the weight distribution generate singularities, that is, points of nondifferentiability, in this function. We generalize to all distributions, directions and dimensions an old singularity result of Steele and Zhang for the planar Bernoulli case. When the weight distribution has two or more atoms, a dense set of shifts produce singularities. The results come from a combination of the convex duality, the shape theorems of the different first-passage optimization problems, and modification arguments.	
 Hyperpolarisation of external nuclear spins using nitrogen-vacancy centre ensembles	Healey, Hall, White, Teraji, MA Sani, Separovic, JP Tetienne, Hollenberg	None	None	The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond has emerged as a candidate to non-invasively hyperpolarise nuclear spins in molecular systems to improve the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Several promising proof of principle experiments have demonstrated small-scale polarisation transfer from single NVs to hydrogen spins outside the diamond. However, the scaling up of these results to the use of a dense NV ensemble, which is a necessary prerequisite for achieving realistic NMR sensitivity enhancement, has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we present evidence for a polarising interaction between a shallow NV ensemble and external nuclear targets over a micrometre scale, and characterise the challenges in achieving useful polarisation enhancement. In the most favourable example of the interaction with hydrogen in a solid state target, a maximum polarisation transfer rate of ‚âà 7500 absent 7500 \approx 7500 ‚âà 7500 spins per second per NV is measured, averaged over an area containing order 10 6 superscript 10 6 10^{6} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT NVs. Reduced levels of polarisation efficiency are found for liquid state targets, where molecular diffusion limits the transfer. Through analysis via a theoretical model, we find that our results suggest implementation of this technique for NMR sensitivity enhancement is feasible following realistic diamond material improvements.	
 The Optimal Dynamic Treatment Rule SuperLearner: Considerations, Performance, and Application	Lina Montoya, Mark van der Laan, Alexander Luedtke, Jennifer Skeem, Jeremy Coyle, Maya Petersen	None	None	The optimal dynamic treatment rule (ODTR) framework offers an approach for understanding which kinds of patients respond best to specific treatments ‚Äì in other words, treatment effect heterogeneity. Recently, there has been a proliferation of methods for estimating the ODTR. One such method is an extension of the SuperLearner algorithm ‚Äì an ensemble method to optimally combine candidate algorithms extensively used in prediction problems ‚Äì to ODTRs. Following the ‚Äúcausal roadmap,‚Äù we causally and statistically define the ODTR and provide an introduction to estimating it using the ODTR SuperLearner. Additionally, we highlight practical choices when implementing the algorithm, including choice of candidate algorithms, metalearners to combine the candidates, and risk functions to select the best combination of algorithms. Using simulations, we illustrate how estimating the ODTR using this SuperLearner approach can uncover treatment effect heterogeneity more effectively than traditional approaches based on fitting a parametric regression of the outcome on the treatment, covariates and treatment-covariate interactions. We investigate the implications of choices in implementing an ODTR SuperLearner at various sample sizes. Our results show the advantages of: (1) including a combination of both flexible machine learning algorithms and simple parametric estimators in the library of candidate algorithms; (2) using an ensemble metalearner to combine candidates rather than selecting only the best-performing candidate; (3) using the mean outcome under the rule as a risk function. Finally, we apply the ODTR SuperLearner to the ‚ÄúInterventions‚Äù study, an ongoing randomized controlled trial, to identify which justice-involved adults with mental illness benefit most from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce criminal re-offending.

 Coalition Game Based Full-duplex Popular Content Distribution in mmWave Vehicular Networks	YibingWang,HaoWu,YongNiu,ZhuHan,,BoAi,,and ZhangduiZhong	None	None	The millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has drawn intensive attention with abundant band resources. In this paper, we consider the popular content distribution (PCD) problem in the mmWave vehicular network. In order to offload the communication burden of base stations (BSs), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is introduced into the PCD problem to transmit contents between on-board units (OBUs) and improve the transmission efficiency. We propose a full-duplex (FD) cooperative scheme based on coalition formation game, and the utility function is provided based on the maximization of the number of received contents. The contribution of each member in the coalition can be transferable to its individual profit. While maximizing the number of received contents in the fixed time, the cooperative scheme also ensures the individual profit of each OBU in the coalition. We evaluate the proposed scheme by extensive simulations in mmWave vehicular networks. Compared with other existing schemes, the proposed scheme has superior performances on the number of possessed contents and system fairness. Besides, the low complexity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the switch operation number and CPU time.	
 Dynamically reversible and strong circular dichroism based on Babinet-invertible chiral metasurfaces	Xiaoqing Luo,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Fangrong HustartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and Guangyuan Li,,,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We propose a Babinet-invertible chiral metasurface for achieving dynamically reversible and strong circular dichroism (CD). The proposed metasurface is composed of VO 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT -metal hybrid structure, and when VO 2 2 {}_{2} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT transits between the dielectric state and the metallic state, the metasurface unit cell switches between complementary structures that are designed according to the Babinet principle. This leads to a large and reversible CD tuning range between ¬± 0.5 plus-or-minus 0.5 \pm 0.5 ¬± 0.5 at 0.97 THz, which is larger than the literature. We attribute the CD effect to extrinsic chirality of the proposed metasurface. We envision that the Babinet-invertible chiral metasurface proposed here will advance the engineering of active and tunable chiro-optical devices and promote their applications.	
 Multi-Dimensional Parameter Study of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae Originating from Thin-Helium-Shell White Dwarfs	Samuel Boos, Dean Townsley, Ken Shen, Spencer Caldwell, Broxton Miles	"Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USADepartment of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USADepartment of Astronomy and Theoretical Astrophysics Center,
University of California, Berkeley, CA, USADepartment of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USAApplied Research Associates, Inc. Raleigh, NC, USA"	None	Despite the importance of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) throughout astronomy, the precise progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that drive SNe Ia are still unknown. An explosion scenario that has gained traction recently is the double detonation in which an accreted shell of He detonates and triggers a secondary detonation in the underlying white dwarf. Our research presents a number of high resolution, multi-dimensional, full star simulations of thin-He-shell, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf progenitors that undergo a double detonation. This suite of thin-shell progenitors incorporates He shells that are thinner than those in previous multi-dimensional studies. We confirm the viability of the double detonation across a range of He shell parameter space as well as present bulk yields and ejecta profiles for each progenitor. The yields obtained are generally consistent with previous works and indicate the likelihood of producing observables that resemble SNe Ia. The dimensionality of our simulations allow us to examine features of the double detonation more closely, including the details of the off-center secondary ignition and asymmetric ejecta. We find considerable differences in the high-velocity extent of post-detonation products across different lines of sight. The data from this work will be used to generate predicted observables and may further support the viability of the double detonation scenario as a SNe Ia channel as well as show how properties of the progenitor or viewing angle may influence trends in observable characteristics.	
 A Pub-Sub Architecture to Promote Blockchain Interoperability This project has been supported by The Linux Foundation as part of the Hyperledger Summer Internships program under the Towards Blockchain Interoperability with Hyperledger project.	Sara Ghaemi, Sara Rouhani, Rafael Belchior, Rui Cruz, Hamzeh Khazaei, Petr Musilek	None	None	The maturing of blockchain technology leads to heterogeneity, where multiple solutions specialize in a particular use case. While the development of different blockchain networks shows great potential for blockchains, the isolated networks have led to data and asset silos, limiting the applications of this technology. Blockchain interoperability solutions are essential to enable distributed ledgers to reach their full potential. Such solutions allow blockchains to support asset and data transfer, resulting in the development of innovative applications.	
 Atomic Swaps between Bitcoin and Monero	Philipp Hoenisch, Lucas Soriano del Pino	None	None	Due to the evergrowing blockchain ecosystem, interoperability has become a matter of great importance. Atomic swaps allow connecting otherwise isolated blockchains while adhering to the core principles of censorship resistance and permissionlessnes. Up until recently, atomic swap protocols have mostly relied on complex script support, excluding certain types of blockchains. With advances in cryptography, it is now possible to build a bridge between almost any two blockchains. In this work, we give an explanation of one such protocol which applies adaptor signatures on Bitcoin to procure atomic swaps between Monero and Bitcoin. We dive into the cryptographic details, discuss its limitations and give an outlook on our current work where we use adaptor signatures on the Monero signature scheme.	
 Performance and Application of Estimators for the Value of an Optimal Dynamic Treatment Rule	Lina Montoya, Jennifer Skeem, Mark van der Laan, Maya Petersen	None	None	Given an (optimal) dynamic treatment rule, it may be of interest to evaluate that rule ‚Äì that is, to ask the causal question: what is the expected outcome had every subject received treatment according to that rule? In this paper, we study the performance of estimators that approximate the true value of: 1) an a priori known dynamic treatment rule 2) the true, unknown optimal dynamic treatment rule (ODTR); 3) an estimated ODTR, a so-called ‚Äúdata-adaptive parameter,‚Äù whose true value depends on the sample. Using simulations of point-treatment data, we specifically investigate: 1) the impact of increasingly data-adaptive estimation of nuisance parameters and/or of the ODTR on performance; 2) the potential for improved efficiency and bias reduction through the use of semiparametric efficient estimators; and, 3) the importance of sample splitting based on CV-TMLE for accurate inference. In the simulations considered, there was very little cost and many benefits to using the cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator (CV-TMLE) to estimate the value of the true and estimated ODTR; importantly, and in contrast to non cross-validated estimators, the performance of CV-TMLE was maintained even when highly data-adaptive algorithms were used to estimate both nuisance parameters and the ODTR. In addition, we apply these estimators for the value of the rule to the ‚ÄúInterventions‚Äù Study, an ongoing randomized controlled trial, to identify whether assigning cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to criminal justice-involved adults with mental illness using an ODTR significantly reduces the probability of recidivism, compared to assigning CBT in a non-individualized way.	
 sGrapp: Butterfly Approximation in Streaming Graphs	Aida Sheshbolouki, Tamer zsu	aida.sheshbolouki@uwaterloo.ca	None	We study the fundamental problem of butterfly (i.e. (2,2)-bicliques) counting in bipartite streaming graphs. Similar to triangles in unipartite graphs, enumerating butterflies is crucial in understanding the structure of bipartite graphs. This benefits many applications where studying the cohesion in a graph shaped data is of particular interest. Examples include investigating the structure of computational graphs or input graphs to the algorithms, as well as dynamic phenomena and analytic tasks over complex real graphs. Butterfly counting is computationally expensive, and known techniques do not scale to large graphs; the problem is even harder in streaming graphs. In this paper, following a data-driven methodology, we first conduct an empirical analysis to uncover temporal organizing principles of butterflies in real streaming graphs and then we introduce an approximate adaptive window-based algorithm, sGrapp, for counting butterflies as well as its optimized version sGrapp-x. sGrapp is designed to operate efficiently and effectively over any graph stream with any temporal behavior. Experimental studies of sGrapp and sGrapp-x show superior performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

 Enabling Robots to Draw and Tell: Towards Visually Grounded Multimodal Description Generation	Ting Han, Sina Zarrie	ting.han@aist.go.jp	None	Socially competent robots should be equipped with the ability to perceive the world that surrounds them and communicate about it in a human-like manner. Representative skills that exhibit such ability include generating image descriptions and visually grounded referring expressions. In the NLG community, these generation tasks are largely investigated in non-interactive and language-only settings. However, in face-to-face interaction, humans often deploy multiple modalities to communicate, forming seamless integration of natural language, hand gestures and other modalities like sketches. To enable robots to describe what they perceive with speech and sketches/gestures, we propose to model the task of generating natural language together with free-hand sketches/hand gestures to describe visual scenes and reallife objects, namely, visually-grounded multimodal description generation. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and evaluation metrics of the task, and how the task can benefit from progress recently made in the natural language processing and computer vision realms, where related topics such as visually grounded NLG, distributional semantics, and photo-based sketch generation have been extensively studied.

 Simple prediction of immiscible metal alloying based on metastability analysis	Shota Ono, Junji Yuhara, Jun Onoe	shota_o@gifu-u.ac.jp	None	It has been known that even though two elemental metals, X ùëã X italic_X and Y ùëå Y italic_Y , are immiscible, they can form alloys on surfaces of other metal Z ùëç Z italic_Z .

 Critical yielding rheology: from externally deformed glasses to active systems	Carlos VillarroelstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Gustavo Dring,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPTstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	We use extensive computer simulations to study the yielding transition under two different loading schemes: standard simple shear dynamics, and self-propelled, dense active systems. In the active systems a yielding transition toward a liquid phase is observed when the self-propulsion is increased. The range of self-propulsions in which this pure liquid regime exists appears to vanish upon approaching the so-called ‚Äòjamming point‚Äô at which solidity of soft-sphere packings is lost. Such an ‚Äòactive yielding‚Äô transition shares similarities with the generic yielding transition for shear flows. A Herschel-Bulkley law is observed along the liquid regime in both loading scenarios, with a clear difference in the critical scaling exponents between the two, suggesting the existent of different universality classes for the yielding transition under different driving conditions. In addition, we present direct measurements of growing length and time scales for both driving scenarios. A comparison with theoretical predictions from recent literature reveals poor agreement with our numerical results.	
 Deep Triplet Hashing Network for Case-based Medical Image Retrieval	Jiansheng, Huazhu, Jiang	None	School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China	Deep hashing methods have been shown to be the most efficient approximate nearest neighbor search techniques for large-scale image retrieval. However, existing deep hashing methods have a poor small-sample ranking performance for case-based medical image retrieval. The top-ranked images in the returned query results may be as a different class than the query image. This ranking problem is caused by classification, regions of interest (ROI), and small-sample information loss in the hashing space. To address the ranking problem, we propose an end-to-end framework, called Attention-based Triplet Hashing (ATH) network, to learn low-dimensional hash codes that preserve the classification, ROI, and small-sample information. We embed a spatial-attention module into the network structure of our ATH to focus on ROI information. The spatial-attention module aggregates the spatial information of feature maps by utilizing max-pooling, element-wise maximum, and element-wise mean operations jointly along the channel axis. To highlight the essential role of classification in diÔ¨Äerentiating case-based medical images, we propose a novel triplet cross-entropy loss to achieve maximal class-separability and maximal hash code-discriminability simultaneously during model training. The triplet cross-entropy loss can help to map the classification information of images and similarity between images into the hash codes. Moreover, by adopting triplet labels during model training, we can utilize the small-sample information fully to alleviate the imbalanced-sample problem. Extensive experiments on two case-based medical datasets demonstrate that our proposed ATH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep hashing methods and boost the ranking performance for small samples. Compared to the other loss methods, the triplet cross-entropy loss can enhance the classification performance and hash code-discriminability.

 A Fast Template Periodogram for Detecting Non-Sinusoidal Fixed-Shape Signals in Irregularly Sampled Time Series	Hoffman,J Vanderplas,JD Hartman,G Bakos	johnh2o2@gmail.com	None	Astrophysical time series often contain periodic signals. The large and growing volume of time series data from photometric surveys demands computationally efficient methods for detecting and characterizing such signals. The most efficient algorithms available for this purpose are those that exploit the ùí™ ( N log ‚Å° N ) ùí™ ùëÅ ùëÅ \mathcal{O}(N\log N) caligraphic_O ( italic_N roman_log italic_N ) scaling of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, these methods are not optimal for non-sinusoidal signal shapes. Template fits (or periodic matched filters) optimize sensitivity for a priori known signal shapes but at a significant computational cost. Current implementations of template periodograms scale as ùí™ ( N f N obs ) ùí™ subscript ùëÅ ùëì subscript ùëÅ obs \mathcal{O}(N_{f}N_{\rm obs}) caligraphic_O ( italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , where N f subscript ùëÅ ùëì N_{f} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the number of trial frequencies and N obs subscript ùëÅ obs N_{\rm obs} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the number of lightcurve observations, and due to non-convexity, they do not guarantee the best fit at each trial frequency, which can lead to spurious results. In this work, we present a non-linear extension of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to obtain a template-fitting algorithm that is both accurate (globally optimal solutions are obtained except in pathological cases) and computationally efficient (scaling as ùí™ ( N f log ‚Å° N f ) ùí™ subscript ùëÅ ùëì subscript ùëÅ ùëì \mathcal{O}(N_{f}\log N_{f}) caligraphic_O ( italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_log italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_f end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) for a given template). The non-linear optimization of the template fit at each frequency is recast as a polynomial zero-finding problem, where the coefficients of the polynomial can be computed efficiently with the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform. We show that our method, which uses truncated Fourier series to approximate templates, is an order of magnitude faster than existing algorithms for small problems ( N ‚â≤ 10 less-than-or-similar-to ùëÅ 10 N\lesssim 10 italic_N ‚â≤ 10 observations) and 2 orders of magnitude faster for long base-line time series with N obs ‚â≥ 10 4 greater-than-or-equivalent-to subscript ùëÅ obs superscript 10 4 N_{\rm obs}\gtrsim 10^{4} italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_obs end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚â≥ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT observations.

Banacha 2, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland"	There are two kinds of bisimulation, namely crisp and fuzzy , between fuzzy structures such as fuzzy automata, fuzzy labeled transition systems, fuzzy Kripke models and fuzzy interpretations in description logics. Fuzzy bisimulations between fuzzy automata over a complete residuated lattice have been introduced by ƒÜiriƒá et al . in 2012. Logical characterizations of fuzzy bisimulations between fuzzy Kripke models (respectively, fuzzy interpretations in description logics) over the residuated lattice [ 0 , 1 ] 0 1 [0,1] [ 0 , 1 ] with the G√∂del t-norm have been provided by Fan in 2015 (respectively, Nguyen et al . in 2020). There was the lack of logical characterizations of fuzzy bisimulations between fuzzy graph-based structures over a general residuated lattice, as well as over the residuated lattice [ 0 , 1 ] 0 1 [0,1] [ 0 , 1 ] with the ≈Åukasiewicz or product t-norm. In this article, we provide and prove logical characterizations of fuzzy bisimulations in fuzzy modal logics over residuated lattices. The considered logics are the fuzzy propositional dynamic logic and its fragments. Our logical characterizations concern invariance of formulas under fuzzy bisimulations and the Hennessy-Milner property of fuzzy bisimulations. They can be reformulated for other fuzzy structures such as fuzzy labeled transition systems and fuzzy interpretations in description logics.

 DNN-Life: An Energy-Efficient Aging Mitigation Framework for Improving the Lifetime of On-Chip Weight Memories in Deep Neural Network Hardware Architectures	Muhammad Abdullah HanifstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Muhammad ShafiquestartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Negative Biased Temperature Instability (NBTI)-induced aging is one of the critical reliability threats in nano-scale devices. This paper makes the first attempt to study the NBTI aging in the on-chip weight memories of deep neural network (DNN) hardware accelerators, subjected to complex DNN workloads. We propose DNN-Life, a specialized aging analysis and mitigation framework for DNNs, which jointly exploits hardware- and software-level knowledge to improve the lifetime of a DNN weight memory with reduced energy overhead. At the software-level, we analyze the effects of different DNN quantization methods on the distribution of the bits of weight values. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, we propose a micro-architecture that employs low-cost memory-write (and read) transducers to achieve an optimal duty-cycle at run time in the weight memory cells, thereby balancing their aging. As a result, our DNN-Life framework enables efficient aging mitigation of weight memory of the given DNN hardware at minimal energy overhead during the inference process.	
 Auxetic behavior on demand: a three steps recipe for new designs	Daniel Acuna,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Francisco Gutirrez,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Rodrigo Silva,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Humberto Palza,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Alvaro Nunez,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Gustavo Dring,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	Despite their outstanding mechanical properties, with many industrial applications, a rational and systematic design of new and controlled auxetic materials remains poorly developed. Here a unified framework is established to describe bidimensional perfect auxetics with potential use in the design of new materials. Perfect auxetics are characterized by a Poisson‚Äôs ratio ŒΩ = ‚àí 1 ùúà 1 \nu=-1 italic_ŒΩ = - 1 over a finite strain range and can be modeled as materials composed of rotating rigid units. Inspired by a natural connection between these rotating rigid units with an antiferromagnetic spin system, here are unveiled the conditions for the emergence of a non-trivial floppy mode responsible for the auxetic behavior. Furthermore, this model paves a simple pathway for the design of new auxetic materials, based on three simple steps, which set the sufficient connectivity and geometrical constraints for perfect auxetics. In particular, a new exotic crystal, a Penrose quasi-crystal and the long desired isotropic auxetic material are designed and constructed for the first time. Using 3D printed materials, finite element methods and this rigid unit model, the auxetic behavior of these designs is shown to be robust under small disturbances in the structure, though the Poisson‚Äôs ratio value relies on system‚Äôs details, approaching ‚àí 1 1 -1 - 1 close to the ideal case.	
 On the capacity of deep generative networks for approximating distributions	Yunfei Yang, Zhen Li, Yang Wang	None	None	We study the efficacy and efficiency of deep generative networks for approximating probability distributions. We prove that neural networks can transform a low-dimensional source distribution to a distribution that is arbitrarily close to a high-dimensional target distribution, when the closeness are measured by Wasserstein distances and maximum mean discrepancy. Upper bounds of the approximation error are obtained in terms of the width and depth of neural network. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error in Wasserstein distance grows at most linearly on the ambient dimension and that the approximation order only depends on the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. On the contrary, when f ùëì f italic_f -divergences are used as metrics of distributions, the approximation property is different. We show that in order to approximate the target distribution in f ùëì f italic_f -divergences, the dimension of the source distribution cannot be smaller than the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution.	
 The Hybrid-dimensional Darcy‚Äôs Law: A Reinterpreted Discrete Fracture Model for Fracture and Barrier Networks on Non-conforming Meshes 1footnote 11footnote 1The second author was funded by Funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China 52074336, the Major Science and Technology Projects of China National Petroleum Corporation ZD2019-183-008, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No.18CX05029A). The last author was funded by the NSF grant DMS-1818467	Ziyao Xu, Zhaoqin Huang, Yang Yang	None	None	In this paper, we extend the reinterpreted discrete fracture model for flow simulation of fractured porous media containing flow blocking barriers on non-conforming meshes. The methodology of the approach is to modify the traditional Darcy‚Äôs law into the hybrid-dimensional Darcy‚Äôs law where fractures and barriers are represented as Dirac- Œ¥ ùõø \delta italic_Œ¥ functions contained in the permeability tensor and resistance tensor, respectively. As a natural extension of the reinterpreted discrete fracture model [ 21 ] for highly conductive fractures, this model is able to account for the influence of both highly conductive fractures and blocking barriers accurately on non-conforming meshes. The local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is employed to accommodate the form of the hybrid-dimensional Darcy‚Äôs law and the nature of the pressure/flux discontinuity. The performance of the model is demonstrated by several numerical tests.

 The hybrid dimensional representation of permeability tensor: a reinterpretation of the discrete fracture model and its extension on nonconforming meshes1footnote 11footnote 1Supported by the NSF grant DMS-1818467	Ziyao Xu,Yang Yang	None	None	The discrete fracture model (DFM) has been widely used in the simulation of fluid flow in fractured porous media. Traditional DFM uses the so-called hybrid-dimensional approach to treat fractures explicitly as low-dimensional entries (e.g. line entries in 2D media and face entries in 3D media) on the interfaces of matrix cells and then couple the matrix and fracture flow systems together based on the principle of superposition with the fracture thickness used as the dimensional homogeneity factor. Because of this methodology, DFM is considered to be limited on conforming meshes and thus may raise difficulties in generating high quality unstructured meshes due to the complexity of fracture‚Äôs geometrical morphology. In this paper, we clarify that the DFM actually can be extended to non-conforming meshes without any essential changes. To show it clearly, we provide another perspective for DFM based on hybrid-dimensional representation of permeability tensor to describe fractures as one-dimensional line Dirac delta functions contained in permeability tensor. A finite element DFM scheme for single-phase flow on non-conforming meshes is then derived by applying Galerkin finite element method to it. Analytical analysis and numerical experiments show that our DFM automatically degenerates to the classical finite element DFM when the mesh is conforming with fractures. Moreover, the accuracy and efficiency of the model on non-conforming meshes are demonstrated by testing several benchmark problems. This model is also applicable to curved fracture with variable thickness.

 Mean Field Games Master Equations with Non-separable Hamiltonians and Displacement Monotonicity	Wilfrid Gangbo, Alpr Mszros, Chenchen Mou, Jianfeng Zhang	wgangbo@math.ucla.edu	Department of Mathematics, UCLA, California, USA	In this manuscript, we propose a structural condition on non-separable Hamiltonians, which we term displacement monotonicity condition, to study second order mean field games master equations. A rate of dissipation of a bilinear form is brought to bear a global (in time) well-posedness theory, based on a priori uniform Lipschitz estimates on the solution in the measure variable. Displacement monotonicity being sometimes in dichotomy with the widely used Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, the novelties of this work persist even when restricted to separable Hamiltonians.	
 Hierarchical excitations from correlated spin tetrahedra on the breathing pyrochlore lattice	Shang Gao, Andrew May, MaoHua Du, Joseph Paddison, Hasitha Suriya Arachchige, Ganesh Pokharel, Clarina dela Cruz, Qiang Zhang, Georg Ehlers, David Parker, David Mandrus, Matthew Stone, Andrew Christianson	None	None	The hierarchy of the coupling strengths in a physical system often engenders an effective model at low energies where the decoupled high-energy modes are integrated out. Here, using neutron scattering, we show that the spin excitations in the breathing pyrochlore lattice compound CuInCr 4 4 {}_{4} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 4 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT S 8 8 {}_{8} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 8 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT are hierarchical and can be approximated by an effective model of correlated tetrahedra at low energies.

Our work illustrates the spin dynamics in CuInCr 4 4 {}_{4} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 4 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT S 8 8 {}_{8} start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 8 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and demonstrates a general effective-cluster approach to understand the dynamics on the breathing-type lattices.	
 Generating nonlinearities from conditional linear operations, squeezing and measurement for quantum computation and super-Heisenberg sensing	Mattias Johnsson, Pablo Poggi, Marco Rodriguez, Rafael Alexander, Jason Twamley	None	None	Large optical nonlinearities can have numerous applications, ranging from the generation of cat-states for optical quantum computation, through to quantum sensing where the sensitivity exceeds Heisenberg scaling in the resources. However, the generation of ultra-large optical nonlinearities has proved immensely challenging experimentally. We describe a novel protocol where one can effectively generate large optical nonlinearities via the conditional application of a linear operation on an optical mode by an ancilla mode, followed by a measurement of the ancilla and corrective operation on the probe mode. Our protocol can generate high quality optical Schr√∂dinger cat states useful for optical quantum computing and can be used to perform sensing of an unknown rotation or displacement in phase space, with super-Heisenberg scaling in the resources. We finally describe a potential experimental implementation using atomic ensembles interacting with optical modes via the Faraday effect.	
 Sharp Bounds on the Approximation Rates, Metric Entropy, and ùëõ-widths of Shallow Neural Networks	Jonathan SiegelDepartment of MathematicsPennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA Jinchao XuDepartment of MathematicsPennsylvania State UniversityUniversity Park, PA	None	None	In this article, we study approximation properties of the variation spaces corresponding to shallow neural networks with a variety of activation functions. We introduce two main tools for estimating the metric entropy, approximation rates, and n ùëõ n italic_n -widths of these spaces. First, we introduce the notion of a smoothly parameterized dictionary and give upper bounds on the non-linear approximation rates, metric entropy and n ùëõ n italic_n -widths of their absolute convex hull. The upper bounds depend upon the order of smoothness of the parameterization. This result is applied to dictionaries of ridge functions corresponding to shallow neural networks, and they improve upon existing results in many cases. Next, we provide a method for lower bounding the metric entropy and n ùëõ n italic_n -widths of variation spaces which contain certain classes of ridge functions. This result gives sharp lower bounds on the L 2 superscript ùêø 2 L^{2} italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT -approximation rates, metric entropy, and n ùëõ n italic_n -widths for variation spaces corresponding to neural networks with a range of important activation functions, including ReLU k ùëò {}^{k} start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT activation functions and sigmoidal activation functions with bounded variation.	
 Deep Generative SToRM model for dynamic imaging			None	We introduce a novel generative smoothness regularization on manifolds (SToRM) model for the recovery of dynamic image data from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed generative framework represents the image time series as a smooth non-linear function of low-dimensional latent vectors that capture the cardiac and respiratory phases. The non-linear function is represented using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike the popular CNN approaches that require extensive fully-sampled training data that is not available in this setting, the parameters of the CNN generator as well as the latent vectors are jointly estimated from the undersampled measurements using stochastic gradient descent. We penalize the norm of the gradient of the generator to encourage the learning of a smooth surface/manifold, while temporal gradients of the latent vectors are penalized to encourage the time series to be smooth. The main benefits of the proposed scheme are (a) the quite significant reduction in memory demand compared to the analysis based SToRM model, and (b) the spatial regularization brought in by the CNN model. We also introduce efficient progressive approaches to minimize the computational complexity of the algorithm.

Moreover, the same domain growth law is observed in the proposed method and the Monte Carlo method.

We define a general model called the m ‚àí limit-from ùëö m- italic_m - uniform sub-hypergraph stochastic block model ( m ‚àí limit-from ùëö m- italic_m - ShSBM). Under the m ‚àí limit-from ùëö m- italic_m - ShSBM, we use Fano‚Äôs inequality to identify the region of model parameters where any algorithm fails to exactly recover the planted communities with a large probability. We also identify the region where a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm succeeds to exactly recover the communities with high probability. Our bounds are tight and pertain to the community detection problems in various models such as the planted hypergraph stochastic block model, the planted densest sub-hypergraph model, and the planted multipartite hypergraph model.

 How will our knowledge of short gamma-ray bursts affect the distance measurement of binary neutron stars?	Minghui DU, Lixin XU	None	Institute of Theoretical Physics, School of Physics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, 116024, P. R. China	Gravitational waves from binary neutron stars associated with short gamma-ray bursts have drawn considerable attention due to their prospect in cosmology. For such events, the sky locations of sources can be pinpointed with techniques such as identifying the host galaxies. However, the cosmological applications of these events still suffer from the problem of degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle. To address this issue, a technique was proposed in previous study, i.e., using the collimation property of short gamma-ray bursts. Based on the observations, we assume that the cosine of inclination follows a Gaussian distribution, which may act as a prior in the Bayes analysis to break the degeneracy. This paper investigates the effects of different Gaussian priors and detector configurations on distance measurement and cosmological research. We first derive a simplified Fisher information matrix for demonstration, and then conduct quantitative analyses via simulation. By varying the number of third-generation detectors and the scale of prior, we generate four catalogs of 1,000 events. It is shown that, in the same detecting period, a network of detectors can recognize more and farther events than a single detector. Besides, adopting tighter prior and employing multiple detectors both decrease the error of luminosity distance. Also considered is the performance of a widely adopted formula in the error budget, which turns out to be a conservative choice in each case. As for cosmological applications, for the Œõ Œõ \Lambda roman_Œõ CDM model, 500, 200, 600, and 300 events are required for the four configurations to achieve 1 % percent 1 1\% 1 % H 0 subscript ùêª 0 H_{0} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT accuracy. With all 1,000 events in each catalog, H 0 subscript ùêª 0 H_{0} italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Œ© m subscript Œ© ùëö \Omega_{m} roman_Œ© start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be constrained to ( 0.66 % percent 0.66 0.66\% 0.66 % , 0.37 % percent 0.37 0.37\% 0.37 % , 0.76 % percent 0.76 0.76\% 0.76 % , 0.49 % percent 0.49 0.49\% 0.49 % ), and ( 0.010, 0.006, 0.013, 0.010 ), respectively. The results of the Gaussian process also show that the gravitational wave standard siren can serve as a probe of cosmology at high redshifts.	
 Adversarial Learning with Cost-Sensitive Classes	HaojingShen,SihongChen,RanWang,,XizhaoWang	None	None	It is necessary to improve the performance of some special classes or to particularly protect them from attacks in adversarial learning. This paper proposes a framework combining cost-sensitive classification and adversarial learning together to train a model that can distinguish between protected and unprotected classes, such that the protected classes are less vulnerable to adversarial examples. We find in this framework an interesting phenomenon during the training of deep neural networks, called Min-Max property, that is, the absolute values of most parameters in the convolutional layer approach zero while the absolute values of a few parameters are significantly larger becoming bigger. Based on this Min-Max property which is formulated and analyzed in a view of random distribution, we further build a new defense model against adversarial examples for adversarial robustness improvement. An advantage of the built model is that it performs better than the standard one and can combine with adversarial training to achieve an improved performance. It is experimentally confirmed that, regarding the average accuracy of all classes, our model is almost as same as the existing models when an attack does not occur and is better than the existing models when an attack occurs. Specifically, regarding the accuracy of protected classes, the proposed model is much better than the existing models when an attack occurs.	
 The Evolutionary Pathways of Disk-, Bulge-, and Halo-dominated Galaxies	Min Du, Luis Ho, Victor Debattista, Annalisa Pillepich, Dylan Nelson, Lars Hernquist, Rainer Weinberger	None	None	To break the degeneracy among galactic stellar components, we extract kinematic structures using the framework described in Du et al. ( 2019 , 2020 ) . For example, the concept of stellar halos is generalized to weakly-rotating structures that are composed of loosely bound stars, which can hence be associated to both disk and elliptical type morphologies. By applying this method to central galaxies with stellar mass 10 10 ‚àí 11.5 M ‚äô superscript 10 10 11.5 subscript ùëÄ direct-product 10^{10-11.5}\ M_{\odot} 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 - 11.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from the TNG50 simulation, we identify three broadly-defined types of galaxies: ones dominated by disk, by bulge, or by stellar halo structures. We then use the simulation to infer the underlying connection between the growth of structures and physical processes over cosmic time. Tracing galaxies back in time, we recognize three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution ( z ‚â≥ 2 greater-than-or-equivalent-to ùëß 2 z\gtrsim 2 italic_z ‚â≥ 2 ), and internal and external (mainly mergers) processes that act at later times. We find that disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies are not significantly affected by mergers since z ‚àº 2 similar-to ùëß 2 z\sim 2 italic_z ‚àº 2 ; the difference in their present-day structures originates from two distinct evolutionary pathways, extended vs. compact, that are likely determined by their parent dark matter halos; i.e., nature. On the other hand, slow rotator elliptical galaxies are typically halo-dominated, forming by external processes (e.g. mergers) in the later phase, i.e., nurture. This picture challenges the general idea that elliptical galaxies are the same objects as classical bulges. In observations, both bulge- and halo-dominated galaxies are likely to be classified as early-type galaxies with compact morphology and quiescent star formation. However, here we find them to have very different evolutionary histories.

 Blockchain-empowered Data-driven Networks: A Survey and Outlook	Xi LiZehua WangVictor CM LeungHong JiYiming LiuHeli Zhang	None	None	The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks, and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.

 NeMo: Neural Mesh Models of Contrastive Features for Robust 3D Pose Estimation	Angtian Wang, Adam Kortylewski, Alan YuilleDepartment of Computer ScienceJohns Hopkins UniversityMaryland, MD , USA	None	None	3D pose estimation is a challenging but important task in computer vision. In this work, we show that standard deep learning approaches to 3D pose estimation are not robust when objects are partially occluded or viewed from a previously unseen pose. Inspired by the robustness of generative vision models to partial occlusion, we propose to integrate deep neural networks with 3D generative representations of objects into a unified neural architecture that we term NeMo. In particular, NeMo learns a generative model of neural feature activations at each vertex on a dense 3D mesh. Using differentiable rendering we estimate the 3D object pose by minimizing the reconstruction error between NeMo and the feature representation of the target image. To avoid local optima in the reconstruction loss, we train the feature extractor to maximize the distance between the individual feature representations on the mesh using contrastive learning. Our extensive experiments on PASCAL3D+, occluded-PASCAL3D+ and ObjectNet3D show that NeMo is much more robust to partial occlusion and unseen pose compared to standard deep networks, while retaining competitive performance on regular data. Interestingly, our experiments also show that NeMo performs reasonably well even when the mesh representation only crudely approximates the true object geometry with a cuboid, hence revealing that the detailed 3D geometry is not needed for accurate 3D pose estimation. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Angtian/NeMo .

Machine learning methods are used to train a model for real-time prediction of force, torque, and contact using the tactile data collected. We further integrated such fingers in a reconfigurable gripper design with three fingers so that the finger arrangement can be actively adjusted in real-time based on the tactile data collected during grasping, achieving the process of rigid-soft interactive grasping. Detailed sensor calibration and experimental results are also included to further validate the proposed design for enhanced grasping robustness.

 Potential well in Poincar√© recurrence	Miguel Abadi, Vitor Amorim, Sandro Gallo	None	None	From a physical/dynamical system perspective, the potential well represents the proportional mass of points that escape the neighbourhood of a given point. In the last 20 years, several works have shown the importance of this quantity to obtain precise approximations for several recurrence time distributions in mixing stochastic processes and dynamical systems. Besides providing a review of the different scaling factors used in the literature in recurrence times, the present work contribute with two new results: (1) for œï italic-œï \phi italic_œï -mixing and œà ùúì \psi italic_œà -mixing processes, we give a new exponential approximation for hitting and return times using the potential well as scaling parameter. The error terms are explicit and sharp. (2) We analyse the uniform positivity of the potential well.

 Rates of convergence for the number of zeros of random trigonometric polynomials	Laure Coutin, Liliana Peralta	laure.coutin@math.univ-toulouse.fr	"Institut de math√©matiques de Toulouse, Universit√© Paul Sabatier,
118, route de Narbonne F-31062 Toulouse cedex 9, France"	In this paper, we quantify the rate of convergence between the distribution of number of zeros of random trigonometric polynomials (RTP) with i.i.d. centered random coefficients and the number of zeros of a stationary centered Gaussian process G ùê∫ G italic_G , whose covariance function is given by the sinc function. First, we find the convergence of the RTP towards G ùê∫ G italic_G in the Wasserstein ‚àí 1 1 -1 - 1 distance, which in turn is a consequence of Donsker Theorem. Then, we use this result to derive the rate of convergence between their respective number of zeros. Since the number of real zeros of the RTP is not a continuous function, we use the Kac-Rice formula to express it as the limit of an integral and, in this way, we approximate it by locally Lipschitz continuous functions.

Further, to enhance the IRS channel gain of the legitimate user while restricting the IRS channel gain of the eavesdropper, we formulate an achievable secrecy rate maximization problem for the proposed IRS-aided PLS technique to find the optimal orientations of mirrors. Since the sensitivity of mirrors‚Äô orientations on the IRS channel gain makes the optimization problem hard to solve, we transform the original problem into a reflected spot position optimization problem and solve it by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our simulation results show that secrecy performance can be significantly improved by adding an IRS in a VLC system.	
 Emergent Gravity as the Eraser of Anomalous Gauge Boson Masses, and QFT-GR Concord	Durmu Demir	None	None	In the same base setup as Sakharov‚Äôs induced gravity, we investigate emergence of gravity in effective quantum field theories (QFT), with particular emphasis on the gauge sector in which gauge bosons acquire anomalous masses in proportion to the ultraviolet cutoff Œõ ‚Ñò subscript Œõ Weierstrass-p \Lambda_{\wp} roman_Œõ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ñò end_POSTSUBSCRIPT . Drawing on the fact that Œõ ‚Ñò 2 superscript subscript Œõ Weierstrass-p 2 \Lambda_{\wp}^{2} roman_Œõ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ñò end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT corrections explicitly break the gauge and Poincare symmetries, we find that it is possible to map Œõ ‚Ñò 2 superscript subscript Œõ Weierstrass-p 2 \Lambda_{\wp}^{2} roman_Œõ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ñò end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to spacetime curvature as a covariance relation and we find also that this map erases the anomalous gauge boson masses. The resulting framework describes gravity by the general relativity (GR) and matter by the QFT itself with log ‚Å° Œõ ‚Ñò subscript Œõ Weierstrass-p \log\Lambda_{\wp} roman_log roman_Œõ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ñò end_POSTSUBSCRIPT corrections (dimensional regularization). This QFT-GR concord predicts existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model such that the new physics can be a weakly-interacting or even a non-interacting sector comprising the dark matter, dark energy and possibly more. The concord has consequential implications for collider, astrophysical and cosmological phenomena.	
 Diagnosing a Solar Flaring Core with Bidirectional Quasi-Periodic Fast Propagating Magnetoacoustic Waves	Yuhu Miao, Dong Li, Ding Yuan, Chaowei Jiang, Abouazza Elmhamdi, Mingyu Zhao, Sergey Anfinogentov	miaoyuhu@hit.edu.cn	None	Quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) waves are often excited by solar flares, and could be trapped in the coronal structure with low Alfv√©n speed, so they could be used as a diagnosing tool for both the flaring core and magnetic waveguide. As the periodicity of a QFP wave could originate from a periodic source or be dispersively waveguided, it is a key parameter for diagnosing the flaring core and waveguide. In this paper, we study two QFP waves excited by a GOES -class C1.3 solar flare occurring at active region NOAA 12734 on 8 March 2019. Two QFP waves were guided by two oppositely oriented coronal funnel. The periods of two QFP waves were identical and were roughly equal to the period of the oscillatory signal in the X-ray and 17 GHz radio emission released by the flaring core. It is very likely that the two QFP waves could be periodically excited by the flaring core. Many features of this QFP wave event is consistent with the magnetic tuning fork model. We also investigated the seismological application with QFP waves, and found that the magnetic field inferred with magnetohydrodynamic seismology was consistent with that obtained in magnetic extrapolation model. Our study suggest that the QFP wave is a good tool for diagnosing both the flaring core and the magnetic waveguide.

 Existence of a Phase with Finite Localization Length in the Double Scaling Limit of N-Orbital Models	Vincent Sacksteder IV	vincent@sacksteder.com	None	Among the models of disordered conduction and localization, models with N ùëÅ N italic_N orbitals per site are attractive both for their mathematical tractability and for their physical realization in coupled disordered grains. However Wegner proved that there is no Anderson transition and no localized phase in the N ‚Üí ‚àû ‚Üí ùëÅ N\rightarrow\infty italic_N ‚Üí ‚àû limit, if the hopping constant K ùêæ K italic_K is kept fixed. Wegner ( 1979 ); Khorunzhy and Pastur ( 1993 ) Here we show that the localized phase is preserved in a different limit where N ùëÅ N italic_N is taken to infinity and the hopping K ùêæ K italic_K is simultaneously adjusted to keep N K ùëÅ ùêæ N\,K italic_N italic_K constant. We support this conclusion with two arguments. The first is numerical computations of the localization length showing that in the N ‚Üí ‚àû ‚Üí ùëÅ N\rightarrow\infty italic_N ‚Üí ‚àû limit the site-diagonal-disorder model possesses a localized phase if N K ùëÅ ùêæ N\,K italic_N italic_K is kept constant, but does not possess that phase if K ùêæ K italic_K is fixed. The second argument is a detailed analysis of the energy and length scales in a functional integral representation of the gauge invariant model. The analysis shows that in the K ùêæ K italic_K fixed limit the functional integral‚Äôs spins do not exhibit long distance fluctuations, i.e. such fluctuations are massive and therefore decay exponentially, which signals conduction. In contrast the N K ùëÅ ùêæ N\,K italic_N italic_K fixed limit preserves the massless character of certain spin fluctuations, allowing them to fluctuate over long distance scales and cause Anderson localization.	
 Data-driven MHD simulation of successive solar plasma eruptions	Takafumi Kaneko, SungHong Park, Kanya Kusano	None	None	Solar flares and plasma eruptions are sudden releases of magnetic energy stored in the plasma atmosphere. To understand the physical mechanisms governing their occurrences, three-dimensional magnetic fields from the photosphere up to the corona must be studied. The solar photospheric magnetic fields are observable, whereas the coronal magnetic fields cannot be measured. One method for inferring coronal magnetic fields is performing data-driven simulations, which involves time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic fields with the bottom boundary of magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We developed a data-driven method in which temporal evolutions of the observational vector magnetic field can be reproduced at the bottom boundary in the simulation by introducing an inverted velocity field. This velocity field is obtained by inversely solving the induction equation and applying an appropriate gauge transformation. Using this method, we performed a data-driven simulation of successive small eruptions observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Magnetic Activity Telescope in November 2017. The simulation well reproduced the converging motion between opposite-polarity magnetic patches, demonstrating successive formation and eruptions of helical flux ropes.	
 Multiple ground-state instabilities in the anisotropic quantum Rabi model	XiangYou ChenstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Liwei Duan,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, Daniel Braak,,daggerstartFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and QingHu Chen,,,,startFLOATSUPERSCRIPT , , endFLOATSUPERSCRIPT	None	None	In this work, the anisotropic variant of the quantum Rabi model with different coupling strengths of the rotating and counter-rotating wave terms is studied by the Bogoliubov operator approach. The anisotropy preserves the parity symmetry of the original model. We derive the corresponding G ùê∫ G italic_G -function, which yields both the regular and exceptional eigenvalues. The exceptional eigenvalues correspond to the crossing points of two energy levels with different parities and are doubly degenerate. We find analytically that the ground-state and the first excited state can cross several times, indicating multiple first-order phase transitions as function of the coupling strength. These crossing points are related to manifest parity symmetry of the Hamiltonian, in contrast to the level crossings in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model which are caused by a hidden symmetry.
